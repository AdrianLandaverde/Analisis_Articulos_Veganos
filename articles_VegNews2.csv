"STUDY: VEGETARIANS LIVE LONGER, CUT DISEASE RISK",https://vegnews.com/2012/10/study-vegetarians-live-longer-cut-disease-risk,"OCTOBER 15, 2012","Loma Linda University’s School of Public Health recently released some of the findings from its current Adventist Health Study-2, and the results make a convincing argument for plant-based eating. The study is currently following roughly 96,000 Seventh-day Adventists with a variety of dietary habits, although many Adventists are vegetarian or vegan due to religious belief. Vegetarian Adventist men were found to live to an average age of 83.3, 9.5 years longer than other Californian citizens, and women to 85.7, 6.1 years longer than their omnivorous counterparts. Additionally, the study found that men who consume beef more than three times per week are more than twice as likely to die of heart disease, and women with a diet high in meat and cheese have a more than doubled risk of developing ovarian cancer. Loma Linda University includes more details and statistics on its official website for the study. "

My food has flavor.” The restaurateur previously opened Dallas-based VSpot Vegan Café and Bliss Raw Café and Elixir Bar, but has sold both businesses. "
MICHAEL VICK REVEALS OWNERSHIP OF COMPANION DOG,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/michael-vick-reveals-ownership-of-companion-dog,"OCTOBER 14, 2012","Due to speculation after posting a photo to Twitter with a box of dog treats visible in his home, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick—who was convicted of felony dog-fighting charges in 2007—told gossip outlet TMZ last week that his family does indeed have a companion dog now. “I understand the strong emotions … about our family’s decision to care for a pet. As a father, it is important to make sure my children develop a healthy relationship with animals … Our pet is well cared for and loved … This is an opportunity to break the cycle … I will continue to honor my commitment to animal welfare and be an instrument of positive change.” Vick previously teamed up with The Humane Society of the United States for a campaign aimed at raising awareness of animal cruelty.

EATING VEGETABLES AND FRUIT CAN INCREASE HAPPINESS,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/eating-vegetables-and-fruit-can-increase-happiness,"OCTOBER 14, 2012","In a study conducted by the University of Warwick and Dartmouth College researchers and published in the journal Social Indicators Research, a group of participants’ mental well-being was observed as well as the amount of produce the participants consumed. Researchers found that the participants that consumed approximately seven 80-gram servings of fruit and vegetables each day felt the happiest. The study ran from 2007 to 2010 and was comprised of 80,000 people from Great Britain. The study’s findings confirm the belief that a high intake of produce is not only beneficial to physical health, but to mental health as well. "
ALICIA SILVERSTONE ASKS FOR BOOK CONTRIBUTORS,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/alicia-silverstone-asks-for-book-contributors,"OCTOBER 14, 2012","In August, VegNews reported that Alicia Silverstone had two more books in the works, including a pregnancy-related book: The Kind Mama. On October 10, the vegan actress and author published a post on her blog thekindlife.com asking if any readers would like to share their vegan pregnancy stories to be featured in the tome. Interested followers are asked to answer questions such as “Did you ever hesitate about having a vegan pregnancy?” and “During your pregnancy, how did you deal with naysayers?” The Kind Mama is due out in 2014, along with the culinary follow-up to The Kind Diet—The Kind Cookbook.

VEGAN RYE COOKIES,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/vegan-rye-cookies,"OCTOBER 14, 2012","When the concept of a rye-based cookie was presented to us, we were a little skeptical. See, when we think of rye, we imagine a big ol’ vegan Reuben, not a dessert-y baked good. But we were blown away once we actually got a taste of New York-based Black and Blanco’s Sandcastles—flavors like Vanilla Black Sesame, Marzipan, and Maple-Dusted Cardamom truly embody the best of both East and West, offering a gentle sweetness and crisp but buttery texture with a generous dose of rich flavor. We also love that they’re organic and free of wheat, GMOs, preservatives, and refined sugars, as well as corn, soy, and canola. Sometimes, less really is more. "
HOW TO SURVIVE A CROSS-COUNTRY VEGAN ROAD TRIP,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/how-to-survive-a-cross-country-vegan-road-trip,"OCTOBER 14, 2012","How many times have you wanted to get in your car and drive away? Grab your best friend or your partner, or perhaps go solo, and hit the road, Jack Kerouac style? Driving across the country is indeed the stuff that dreams are made of. And then, just like that, we were given our chance. Mariann, who teaches animal law at a handful of schools in New York City, was invited to teach for a semester at the prestigious Lewis & Clark Law School Center for Animal Law in Portland, OR. Since we could hardly leave home for six months without bringing our Vitamix, our podcast microphone, or our glorious rescued pit bull, Rose, air travel seemed out of the question. And what better way to really see America than to get in the Grandmamobile (our loving nickname for Jasmin’s grandmother’s 2005 Buick), skip the interstates, and hit the two-lane highways that go smack through the heartland?

Throughout our 19-day journey, we traversed New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Not bad for a couple of carless New Yorkers who consider a trip to Brooklyn to be a major commitment.

Just as we’d dreamed, while taking Our Hen House on the road, we got a sneak peek into vegan restaurants, microbreweries, farmed-animal sanctuaries, the homes of vegan cookbook authors, and animal-rights events—not to mention the opportunity to connect with folks everywhere working to end animal cruelty. Fortunately, we ignored advice from podcast listeners urging us to pack freeze-dried food (“This is not New York, girls! You will starve!”), and, as a result, our experience was anything but deprived. The proof is in the vegan pudding. Things are starting to change, and people are beginning to wake up everywhere you go.

With that, we bring you our top five highlights from traveling the country the vegan way, followed by tips for anyone interested in following our bread crumb trail and taking off on your own vegan gallivant.

5 Highlights from the Vegan Road As you can see, our big vegan road trip was full of ethically sourced surprises and delicious detours. For those of you planning your own road trip, here are some tips we picked up.

5 Tips for the Vegan Road-Tripper As the story goes, we are now finally settling into Portland life—one that is full of healthy “bowls,” half-marathons, and, yes, rainy days. And though it’s hard to believe, it’s almost time to pack our Vitamix and our dog, and head back to New York City, on our second glorious road trip of the year. Taking a different route eastbound, we will yet again be venturing onto undiscovered terrain even better equipped than before and unable to contain our excitement about what the next bend in the road has in store.

COLBERT REPORT STUDIOS GO MEAT-FREE FOR MORRISSEY,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/colbert-report-studios-go-meat-free-for-morrissey,"OCTOBER 13, 2012","For his October 9 appearance on The Colbert Report, vegetarian rocker Morrissey requested that the show’s studio space and green room become a meat-free environment. Host and comedian Stephen Colbert broached the subject of Morrissey’s request during their on-air interview, calling the British musician a militant vegetarian and joking about being woozy from a lack of bacon. The rocker retorted that animals are conscious beings who are “nicer than humans,” and that just because one’s grandmother “will probably be tasty” doesn’t equate to a reasonable explanation to eat her. Colbert and the show’s staff went vegetarian for the day to honor the Meat is Murder star’s stance—a request he makes of all the venues he visits while on tour. "
CONSUMPTION OF TOMATOES LOWERS RISK OF STROKE,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/consumption-of-tomatoes-lowers-risk-of-stroke,"OCTOBER 12, 2012","Tomatoes have been making headlines recently for their ability to decrease the likelihood of stroke among men. In a 12-year study of more than 1,000 Finnish men ranging in age from 46 to 65, researchers monitored lycopene levels (an antioxidant found in tomatoes) and recorded whether participants suffered strokes. The study revealed that those with high blood levels of lycopene had a 55 percent reduced chance of having a stroke. Tomatoes are among many disease-fighting fruits and vegetables, which help prevent cancer, inflammation, and high blood pressure, as well as other afflictions. Stroke is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. "

In a statement, Wendy’s announced that it will sever all ties with the dairy supplier, while Kraft Foods Inc. is taking action to ban tail docking in its supply chain. Kraft is the first major corporation to implement a mandatory phase-out of the practice—a painful procedure that permanently removes all or part of the tail, leaving cattle vulnerable to maggot infestation, also known as “fly strike.” Three workers at the farm, including one manager, have been charged with criminal cruelty to animals as a result of the video.

POPULARITY OF VEGAN DIET GROWING AMONG BLACK MEN,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/popularity-of-vegan-diet-growing-among-black-men,"OCTOBER 11, 2012","In a recent article on thegrio.com, Dr. Tyeese Gaines, the website’s health editor, explores the growing popularity of veganism amongst black men. Gaines notes that interest in a plant-based lifestyle is growing thanks to recognizable faces adopting vegan and vegetarian diets, including Texans running back Arian Foster, musician André 3000, and former boxer Mike Tyson. Additionally, the continued exposure of the health benefits of vegan diets in mainstream media has helped increase awareness. Gaines also mentions that many members of the black community are interested in veganism because it is seen as a return to the traditional, natural, or cultural eating habits of years past. Veganism has an established foundation amongst black women thanks to trailblazing publications such as Breeze Harper’s Sistah Vegan. "

8 TIPS FOR SURVIVING AS A SMALL-TOWN VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/8-tips-for-surviving-as-a-small-town-vegan,"OCTOBER 7, 2012","Life must be so easy for vegans who are lucky enough to live in Portland, where the streets are lined with nutritional yeast, or Chicago, where the clouds are made of Dandies marshmallows. For herbivores who live in small towns (and even some not-so-veg-friendly mid-size cities), keeping the vegan faith can be a little trickier. But before you throw your hands up in frustration and go for the bacon, take a moment to check out some advice from a few vegans who have been paving the meat-free way in their one-horse towns for years.  When dining out …  1. Call ahead.
Vegan food is everywhere. Sometimes it just takes a little work to find it. Before heading to a non-vegan restaurant, call ahead and inquire about ways to easily veganize dishes on the menu. A vegetable-topped pizza with no cheese or a plate of pasta with marinara are easy options, but get creative. Many chefs are happily up for a challenge. “Most [of the restaurants in my town] don’t have a vegan menu or many vegan options, but I’ve found most restaurants will make me something tasty if I ask nicely,” says Paul Jarvis, a vegan who lives in the tiny town of Tofino, British Columbia (population: 1,876). 2. Bring your own food.
If a cheese-less pizza doesn’t sound all that appetizing, bring some vegan cheese from home. That’s what Kohlrabi & Quince blogger Kelly Reckas of Auberry, CA (population: 2,369) does when she makes the 20-minute drive to the nearest town with a pizza parlor. “If I’m craving something melty on my pizza, they’ll put vegan cheese on it if I bring it in,” Reckas said. Tote along items such as guacamole, vegan sour cream, nutritional yeast, or even vegan deli slices to take a boring restaurant meal up three notches. 3. Fast food can be your friend.
This tip may not work in blink-or-you’ll-miss-them towns, but most mid-sized towns have a fast food chain or two. Where there’s a Subway or a Taco Bell, there is a vegan meal to be had. Check smart phone apps like Vegan Xpress or VegFast for a comprehensive list of vegan options at fast food joints and chain restaurants. 4. Go ethnic.
More Than Tofu and Sprouts blogger Marti Miller Hall lives in Graham, WA (population: 23,491), and although it’s not the tiniest of towns, Hall says there are no vegan or vegetarian restaurants to speak of. But she finds plenty to eat at ethnic joints. “I have closely, carefully, and politely questioned the local Mexican, Thai, and teriyaki places, and I know fairly confidently what I can order there,” Hall says. “Ask to see the carton or product label of sauces. They are usually willing to show you if you are polite.” Things to look out for: fish sauce at Thai joints, lard at Mexican restaurants, and ghee (clarified butter) in Indian and Ethiopian eateries. When shopping for vegan groceries … 5. Get to know the owners.
Nothing beats a little face-to-face conversation with the owner of a restaurant or store when seeking vegan menu items or products. Hall prints out information on vegan products she’d like to see in her supermarket and hands them to owners and managers. She even convinced a local drive-through espresso stand to start stocking almond milk for her coffee, and it’s now requested by lots of customers. 6. Order vegan items online.
It’s easier than ever to be vegan in the age of the internet. Sites like veganessentials.com, foodfghtgrocery.com, and veganstore.com offer products from Teese cheese or Frozen Tofurky pizzas. Stock up to avoid frequent shipping charges, and sign up for the websites’ newsletters to receive coupon codes and sale information. When you want to meet other vegans … 7. Make friends online.
Before Vegan Omaha founder and blogger John McDevitt started a meetup.com group several years ago, there wasn’t a sense of community amongst vegans in the mid-size, Midwest city. But through the power of the internet, McDevitt organized a tight social group that meets regularly at veg-friendly restaurants. “Search meetup.com or Facebook for any groups in your area,” McDevitt says. “Or better yet, start your own group. Chances are there are people just like you. Community is important when you’re going vegan.” 8. Spread the vegan gospel.
Perhaps the best way to make vegan friends in a non-vegan town is to make new vegans. Start by taking vegan cookies or treats to the office or share a vegan pie with a neighbor. Avoid being preachy, but let your friends know how great you feel on your vegan diet. Host potlucks and challenge your omni friends to make a vegan dish. Eventually, some of those friends may decide to follow in your footsteps and at least give up some (if not all) meat. Bianca Phillips blogs at Vegan Crunk and is the author of Cookin’ Crunk: Eatin’ Vegan in the Dirty South. "

Steve-O also commented on how the switch to a meat- and dairy-free lifestyle has improved his health saying that it is nearly unheard of to hear a vegan complain about not feeling well or having troubles sleeping.

In his third book, Tim Gunn’s Fashion Bible: The Fascinating History of Everything in Your Closet, Gunn was careful to encourage readers to leave one particular item off the hanger—fur. In his chapter “Coats and Jackets,” Gunn dutifully explains how meeting with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animal’s Vice President Dan Mathews during his time at Liz Claiborne Inc. changed his perceptions. “I became convinced that fur was unnecessary and even immoral,” says Gunn, who subsequently implemented changes to make Claiborne fur-free, and further notes that “fur belongs in the dustbin of history.” Thanks to Gunn, who was PETA’s 2009 Man of the Year, Project Runway is also fur-free.

In the report from the International Livestock Research Institute, which states that infectious diseases caused from animals—zoonotic diseases—result in roughly 2.5 billion human illnesses and 2.7 million deaths globally each year. Greger stresses as our society has increased meat consumption, the number of infectious diseases has also risen. Additionally, Greger notes that the most efficient way to decrease the rate of infectious diseases in the US is to move toward animal welfare on farms and free livestock from their confining cages. "

FILMMAKER JAMES CAMERON GOES MEAT- AND DAIRY-FREE,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/filmmaker-james-cameron-goes-meat-and-dairy-free,"OCTOBER 3, 2012","In 2009, acclaimed filmmaker James Cameron showed his interest in environmental action in his blockbuster hit Avatar by demonstrating how people’s actions can negatively impact the planet. More recently, the filmmaker has taken to changing his diet and lifestyle to encourage more sustainable living by switching to a plant-based diet and motivating his family members to do the same. In an interview with the Calgary Herald, Cameron discussed his recent switch to animal-free foods. “It’s not a requirement to eat animals, we just choose to do it, so it becomes a moral choice and one that is having a huge impact on the planet, using up resources and destroying the biosphere,” says Cameron.

LAW BANNING HUNTING IN COSTA RICA NEARS APPROVAL,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/law-banning-hunting-in-costa-rica-nears-approval,"OCTOBER 3, 2012","Costa Rica is primed be the first Latin American country to outlaw hunting as a sport. Following a recent approval from Congress on reforms to its Wildlife Conservation Law the bill may go into effect if the second vote is sucessful. The changes aim to protect the region’s diverse and exotic wildlife, while also protecting the country’s tourism-reliant economy, which collects roughly $2.1 billion each year. Tropical rainforests, sandy beaches, and national parks—which bring in around 300,000 visitors per year—are a large draw, and are home to highly prized “trophy” animals such as jaguars, pumas, and sea turtles. While the ban would be nation-wide, it would not apply to scientific research or to the country’s indigenous groups who rely on hunting for survival. "
WAYNE PACELLE HOPES TO JOIN TYSON FOODS BOARD,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/wayne-pacelle-hopes-to-join-tyson-foods-board,"OCTOBER 3, 2012","Wayne Pacelle, President and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, is running for a position on the board of directors at Tyson Foods. Pacelle’s quest to join the board is part of a larger strategy to eliminate gestation crates from pork supply chains across the country—a change that Tyson is resisting. On his blog, Pacelle states “the company is not only making the wrong moral decision, but the wrong business decision too,” noting he has the support of billionaire investor Carl Icahn and hopes to convince the shareholders that his place on the board is necessary as consumers demand that companies make animal welfare a priority. In a press statement, Icahn wrote that eliminating the confining crates would improve Tyson’s business prospects and keep them in line industry leaders already rejecting gestation crates. "
ALDF SUES JUDY’S EGGS FOR FALSE ADVERTISING,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/aldf-sues-judys-eggs-for-false-advertising,"OCTOBER 2, 2012","The Animal Legal Defense Fund filed a class-action lawsuit Monday against California egg producer Judy’s Eggs for using packaging that misleads consumers. Judy’s Family Farm Organic Eggs, owned by Petaluma Egg Farm, uses packaging depicting a hen roaming freely on green grass, and the inside of the packaging reads “these hens are raised in wide open spaces in Sonoma Valley, where they are free to ‘roam, scratch, and play.’” However, in an aerial photo of the farm obtained by ALDF, no birds can be seen outside, and the land is instead occupied by long, factory farm-style sheds. “The lack of clarity regarding ‘cage-free’ and ‘free-range’ eggs is one of the reasons why this false advertising lawsuit is so important,” asserts ALDF Litigation Fellow Chris Berry.

SCHOLARS DEMAND FULL DISCLOSURE OF ANIMAL TESTING,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/scholars-demand-full-disclosure-of-animal-testing,"OCTOBER 2, 2012","A group of editors from the Journal of Animal Ethics were recently published by the University of Illinois Press expressing their hope for the public to have full disclosure as to what sort of testing occurs during drug development. The editors assert that consumers should be aware of any and all suffering of animals that took place in order to create prescription drugs. “Let the facts and the history be known. Let us not shirk the details. Anything less may serve particular interests but is less than the full disclosure we have a right to expect,” the JAE states in the report. The journal’s primary purpose is to bring more attention to the debate regarding the ethical status of animals. "
PCRM ARGUES SALMONELLA IS NOT FROM PEANUT BUTTER,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/pcrm-argues-salmonella-is-not-from-peanut-butter,"OCTOBER 2, 2012","The Centers for Disease Control state that 30 people in 19 states have recently been infected with salmonella, an intestinal bacterium. As of right now, the culprit seems to be Sunland Inc.’s peanut butter supply, but on his blog, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine Founder Dr. Neal Barnard reminds concerned consumers that salmonella derives from traces of animal feces, no matter how many peanut butter jars are infected. “The original source of salmonella is a farm raising chickens, cows, or other animals. And peanuts are an innocent bystander,” he says. Just like E.Coli, salmonella is spread through cross-contamination, typically by means of unsanitary food and animal handling. "
TOP 10 VEGAN PRODUCTS AT NATURAL PRODUCTS EXPO EAST,https://vegnews.com/2012/10/top-10-vegan-products-at-natural-products-expo-east,"OCTOBER 2, 2012","Every year in March, the entire VegNews staff descends on Anaheim, CA (home of Disneyland) for Expo West—the world’s largest convention for natural foods. The show is enormous—60,000 attendees and 3,000 exhibitors—and it takes our entire team three full days to hunt down the most innovative and exciting new vegan products to share with VN readers. But every September, there is also an East Coast version of the event (this year we were in Baltimore)—it’s smaller and not quite as daunting, but there are still plenty of veg treasures to be found. With my two trusty colleagues in tow (both Lara and Carol can spot a great vegan product from 20 feet away), I give you my top 10 vegan products of Expo East. And remember, these products may not hit store shelves for another three months; these shows offer an exclusive opportunity to unveil a new product long before it ever hits the market. Organic Culinary Spreads from Earth Balance
Is there a vegan alive today who hasn’t bought a tub of Earth Balance? Well, the company just kicked it up a notch with two flavored buttery spreads: Sweet Cinnamon and Roasted Garlic & Herbs. Bagels and popcorn, you’ve been warned. Thumbs Up Bars by Go Max Go Foods
Our friends at Go Max Go Foods have done it again, this time creating a vegan version of what may be the best candy bar ever: The Butterfinger. First, there were the renditions of Snickers (Jokerz), Milky Way (Twilight), Almond Joy (Mahalo), and 3 Musketeers (Buccaneer); then came their version of Nestle Crunch (Snap!) and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups (Cleo’s). My life is complete. Vegan Elixir by Tumeric
While at a spa in Bali for the VegNews Dream Island Getaway, I was served a delicious tonic made with freshly grated turmeric root, tamarind, and lime. As I sipped from my chilled ceramic cup, that moment felt like a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Enter Expo East 2012, where I stumble upon this refreshing elixir that transported me right back to the beaches of Bali. Tumeric’s Vegan Elixir is made with ginger, cardamom, spearmint, agave, lemon, sea salt, cayenne, cinnamon, and, of course, turmeric. Veggie Burgers by Hilary’s Eat Well
I know, veggie burgers have been around forever, but Hilary’s are special. Completely allergen-free, Hilary’s burgers are made with whole grains, vegetables, coconut oil, and spices—and are downright delicious. And the eco-friendly packaging (two burgers tucked into a biodegradable bag) makes these burgers a must-buy. Strawberry Cream Cheese from Galaxy Foods
I wasn’t expecting to love this new strawberry-flavored vegan cream cheese, but fall in love I did. The smooth, creamy blend had the perfect strawberry flavor (not too strong, no artificial after-taste), and with Heather Goldberg and Jenny Engel of Spork Foods hired on as Galaxy’s official brand ambassadors, what’s not to adore? Ginger Kombucha by Reed’s
Full disclosure: I can’t stand kombucha. Although several VN staffers are known to down a bottle a day, I can’t stomach the smell, taste, and idea of it. Enter Reed’s (makers of an excellent ginger brew), who have totally transformed this beverage. In flavors like Lemon Ginger Raspberry and Hibiscus Ginger Grapefruit, the team at Reeds use organic oolong and yerba mate teas as the kombucha base and have a lengthy culturing process that results in one (admittedly) very fine drink. Bamboo Toilet Paper by Bum Boosa
I am fascinated with this toilet paper—is there anything that can’t be made from bamboo? BPA-free (regular recycled TP is not) and just $1.25 a roll, this is a green alternative you can feel good about. Bamboo is the fastest-growing grass on the planet (it can grow up to three feet a day) and doesn’t require significant water or replanting after harvesting. Raw Chocolate by Cloud 9
I experienced the wonder that is Cloud 9 at an after-hours rooftop party at Baltimore’s Inn at the Black Olive. Master chocolatier Helene Leeds lived in Switzerland for 10 years and was inspired to create her own chocolate using time-honored Swiss techniques. Using ingredients like organic cacao beans, coconut butter, agave, sea salt, and vanilla, her chocolate is rich and decadent. The Walnut Raw Chocolate Fudge is life-changing. Dairy-Free Frozen Delight from WayFare
So I haven’t actually tried the new oat-based ice cream from the people behind We Can’t Say It’s Cheese. But some of my vegan friends at the show did, and they became instant converts (who needs soy/coconut/almond/hemp when you have oats?). The Vanilla Crème got the highest marks, and the super-clean ingredient list can’t be beat. Body Butters by The Orange Owl
Natural body care, especially those made with African botanicals (apparently, Africa grows one-third of the earth’s plants), were all the rage at Expo East. Out are parabens, petroleum products, and sulfates; today’s new generation of body care feature essential oils, coconut butter, and fruit extracts. I couldn’t get enough of the sumptuous Lemon Twist body butter from The Orange Owl, crafted from jojoba oil, mango butter, grapefruit seed extract, cornstarch, and lemon oil. If we care about making healthy food choices, it’s just as vital to use skin products that are free of nasty chemicals and preservatives.

Researchers have yet to find antioxidant supplements to aid in decreasing heart attack risk, but the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods has proven to be quite effective. Some vegan foods rich in antioxidants include berries, beans, artichokes, spinach, broccoli, and sweet potato, not to mention coffee, green tea, and other herbs. "

In an interview with the animal-rights organization, the actress and star of The Big Bang Theory discussed her motivation behind the ad, noting her belief in having a “young Mom face” for veganism, and that a plant-based lifestyle is compatible with being a good parent and raising healthy kids. Bailik also revealed that reading Jonathan Safran Foer’s Eating Animals gave her the education, confidence, and conviction to draw the line at what to remove from her diet and life, and added that she no longer suffers from sinus infections after eliminating dairy from her diet.

The annual event, which was founded by the North American Vegetarian Society, aims to draw awareness to the health, animal-saving, and environmental benefits of a plant-based diet. Vegan and vegetarian lifestyles have garnered much attention in recent years, with an increasing number of recognizable names adopting the diet, including celebrities such as Ben Stiller, Rosie O’Donnell, and Dax Shepard, and athletes such as Texans running back Arian Foster and tennis champion Venus Williams. Additionally, many leading scientists have recommended the diet for its climate-saving properties, with the Stockholm International Water Institute recently revealing the world’s population may need to switch almost exclusively to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid massive food shortages.

STEVE KING,https://vegnews.com/2012/9/hslf-launches-commercial-opposing-con-steve-king,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2012","On September 28, the Humane Society Legislative Fund launched a television ad opposing Iowa 4th Congressional District incumbent Steve King’s reelection to congress. The Congressman, who was previously mocked by comedian Stephen Colbert for his comments about dog fighting, is under fire in the new commercial for his contradictory voting record. King, despite claiming he is opposed to animal cruelty, voted against including pets in disaster plans, harsher penalties for dog fighting, and a federal ban on bringing children to dog fights. HSLF’s original commercial was rejected by local TV stations under pressure from King, but the Des Moines Register wrote an exposé on the matter, describing the ad as “accurate” and “true.” "

Writer Amanda L. Chan consulted two nutrition experts—Amy Lanou, associate professor of health and wellness at the University of North Carolina Asheville and Los Angeles-based dietitian Vandana Sheth—to round up the “most common pitfalls,” which include undereating, omitting vitamin B12, overconsuming processed foods, limiting one’s range of foods, and ignoring bodily cravings. The experts also offer practical advice, such as to drink more water, focus on whole grains and vegetables, and consult with a doctor to customize a personal nutrition plan.  "
VEGGIE PATCH VAN LAUNCHES IN SYDNEY,https://vegnews.com/2012/9/veggie-patch-van-launches-in-sydney,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2012","Sydney, Australia, recently began a one-year trial for food trucks in hopes of making restaurant-quality food available at street locations, and the city’s new Veggie Patch van is answering the call of hungry vegans and vegetarians. The maiden voyage was September 27, fulfilling founder Karl Kooney’s vision of bringing healthy veg food to the masses while promoting local growers, and setting an example for sustainable living and eating. The van, which is aptly named “Spud” has been converted into a green machine from an old Winnebago, running on solar power and vegetable oil while it serves up tasty seasonal fare such as herbed falafel burger, raw pumpkin pesto pasta, and organic lemonade.

Smith promotes the new Leaping Bunny-certified line—which includes shampoo, conditioner, and styling gel—as “tested on film stars, not on animals,” and Imbruglia tells Yahoo! Lifestyle that she was one of the proverbial guinea pigs for the serums. Smith also tells the website, “A lot of people still test on animals, and to be in 2012 [or 2013] it is absolutely inhumane to be doing that …  I wanted to be brave and really do something different.” The launch party, held at Sketch in London, featured a vegetarian menu with dishes such as “croquet” monsieurs and chilled tomato gazpacho.

In a recent conversation with Playboy, Shepard was asked for his take on longtime vegan Beau Bridges, his costar in Hit & Run. Shepard admitted that Bridges inspired him to give veganism a go after noticing how youthful he appeared despite being in his 70s. After seeing Forks Over Knives, Shepard decided to commit himself to the vegan lifestyle. “It’s nothing like the pill in The Matrix but damn good … I sleep 15-percent better. My allergies are 15-percent better,” he says. Shepard, whose fiancé Kristen Bell is also vegan, has also noticed clearer skin since making the switch to a plant-based diet. "

Bloomberg aims to rid the city’s hospitals of sugar and fatty foods such as fried chicken. In prior years, 15 NYC public hospitals reduced the caloric content in patients’ meals in addition to cutting down on the amount of junk food sold in vending machines, but Bloomberg wants to take it a step further, in an effort to make residents, specifically hospital patients and staff, healthier. Bloomberg’s vision will include eliminating deep fryers and making sure leafy salads are available in abundance in all cafeterias. "

The Los Angeles resident, who has avoided animal products for the last 24 years, says that now, “carnivores seem pretty happy to go to a vegetarian restaurant” because veganism is much more prevalent and understood than it used to be. The musician also notes that beyond the evolution of veganism in American society, a plant-based diet may be the reason why his meat- and dairy-free friends look 10 years younger than they actually are.

Forgacs further explained the reason for the focus on clothing was due to the product’s simpler structure, which is easier to replicate than meat, but notes, “if you look at the resource intensity of everything that goes into a hamburger, it is an environmental train wreck.” Modern Meadow is pushing for consumer acceptance, but knows with only 40 percent of consumers willing to try cultured meat, the venture is not without challenges.

In his recent public service announcement, Affleck discusses the graphic mutilation of dairy cows getting their horns removed and burned from their heads. This routine procedure performed at dairy farms involves no form of painkillers for the cow undergoing the procedure. The animal-friendly actor describes the grief that cows experience from this process and reveals that they are “thrashing, tossing their heads, rearing up, switching their tails, bellowing, and collapsing to the ground....” Affleck recommends others to exchange dairy foods and drinks for plant-based alternatives to help end cow dehorning.

Gervais joined his dog Barney in a video as the new face of the World Society for the Protection of Animals’ Red Collar Campaign. The WSPA’s program offers an alternative to the cruel slaughters by vaccinating dogs and outfitting them with red collars to show they have been vaccinated. “Mass vaccinations are the only proven solution for controlling rabies in both dogs and humans,” says Gervais.

The group tested 59 samples of foil-pouched and canned tuna from 11 different states for mercury levels and found that some samples were dangerously high. Fish is touted by representatives from the National Fisheries Institute for its omega-3 fatty acids, but a growing body of research indicates that popular species might be contaminated with carcinogens. While tuna may not be the most popular item on school lunch menus, The Mercury Project sees the risks as too great to not make changes. Some plant-based sources of omega-3s include flax, hemp, and chia seeds. "

Colin Campbell, professor at Cornell University and author of The China Study to face off against Dr. Nancy Rodriguez, professor at the University of Connecticut, in a plant-based versus animal-based diet debate. Campbell cited human populations with heart disease and cancer were strongly associated with animal-based diets, revealed the damaging effects of casein and links between dairy and bone health, expressed concern over the US Department of Agriculture’s ties to the meat industry, and shared the pain-relieving benefits of plant-based eating, noting a plant-based lifestyle can reverse 70 to 80 percent of symptomatic disease. Rodriguez countered with concerns over a lack of nutrients, endorsed the USDA as a reliable source, disregarded Campbell’s casein claims, and refuted any evidence of animal protein being linked to cancer. In April, The New York Times hosted a similar discussion on a vegan diet in its “Room for Debate” column. "
AMERICANS MIGHT BECOME HEAVIER AND SICKER BY 2030,https://vegnews.com/2012/9/americans-might-become-heavier-and-sicker-by-2030,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2012","A report released last week by The Trust for America’s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, entitled “F as in Fat: How Obesity Threatens America’s Future,” revealed that by 2030, most Americans could be diagnosed with obesity amongst many other health complications such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. This alone could cost the US up to $66 billion in healthcare and upwards of $500 billion due to deficient economic productivity. While the report seems grim, researchers say Americans can change this outcome through lifestyle and diet adjustments. If states were to lower their average Body Mass Index by just five-percent by 2030, suggests the report, the nation would be well on its way toward reducing obesity rates. Recently, a new study announced that successful long-term weight management was due largely in part to a wholesome plant-based diet. "

WHY THE WORD “VEGAN” IS MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER,https://vegnews.com/2012/9/why-the-word-vegan-is-more-powerful-than-ever,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2012","It wasn’t long ago that the word “vegan” evoked images of emaciated hippies, angry activists, and starving dumpster divers in the mainstream lexicon. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with a lean physique, being passionate about a cause, and saving perfectly good food from going to waste, but in the past five years, something has changed. Perhaps the shift occurred when Ellen DeGeneres announced to the world that she was thriving on a vegan diet, or when the pro-veg film Forks Over Knives swept the nation with its sound science and promise that diseases like diabetes and obesity could be cured with a plant-based diet. Or was it the CNN interview with Bill Clinton where he extols the virtues of living without meat and dairy, the exposure to delectable vegan food through the hundreds of meat-free cookbooks now published every year, or the constant barrage of undercover factory-farm footage on major television networks? However the change took place, the perception of veganism is more positive than ever before, and everyone from Anderson Cooper to Arian Foster are talking about it. It is nearly impossible to deny that veganism’s moment has arrived. According to the latest “how many vegetarians are there?” poll by the Vegetarian Resource Group, roughly 7.5 percent of the population identifies as either vegan or vegetarian, and an astonishing 33 percent eat “mostly veg.” Combine that with the millions more allured by the health benefits of ditching dairy and beef for almond milk and veggie burgers—not to mention the unprecendented 12-percent nose dive in meat consumption over the past five years—and we’ve got ourselves a little vegetarian revolution. The Power of Vegan
Remember that scary word, vegan? For years, marketers were told to stay clear of using it on product packaging and promotion. It was seen as a turn-off to consumers, and a surefire way to get buyers not to buy a product. But now that it’s 2012, and vegan everything practically grows on trees, I wanted to find out just how far we’ve come. Are companies finally embracing the once-forbidden label? For Seth Tibbott, founder of Turtle Island Foods (a 32-year-old vegan company that makes veggie dogs, sausages, deli slices, and the famous Tofurky), the answer is an emphatic “yes.” He says, “We showcase the term ‘vegan’ as a major point of differentiation from our main competitors. This makes it easier on current vegans, interesting to meat reducers, and intriguing for others.” Earth Balance, an all-vegan food company that produces everything from butter spreads and soymilk to nut butters and mayonnaise, has prominently marketed its products as vegan since the company’s inception in 1998. Marketing Manager Adriane Little emphasizes the importance of communicating this message to consumers as “a way to show that a vegan diet should not be restrictive, but the opposite—a lifestyle filled with good-tasting, good-for-you options.” But what about non-vegetarian companies? Have they recognized the benefits of marketing their brands as vegan? In my own analysis (spending a day at a natural-food store photographing any product that used the word vegan on its packaging), never before have I seen such a broad use of the once-taboo term. The word is splashed across boxes of Boca burgers (now owned by Kraft); popular pasta-sauce purveyor Victoria Fine Foods has launched an all-vegan line called Victoria Vegan; and Dr. Praeger’s—whose product line also includes seafood—doesn’t hold back when touting vegan on the front of its packaging. Combine this trend with such recent news as Subway testing vegan sandwiches in Washington, DC stores and McDonald’s opening its first all-vegetarian restaurant in India, and it’s just a matter of time, I believe, before major food brands embrace the word vegan to represent health, sustainability, and authenticity. For vegans, these values are nothing new, and according to Tibbott, we’re just ahead of the curve. “Vegans are ahead of their time in terms of eating a diet that we feel will be adopted by more and more people in the coming years. By living their values, they inspire others to consider dietary changes.” I couldn’t agree more.

As vegetarianism and veganism have become more mainstream, many restaurants have revamped their menus to include plant-based dishes to suit all guests’ needs. In keeping up with the increasingly high demand for fine vegetarian fare, restaurants have found that serving meat-free dishes has actually increased profits, because produce is less expensive than most animal products.

WHY US MEAT CONSUMPTION IS FALLING,https://vegnews.com/2012/9/why-us-meat-consumption-is-falling,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2012","“Kings of the Carnivores.” That’s what The Economist called Americans in April when looking at global per capita meat consumption. Only Luxembourg eats more meat. Indeed, nearly every year since World War II, as America’s population has increased, so has the number of animals we raise and kill for food. The amount of meat we eat per person has also steadily increased throughout much of our history, and with that increase, more farm animals have been taken off the land and forced to live in factories. To put it mildly, it hasn’t exactly been a good half-century for farm animals. That is until the last five years, when American meat consumption began to take a nose dive—an unprecedented 12.2 percent drop, to be precise. During that same time period, the US population grew by millions, yet because of this drop in per capita meat consumption, we’ve been raising and killing several hundred million fewer farm animals each year, amounting to billions of fewer animals enduring inhumane factory farming practices than would be expected given historical trends. What’s Driving the Trend?
We needn’t wonder about the cause of this drastic drop, since we can ask the experts themselves. CME Group—one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges and owner of the Dow Jones Index—issued its own analysis. CME points to increased feed costs, which raise the price of animal products, and revealingly, they also note: “Add in the efforts of a large number of non-governmental agencies that oppose meat consumption for reasons ranging from the environment to animal rights to social justice and one could conclude that it was amazing that consumption held up as long as it did.” Exactly. People are choosing to eat fewer animals, and not just to save money—although that’s a compelling reason. The signs to support this idea are all around us. A Kansas State Study concluded that animal protection campaigns have tangibly reduced demand for poultry and pork; a Nation’s Restaurant News cover feature titled, “Veggie-heavy brands see growth in sales, popularity with consumers,” touted the growth in meat-free eating; and a global food-industry consulting service made clear that the campaigns about the problems of mass meat production are “impacting consumer markets.” A USA Today article from March summed it up: “Whether due to rising prices, concern for the environment, or a growing emphasis on health, Americans are eating less meat.” The pressure is being felt all over, and for the first time in decades, our overconsumption of meat is beginning to get reined in. The Big Surprise
Interestingly, the numbers and headlines aren’t being driven by an influx of new vegetarians and vegans. Last year, a national poll found that the number of vegetarians in America remained at about 5 percent. But the same poll found that a whopping 16 percent of people now eat vegetarian more than half time. In other words, take 50 million people and put them on a so-called “flexitarian” diet, and the shrinking figures for meat consumption start making sense. Put another way, while Americans may not exactly be turning to vegetarianism in droves, tens of millions of people are deciding that the American diet need not be so heavy in animal products. And anyone concerned about animal suffering, the planet, or public health should be able to agree that’s a good thing. While this decline in meat consumption has helped to reduce the number of animals raised for food, a drive for better treatment of farm animals has also been increasingly successful during this same period. In fact, while 10 years ago no state had banned any standard factory-farming practice over animal-welfare concerns, today nine states have passed laws to prohibit practices such as confining pigs, calves, and chickens in tiny cages, cutting off dairy cows’ tails, and force-feeding ducks for foie gras. And an increasing number of major retailers are also demanding improved treatment of farm animals by their suppliers. Important Steps Forward
Just a few years ago, it seemed inevitable that the United States would retain its place as the king of carnivores. A sharp drop in meat consumption would have seemed impossible to virtually any reasonable onlooker. And yet it was Nelson Mandela who declared, “it always seems impossible—until it’s done.” But we shouldn’t forget that these trends aren’t self-executing. They’re occurring for an array of reasons, including the work of so many thousands of animal, health, and environmental advocates who keep making the case for a more humane and sustainable diet. Billions of animals have been spared the misery of factory farms in part due to their efforts—an historic accomplishment, for sure. The longest journeys begin with single steps, and of course the animal-protection movement still has a long way to go. But we’ve taken many important steps in recent years, steps few would have imagined possible just five years ago. As the late animal activist Henry Spira liked to say, it’s up to us to keep pushing the peanut forward. Paul Shapiro is the vice president of farm animal protection at the Humane Society of the United States. You can follow him on Twitter at @pshapiro. "

After the former president spoke at the Democratic National Convention last Wednesday, viewers were full of compliments on Clinton’s appearance. Actress Olivia Wilde tweeted that she considered Clinton a “#veganfox,” while Anderson Cooper called Clinton’s appearance “a good testament to a vegan diet,” and admitted feeling inspired to omit animal products from his diet. While Clinton is clearly reaping the benefits of a largely plant-based diet, the former president concedes that he eats fish sparingly. The dairy-free pescetarian may not be totally vegan, but his promotion of a plant-based diet appears to be motivating people nationwide to reduce their consumption of animals and animal by-products.

FOOD SHORTAGES COULD RESULT IN MORE VEGETARIANS,https://vegnews.com/2012/8/food-shortages-could-result-in-more-vegetarians,"AUGUST 27, 2012","According to leading scientists at the Stockholm International Water Institute, the world’s population may need to switch almost exclusively to a vegetarian diet over the next 40 years to avoid massive food shortages. The proposed diet change has to do with lack of water available to croplands and population growth—the world population will likely reach 9 billion by the year 2050. The scientists pointed out that animal-protein diets require five to 10 times more water than a plant-based diet, as one third of the world’s land is used to grow crops used for animal feed, and 900 million people are currently hungry despite a continuous rise in per capita food production. International relief organization Oxfam, which recently endorsed Meatless Mondays, forecasts that food price spikes will have a devastating affect on countries that are reliant on food imports. "

The appeal follows recently released hidden-camera footage shot at Walmart supplier Christensen Farms’ Minnesota facility by a MFA undercover investigator, revealing pregnant sows locked in the confining crates, unable to turn around or walk, pigs suffering multiple injuries, and workers brutally killing piglets by slamming them headfirst into the concrete. The letter strongly states, “As the largest retailer in the world, Walmart has the power … to ensure [its] pork … is not the product of egregious animal abuse.” Photo via mercyforanimals.org "

While Campbell’s has set a 2022 deadline as the definitive date to complete the transition, the business hopes to have made significant progress as soon as 2017. Campbell’s follows in the footsteps of more than 20 companies to eradicate the use of the confining crates, including Costco, Sysco, and McDonald’s. Animal-welfare organizations such as Mercy For Animals are encouraging other food distributors such as Walmart and Target to follow suit. Walmart has come under recent scrutiny after a MFA undercover investigation displayed abuse of sows at one of the chain’s suppliers. "

In 2011, the US Department of Agriculture purchased 21 million pounds of beef from the meat-production facility, which was sent to schools, Native American reservations, and community food banks. After the breaking news earlier this week regarding the undercover footage, institutions nationwide, including the American Meat Institute and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association have been voicing discontent, referring to the actions of Central Valley employees as disgraceful and abusive.

BANANA PRESERVATIVE SPRAY MADE FROM SHELLFISH,https://vegnews.com/2012/8/banana-preservative-spray-made-from-shellfish,"AUGUST 23, 2012","On Wednesday, scientists at the National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society disclosed information about a banana coating that can keep the fruit from ripening too quickly, which leads to rotting. Unfortunately, the preservative coating is made from shrimp and crab shells, due to a shellfish-derived by-product that works to kill off the bacterium that causes bananas to decompose. Scientists involved in the study say that coating bananas in the spray allows them to stay fully fresh for up to 12 days. Organic bananas will remain unaffected by this development. "

The pilot program “Healthy U Picks,” which will continue through the fall, lowers the prices of healthy foods while raising the prices of unhealthy choices after a survey conducted last year revealed that cost was a main factor for patients, visitors, and staff when choosing something to eat. As a result, the veggie burger now costs 25 cents less than its animal-based equivalent, leading to a sell-out of the plant-based option. “We had a significant difference in how many people got veggie burgers compared to hamburgers; we even ran out of the veggie burgers, which is a good problem,” said MCR Food Director Robyn Smith Brown.

The bill would make it against the law to allow a dog to pursue a bear or bobcat at any time, with few exceptions. According to the ASPCA, a 2011 Mason-Dixon poll indicated 83 percent of Californians oppose bear hounding, and less than one percent of state residents hunt. Only 18 of 50 states still allow hounding practices, although hunting-heavy states such as Pennsylvania and Montana have already banned the practice. "
CENTRAL VALLEY BEEF MAY BE UNFIT FOR CONSUMPTION,https://vegnews.com/2012/8/central-valley-beef-may-be-unfit-for-consumption,"AUGUST 21, 2012","Central Valley Meat Co., which was shut down by the US Department of Agriculture after Compassion Over Killing released undercover footage, is now under investigation, and the USDA is currently assessing the wellness level of the cows on site. If the mistreated cows were also sick, their meat would be declared inedible for human consumption. The video footage shows cows unable to walk, or even stand up properly; the USDA’s main concern is to determine the state of health the slaughtered cows were in. After learning about the slaughterhouse’s handling practices and treatment of cows, In-N-Out Burger ended business with Central Valley, citing the fast food company does not work with suppliers with inhumane tactics.

The study found that men who consume more than 1.5 servings of pan-fried red meat each week are 30 percent more likely to develop prostate cancer than men who seldom eat pan-fried red meat. Associate professor of preventative medicine at USC and head of the study, Mariana Stern says, “We speculate that these findings are a result of different levels of carcinogen accumulation found in hamburgers, given that they can attain higher internal and external temperatures faster than steak.” While Stern hypothesizes carcinogen levels to be the culprit behind increased prostate cancer development, plant-based diets have been found in a multitude of other studies to dramatically lower the risk of developing cancer.

While the proposal aims to address consumer concerns about animal-welfare standards, farmers are rejecting the idea, citing lack of context, marketing-driven cynicism, and invasion of privacy. Animal-rights group Animals Australia responded with a statement saying, “Abattoirs and producers who are confident they can meet community expectations should welcome such an initiative; it would reassure consumers that retailers were taking community concerns about animal-welfare seriously.” "

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack hopes that the purchases will “help mitigate further downward prices,” and Obama cites current “tough times” as the reasoning behind the purchase, disclosing that much of the meat will be frozen for later use. The price of corn, which is widely used as livestock feed, has risen by nearly 23 percent due to the water shortage. National Geographic suggests eating less meat and dairy as a means of water conservation due to the environmental inefficiency of livestock production. "
WIDESPREAD DROUGHT IN US AFFECTS FOOD SUPPLY,https://vegnews.com/2012/8/widespread-drought-in-us-affects-food-supply,"AUGUST 19, 2012","Although this summer’s drought has devastated many crops, it has also deepened the flavors in select produce. Peppers such as jalapeños, onions, and garlic have become more potent due to the conditions. In dry heat, water concentration is lowered in fruit and vegetables allowing produce to sweeten up or richen in flavor. Regardless, rain is needed to keep crops alive and at an affordable price. For consumers concerned about inflated grocery bills due to the drought, writer Heather Moore suggests that veganism is the cheapest and most sustainable diet. "

Three horses collapsed on city streets (two later died) over the course of only six weeks in late 2011, and on Thursday, a six-year-old horse named Oreo collided with a moving vehicle near Central Park. The frightened animal broke free of its carriage and galloped up Broadway, endangering itself and citizens and sparking alarm about the true risks of the tourism-driven industry. Advocacy group New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets responded to the incident by pressing for a solution to the ongoing issue, suggesting that the horse carriages be replaced with eco-friendly vintage replica automobiles.

The study measured the carotid wall thickness of 1,231 patients, and also required each patient to disclose personal information about their health including their consumption of egg yolks and whether or not they smoke. “We believe our study makes it imperative to reassess the role of egg yolks, and dietary cholesterol in general, as a risk factor for coronary heart disease,” the researchers confirm. The National Heart Blood and Lung Institute advises Americans to consume no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day; one egg yolk has more than 200 milligrams. "

Animal-rights activists are praising the move. “This legislation may yet save millions of animals. Israel may well become the first country to ban fur sales nationwide,” said Jane Halevy, executive director and founder of the International Anti-Fur Coalition. The bill implores that fur is not a necessity item, but simply a fashion item or status symbol to which there are many suitable synthetic alternatives. While Israel would be the first country to ban the sale of fur nationwide, some cities across the globe have already adopted anti-fur stances, including Dublin and Fingal in Ireland, and West Hollywood in California.

This fall, schools across the country will serve healthier foods to students, due to a new law requiring cafeteria food to meet certain nutritional standards. Schools are being asked to provide students with a larger variety of fruit and vegetables, more whole grains, and foods with minimal amounts of sodium, and schools that do not meet the criteria will not be compensated for federal food expenses. Some dishes that schools have been testing out with students include spicy black-bean vegetarian wraps, sweet potato salad, and spinach lasagna. This is the first time in 15 years that the government has called for a nutritional revamp in school cafeterias. "

The fox dug underneath a fence, while the boar broke a barricade, allowing marsupials Jack, Mick, and Skippy to hop nine miles to freedom until spotted by an onlooker. “They’re not aggressive at all. We were worried they might get run over,” said the zoo’s Deputy Manager Michael Hoffmann, who further speculated that the break-out likely had to do with the fact that young foxes in the area are searching out food. “And wild boars try to get in here too because they can dig around our meadows and don’t have to worry about getting shot,” added Hoffmann. The kangaroo trio have since been apprehended by officials. "

The situation means not only record-high prices for soy, corn, hay, and other feed ingredients, but for the prices of animal products as well. Dr. Scott Brown, agriculture economist at the University of Missouri, forecasts an eight percent increase in the prices of meat, dairy, and poultry in 2013 and possibly even 2014 due to the drought. Meteorologists are predicting an onslaught of rain and cooler temperatures to arrive late-August, which wil turn up too late for farm animals scheduled to be destroyed immediately by producers who can’t afford the costs of feed.

Us too! Not only do we like to drool over the thought of vegan food across the country, but we also like to compare and contrast our own healthy strides, guilty pleasures, and off-the-cuff snacks with fellow folks of the plant-based persuasion. For our new 48 Hours in Vegan Eating series, we’ll follow some of our favorite figureheads on their daily compassionate culinary adventures. We decided to start with Isa Chandra Moskowitz of The Post-Punk Kitchen, supposing that she would have an enviable array of meals, snacks, and treats to read (and fantasize) about, and we weren’t disappointed. Wednesday, August 1, 2012 Breakfast: It’s my first day in Portland (visiting from my home base of Omaha, NE) so I had to go out for the Country Comfort breakfast at Vita Café. That’s scrambled tofu (they also offer tempeh, if you prefer), a biscuit with gravy, potatoes, and steamed veggies. Lunch: Breakfast was big, so I didn’t have a full lunch … although I may or may not have stepped into Back to Eden for a piece of peanut butter fudge at some point. (Full disclosure: I was housesitting for the owners of the bakery, taking care of their kitties and pup!) Dinner: Some friends and I sat at the Portobello bar and shared about a million plates. Among them were the Watermelon Salad, which completely converted me to the melon-salad world. Of course we had to have Portobello’s famous Pan-Crisped Potato Gnocchi, which was tossed with summer veggies: corn, orange pear tomatoes, and summer squashes. Even though bartender Lauren knows everything about wine and uses words like “mineral-y,” we opted for mixed drinks to wash it all down. Blueberry gimlets for all! Thursday, August 2, 2012 Breakfast: I’m not usually a sweet breakfast person, but when in Portland! I enjoyed my favorite cinnamon bun in the world at Dovetail bakery, accompanied by some strong coffee. Lunch: For lunch I met Vida Vegan Con organizer Jess of Get Sconed! and we hit up the Mississippi Marketplace food carts, sampling items from local food trucks Native Bowl and Homegrown Smoker. The Couch bowl at Native Bowl, with lots of fresh veggies and owner Julie’s ridiculously addictive spicy sauce, and some Mac and No-Cheese from Homegrown were just what the afternoon doctor ordered. Dinner: After such a big lunch, I decided to skip din-din. Although, I did find myself at vegan bar The Bye & Bye close to midnight, drinking their signature drink (also called the Bye & Bye, duh!) and sharing a grilled-cheese sandwich with a buddy. I also discovered that if you order a side of the rice, beans, and greens, you can kind of stuff some of those ingredients into the grilled cheese, and it’s pretty good! But maybe only if you’re a little buzzed. Don’t miss Isa Chandra Moskowitz’s newest project, Forks Over Knives: The Cookbook, out this week!  Photo via catster.com "

The Congressman is taking heat for his vote against an amendment to the Farm Bill, which would make it a federal crime to attend or bring a child to an animal fight. In a recent online video, King said, “It is a federal crime to watch animals fight … but it’s not a crime to watch people fighting, there is something wrong with the priorities of people who think like that. It’s wrong to rate animals above human beings.” Colbert ridiculed King’s logic, sarcastically retorting, “He was savaged by the ‘we don’t enjoy watching animals being tortured for our own amusement’ brigade over at the Humane Society.” "

MEATIER THAN MEAT? MUSHROOM RECIPES THAT CAN FOOL ANYONE,https://vegnews.com/2012/8/meatier-than-meat-mushroom-recipes-that-can-fool-anyone,"AUGUST 6, 2012","Have you ever noticed how the veg option is usually something featuring mushrooms? Turns out, it’s more than flavor—it’s, quite honestly, science. There’s serious chemistry behind the “meaty” reputation of the mighty mushroom. According to chemist and New York Times columnist Harold McGee, who writes about the science behind cooking, mushrooms contain large concentrations of free amino acids including glutamatic acid. Glutamic acid, the natural source of monosodium glutamate, is aided in its mission to taste great by another chemical, guanosine monophosphate. What does this mean? It means that mushrooms are a plant-based source of the same kind of mouthfeel that animal foods deliver. The phenomenon is called umami, a Japanese word for meatiness, and is more intense when mushrooms are dried. This too, has science behind it: according to McGee, shiitake mushrooms get their appealing aroma from a chemical called lenthionine, which is created and maximized by enzymes as the mushrooms dry. That same lenthionine will be created by slow cooking, which explains the difference between deeply brown, shrunken sautéed mushrooms that my mom always served over steak. Understanding the chemistry in mushrooms is really all about one thing, and that is getting the most flavor out of them. So, take a tip from the Japanese, and start using more dried mushrooms. You may not be as enamored with eating dried mushrooms in a stir-fry, but you can always infuse a stock, sauce, or soup with them. Grinding dried mushrooms to a fine powder gives great flavor to any dish. When cooking with fresh mushrooms, slowly sauté them over low heat. They may not be pretty, but they will taste amazing, especially with a shot of tamari or wine. Bon appetit! Cook up some mushroom magic of your own:

If it were to pass, the ban of foie gras in California would not apply to the “delicacy” when it comes into the Golden State from elsewhere in the country.

BEYOND MEAT EXPECTS TO SHOCK UPON LAUNCHING,https://vegnews.com/2012/7/beyond-meat-expects-to-shock-upon-launching,"JULY 29, 2012","Beyond Meat, a new meat-alternative company, is once again in the news for its authentically chicken-like product. Biz Stone, one of Twitter’s founders, supports Beyond Meat and says that when he first tried it, he couldn’t believe that it was made from plant-based ingredients. According to taste testers, no faux-meat substitutes are as realistic as Beyond Meat. The much-hyped meat substitute recently received the praise of slate.com’s Farhad Manjoo, who revealed the strips, “… look, feel, and taste closer to real meat than any other food I’ve ever eaten.” Additionally, in his March 11 column for the New York Times, writer Mark Bittman admitted that the product had him stumped in a blind tasting. “I didn’t [know], at least, and this is the kind of thing I do for a living,” said Bittman.

Upon spotting another trap, the pair, joined by a third teenager named Tetero, took it down in an effort to protect their clan. Although the poachers have no interest in capturing gorillas, they often leave the animals ensnared in the rope-and-tree branch traps, even though mountain gorillas are an endangered species.

3 WAYS TO SHARE YOUR LOVE OF VEG FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2012/7/3-ways-to-share-your-love-of-veg-food,"JULY 16, 2012","We all love to flip through a brand new cookbook, ogling the photos and drooling over recipe titles, imagining ourselves effortlessly whipping up dish after dish with the flair and ease of Julia Child. The unfortunate truth is that sometimes we need a little extra push to make our culinary magic happen, a third-party motivational force to help chef-us be all that we can be. Luckily, it’s easier than ever to connect with other vegan foodies across the country and take your enjoyment of plant-based cuisine to the next level. With cookbook clubs, food swaps, and pen-pal clubs, you’ll be discovering all kinds of cruelty-free treats in no time. Cookbook Crazy
School may be out, but a little bit of homework from time to time never hurt anybody. If you love trying new recipes but haven’t found the occasion (or confidence) to make it happen regularly, consider joining a cookbook club. Gather your vegan, vegetarian, and veg-curious friends via blog post, email, or even an old-fashioned phone call, and set up periodical meetings to share dishes from a chosen cookbook. For example, choose a specific dish and trade tips about ways to excel in or improve upon its recipe, or meet up to share different items for a more comprehensive taste test. Not sure where to start? A lone vegan in an omni world? Consider joining an online group, such as VegCookbook Club, founded by blogger and podcast-host Britt Bravo. Each month, Bravo selects a vegetarian or vegan cookbook, and each Monday, she shares her experience in trying its recipes. The key is participation—members are encouraged to comment about their own attempts, discuss what worked (or didn’t), and promote their own recipe blogs. In addition to forming a community with other vegans and improving your cooking skills, you can share your creations with not-yet-veg friends to show them the wonders of plant-based dining! Plus, the group has a Pinterest page, a Flickr group, and an Instagram hashtag for sharing mouthwatering photos of its collective smorgasbord. Here are a few good books to start with:
Big Vegan (Robin Asbell, 2011)
Chloe’s Kitchen (Chloe Coscarelli, 2012)
Veganomicon: The Ultimate Vegan Cookbook (Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero, 2007) Smart Swaps
Longing to taste, and not just talk about, others’ cooking? Vegan food swaps multiply your noshing opportunities in a format similar to a potluck. There are numerous ways to organize your food swap event; some choose to have everyone bring dishes from a specific cookbook (similar to the aforementioned cookbook clubs, but in three dimensions!), while others, such as San Francisco’s Vegan Hacker, opt for a cooking-class environment. At Vegan Hacker’s monthly events, attendees gather with an assortment of ingredients to create original recipes with a little bit of help from expert overseers. For example, a March event provided guests with all of the ingredients and instructions for making vegan ravioli, but attendees brought their own fillings, which could be anything from veggies to dairy-free cheese to jam. Vegan Hacker has also tackled fondue, burgers, gourmet French fries, and even Twinkies! Similarly, the St. Pete Vegan Food Swap in St. Petersburg, FL, has themed swaps where attendees can share and sample all different kinds of vegan foods, cruelty-free crafts, and produce. Typically, each person brings six servings of a dish, and the group uses a drawn-number system to let every guest try six different items. As a result, everyone gets maximum bang for his or her theoretical buck (participation is free!). There are even specialty swaps, such as soup swaps, which have gained popularity due to soup’s ease of preparation and freeze-friendliness. Try websites like Facebook, swap.com, and Meetup to find vegan groups in your area that could be interested in hosting food swaps—you may even find that they’re already happening in your ‘hood. Radical PenPal
Finally, if you live discovering new vegan store-bought products from all over the country, a foodie pen pal might be your new best friend. Food blog The Lean Green Bean hosts the popular Foodie Pen Pal program to allow snack enthusiasts nationwide to share their edible discoveries. Columbus, OH-based LGB creator Lindsay Livingston designed the system to accommodate vegetarians and vegans by matching them with a similarly dieted pen pal from a database of more than 1,000 participants, which also takes into consideration allergies and overall food preferences. Once a month, participants will receive the email address of their new foodie pen pal, and will have about 10 days to compile a box of goodies for their new long-distance buddy. Finally, on the last day of the month, pen pals will post about all of their gorge-worthy gifts. There’s a monetary cap on each box’s value, so don’t worry about busting your bank account. While it works the best for bloggers (so that you can show off your bounties), it’s open to everyone in the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Glance at pen-pal posts from bloggers The Veggie Next Door and Raised By Culture, and their enviable rewards will make you want to sign up, stat. Although you might not be a maestro with your mixer, cookbook clubs, vegan food swaps, and foodie pen pals can help you discover delicious new ways to enjoy a plant-based diet. But the biggest bonus of these groups is connecting with fellow vegans who share your appetite for healthy, compassionate—and most of all, tasty—living. "

Many of the operations selected by HSUS have connections to leaders of the National Pork Producers Council, a trade group that endorses the use of gestation crates. HSUS estimates hundreds of pounds of airborne ammonia are released each day, and notes that the Environmental Protection Agency requires reporting by any facility releasing more than 100 pounds in 24 hours. “The National Pork Producers Council’s record on environmental degradation is just as sordid as its record on the systemic mistreatment of animals,” states Jonathan Lovvorn, senior vice president and chief counsel for animal protection litigation at HSUS.

The study used data collected over the course of 15 years from more than 43,000 Swedish women who were in their 30s and 40s at the beginning of the study, finding a 28 percent increase in the risk of cardiovascular conditions among those who followed the high-protein diet.

Foie gras—the engorged livers of ducks and geese, achieved through force-feeding—was outlawed in Chicago in 2006, only to have the decision reversed two years later. While animal-welfare advocates hope the California ban will endure, some are hoping to get a ban implemented nationwide. In May, several organizations filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Agriculture, alleging that foie gras violates consumer-safety laws that prohibit diseased poultry from entering the food supply.

Additionally, it is responsible for massive deforestation and methane release. The scientists encourage consumers to eat less beef, and meat in general, and to urge local grocery stores to only carry meats that are not associated with deforestation. "
VEGAN ACTORS NAMED PETA’S SEXIEST VEGETARIANS,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/vegan-actors-named-petas-sexiest-vegetarians,"JUNE 28, 2012","Actors Jessica Chastain and Woody Harrelson have been dubbed People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ Sexiest Vegetarians of 2012. The longtime vegans—Harrelson adopted a plant-based diet in his early 20s, and Chastain has been vegan for five years—join the ranks of fellow vegan celebs Olivia Wilde and Russell Brand, who received the honor in 2010 and 2011, respectively. This year has been a big year for both recipients, with Harrelson’s blockbuster flick The Hunger Games dominating the box office, and Chastain earning an Oscar nomination for her work in The Help. PETA praised the actors’ dedication to their diets, saying, “Jessica and Woody’s combined 45 years of cruelty-free eating have saved at least 4,500 animals from being neglected, genetically manipulated … and killed in gruesome and violent ways.”  "
NPR REPORTS ON HISTORY OF US MEAT CONSUMPTION,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/npr-reports-on-history-of-us-meat-consumption,"JUNE 27, 2012","This week, NPR examined the history and impact of meat consumption in the US, analyzing the economic and social factors that affect the Standard American Diet. According to the media organization, the US has the second-highest average meat consumption per capita in the world, weighing in at a whopping 270.7 pounds per person per year—168.2 pounds more than the world average. Experts partially attribute this phenomenon to the country’s high overall level of income, noting that meat consumption tends to rise as countries’ economic conditions improve. However, the reports note that the country is in the midst of a historical shift: a new study released this week says US meat consumption—particularly that of red meat—is on the decline, primarily due to Americans’ desire to eat healthier.

MY LIFE AS AN UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATOR,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/my-life-as-an-undercover-investigator,"JUNE 27, 2012","In the May+June 2012 issue of VegNews, law student Cody Carlson shared his experience working as an undercover investigator for Mercy For Animals. Readers were so moved by his first-hand account of the horrors of factory farming, and asked that we post the piece on VegNews.com so that Cody’s story can be told to even more people. The article is presented here in its entirety. Hidden cameras and recorders strapped to their bodies. Knowing that one wrong word to a co-worker will result in getting busted. Watching animals live and die in the worst conditions imaginable, and being prohibited from even expressing the most basic compassion for them. Undercover investigators exist in solitude, cut off from everyone they’ve ever known, surrounded by people who often take pleasure in torturing animals, and tasked with working grueling hours in constant peril of being exposed. Why would anyone take on this lonely, horrific task? Because covert documentation of cruelty is changing the way people think about the animals who become their food—and saving animals’ lives by the hundreds of thousands. Yet while undercover investigations are emerging as perhaps the most powerful threat to the existence of factory farming, the lives and motivations of the people who carry them out remain a mystery. These professional infiltrators have been described by many as truth-seeking journalists and compassionate activists, and by others as unscrupulous propagandists—even “animal rights terrorists.” As proposed “ag-gag” bills (state legislation that would make the documenting of factory farms without the owners’ permission illegal) threaten to further conceal the day-to-day cruelties of the industrial animal production system, it’s never been more important to understand these investigators and what it is they do. I worked undercover for two years, and this is my story. The Beginning
I was 25 years old when I began working for Mercy For Animals. Before that, I was an analyst at a private investigation agency in midtown Manhattan, where I spent most of my day mining online databases from my cubicle. At the time, I wasn’t closely involved with the animal protection movement, though I’d been vegan since reading about factory farming in my teens. Then one day, after seeing a groundbreaking story about an MFA investigation on the news, I decided that being vegan wasn’t enough. I contacted Nathan Runkle at MFA and volunteered to conduct background research for future investigations. Instead, he asked if I would like to come on board and do investigations myself. I didn’t know what to say. Like anyone, I loathe animal abuse, and wasn’t sure how I’d react to being confronted with it so intimately. What’s more, I knew going undercover would mean disappearing from my life in New York, indefinitely suspending a promising career, a relationship, and even family and friendships in order to live a tenuous, unglamorous and potentially dangerous secret life. But nagging at my conscience, I knew I was also being offered a unique opportunity to do some good. After all, the handful of undercover investigators already out there were fast becoming the driving force behind the growing animal protection movement. Their videos were leading more and more consumers to boycott factory farm products and move towards a humane, plant-based diet. Investigations were also swaying corporate policies and tipping the scales in favor of state ballot initiatives like California’s Proposition 2, thereby implementing much-needed farm-animal protection laws. In some cases, investigations were even getting facilities criminally prosecuted and shut down. I thought it over for a few weeks and talked with my dad and some trusted friends. Hovering on the fence, I made a deal: I would do one investigation. If what I uncovered on that farm indicated that my concerns were misplaced, that things really weren’t as bad as I had feared, I would go back to my normal life. But if what I found confirmed my suspicions—that the kind of egregious abuse captured in previous investigations represented more than a “few bad apples”— I would set aside my plans and dedicate myself to exposing the realities of factory farming. In the weeks that followed, I quit my job, buzzed my hair, threw my life in storage, and headed out to California to train with Pete, the prolific undercover investigator profiled in the HBO documentaries Dealing Dogs and Death on a Factory Farm. He took me around to livestock auctions, where he trained me to operate a hidden camera and showed me how to act and talk like a farmhand. When I went home, I picked up a state-of-the art hidden camera from a sympathetic military engineer in the East Village, splurged on Carhartt overalls and a toolset at K-Mart, and tuned up my pickup truck, which had been languishing in my dad’s garage since college. With a map of the region’s factory farms in my lap, I headed upstate. Before the week was over, I had landed my first job. The First Time
I responded to an online want ad. It was for a maintenance position at the biggest dairy farm in the Northeast, Willet Dairy. I applied using my real name, Social Security number, and other vital information. I told them I knew my way around an engine and was hungry for work. After a brief interview, they offered me the job, and I began my career as a factory farmer. As far as I knew, no one had gone undercover at a dairy farm before, and I wasn’t sure what to expect. Maybe, I thought, it wouldn’t be as bad as the undercover images I had seen of industrial egg, hog, and poultry farms. Maybe the worst factory farming cruelties hadn’t fully taken over dairy farming yet. But by the end of my first day, I’d realize how wrong I was. Working at that “farm,” I learned that their 5,000 cows spent every day crowded in barren, manure-filled concrete barns. They were kept perpetually pregnant through artificial insemination, and routinely pumped full of antibiotics and hormones like rBST. Further, the cows were rife with swollen joint infections where their legs rubbed against the concrete, and suffered from heavy, inflamed udders. I watched everyday as more cows collapsed at four or five years of age - a fraction of their natural lifespan - and were either left to die or shipped to slaughter. As for the many calves born as a by-product of dairy production, if they didn’t freeze to death in an unattended tin shed, they were also shipped to slaughter within days of birth. These cows were being abused, neglected, and overdriven like disposable milk-producing machines. As a maintenance worker, I mainly replaced the long steel cables that dragged v-shaped “manure scrapers” down the filthy concrete barn floors. It was hard, dangerous, and disgusting work, but my day was brightened by the cows that surrounded me to watch me work. We were each grateful for the distraction. Despite their ailments, they were affectionate, playful, and highly social. Unfortunately, my supervisor did not think as highly of them. Phil had worked at the dairy for 20 years, and was a reservoir of sadistic anecdotes. When curious cows approached us, he often attacked them mercilessly and for no reason at all, using whatever tool happened to be in his hand. When I told management about his abuse, they laughed knowingly. “He likes to get real rough with them,” one said. “Take his anger out on them.” Despite the owners’ knowledge of the way he treated the cows, Phil was never disciplined. Unfortunately, his attacks were so spontaneous and unprovoked that I was only able to catch one on film. After six weeks, I thought I had seen (and videotaped) all I needed and quit. Then I took my hours of video and written evidence to the local district attorney. It was accompanied by a 40-count criminal complaint prepared by MFA’s Director of Investigations and animal-protection nonprofit Compassion Over Killing’s legal counsel, accusing the farm of being in ongoing violation of New York’s animal cruelty statute. When the DA’s investigation stalled for several months, we brought the footage to Brian Ross’ team at ABC’s Nightline. They aired a damning—and award-winning—exposé of the dairy industry called, “Got Milk? Got Ethics?” that awakened millions of viewers to the urgent plight of modern dairy cows. The ensuing public outcry pressured the DA into taking action. Phil, my supervisor, was charged and pled guilty for his single documented act of abuse. Unfortunately, the DA decided not to press charges against the facility for following “commonly accepted commercial-farming practices,” but Willett Dairy didn’t get off scot-free. Its distributor cancelled their contract, and they were pressured to stop amputating, or “docking,” their cows’ tails. A bill was also introduced by New York Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal to ban tail-docking without anesthesia. With all these developments, it was clear that I was more useful in the field than back home. Undercover life sucked, there was no doubt about it, but at least I was good at it. And now that I had seen the truth for myself, I could either go back to my cubicle or keep telling people. I decided to stay for another case. A Vicious Cycle
That spring, I worked at a sow farm in central Pennsylvania for two months. After that, I spent a few weeks working at a pet store, learning how to eventually talk my way into about 50 puppy mills in Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. The next winter, I worked at a series of battery cage egg farms around Iowa. At each location, I found the same thing: millions of animals suffering a fate worse than death. The more I saw, the more I needed the world to recognize the weight of this injustice. I needed everyone to look into the eyes of a caged farm animal and recognize like I had that she feels the same pain, the same terror, and even the same potential joy as you or I. I watched young hiefers and piglets wrestle and prance in their small concrete and steel pens, their instinctual and immutable enthusiasm for life momentarily triumphing over their cruel environment. Once, I watched as a mother sow cleverly engineered a prison break by loosening the hinges of her crate with her tongue until the front door fell off. After escorting out her piglets, the sow immediately began to do the same for another sow’s door. My coworker told me that several sows had orchestrated such “liberations” in the past, and that these sows had to be put down. These bittersweet moments were few and far between. Mainly, I witnessed horrific scenes like mother pigs getting beaten with metal rods to force them back into farrowing crates after getting their first chance to walk in months. I watched them roar in helpless despair as their piglets were violently yanked from their teats and castrated in front of their faces. I watched countless egg-laying hens die of thirst, starvation, or trampling after their broken legs or wings became trapped in their cages. And I watched mother cows spend days bellowing for their stolen calves as if this was the first time it had happened. For me, these memories illustrate the tragedy of the modern animal farm. You need only look to see that these intelligent animals are paying an unfathomable cost to satisfy our habit for cheap meat, eggs and dairy. Of course, individual workers aren’t held responsible for these standard conditions. They are trained to ignore animal suffering, creating a work culture of apathy or even outright cruelty. Every facility had at least one person like Phil who tortured the animals for fun. These guys were troubled, and didn’t make much effort to hide it from their coworkers. The scarier part was that nobody tried to stop them, or did anything more then tease them for there sadistic behavior. This was strange since many of the workers claimed that they cared about the animals, and admitted that they had to “get used” to working in the barns. Some told me privately about their frequent nightmares or their chronic health problems. Most had applications on file with the other employer down the road, but for now, they were stuck here. In response, they had to become desensitized just to make it through the day.  Since I was a new employee, I figured it was all right for me to show some concern. I risked blowing my cover by complaining about cruel treatment to management at every facility, and every time, they told me it was just something I had to put up with. Eventually, I learned to just keep my mouth shut. Speaking up, I’d learn, could only get you in trouble. Once, a co-worker at a battery egg farm confronted me about my concern for the hens who were suffering from prolapsed uteri (a condition in which the birds’ uteri are partially expelled from their bodies, and unable to be retracted). These herniated organs were getting tangled in the cages, causing an agonizingly slow death, and I had asked whether we were expected to provide veterinary care. In no uncertain terms, the worker accused me of being an undercover investigator. With my heart beating in my throat, I feigned annoyance, and told her to leave me alone and let me do my job. From then on, I only helped animals when no one was watching. As a vegan and an animal lover, it was almost impossible to remain passive in the face of such cruelty, but that’s exactly what my job required. My code was simple: don’t do anything illegal, or anything that would otherwise compromise my credibility as a witness down the road. Otherwise, I did exactly what was expected of me. I was a model employee. As I worked, I reminded myself that this abuse was going to happen regardless of my presence, but would be documented if I stuck around by playing along. Capturing the abuse on film began to give me an adrenaline rush, and I focused on that feeling instead. Still, the experience was draining me. I was losing weight, sleeping fitfully, and forgetting how to interact with others socially. My old life in New York had all but faded away, while my new life – a life of solitude and constant horrors – remained a secret to everyone I had left behind. It was like I no longer existed. After two years, I couldn’t do it anymore. Nathan and Pete completely understood when I told them I was through. Getting Out
My timing ended up being perfect. A month after I retired, trade groups for the puppy mill and factory farming industries sent out bulletins to their members, warning them to be on the lookout for undercover investigators and providing them with my name and description. They had blown my cover, but MFA was one step ahead. Pete had trained a new investigator who was already working in the field. In the following months, as new investigations continued to mount, industry groups realized they would need more than a post-hoc response. In the fall of 2010, four states introduced bills that would make undercover investigations illegal. In some cases, these bills attached liability not just to investigators, but ostensibly to anyone who shared their video on Facebook or Twitter. Ag-friendly legislators offered an array of outlandish justifications—everything from protecting food safety to preventing trespassing meth addicts from stealing anhydrous ammonia—but their real intent was obvious. In each state, the bills were drafted and lobbied for by factory farmers with the clear expectation of silencing whistle-blowers. Fortunately, their plan quickly backfired. Prominent media outlets rightly perceived these bills as an assault on journalistic freedoms. They took up our cause, telling millions of Americans about agribusiness’s dirty war on the truth, until all four bills ultimately stalled at the end of the legislative session. This year, seven states have re-introduced ag-gag bills. With consumers increasingly choosing cruelty-free alternatives and major reforms looming for the egg and pork sector, it seems like the ag-gag laws are animal agribusiness’s last hope to stem the tides of change. It’s just one part of an ongoing struggle to decide how much the public should know about where our food comes from, and what we should do about it. As for me, I’ve stepped back from the front lines, but more and more people are stepping up. New investigators are continuing to give a platform to the 9 billion animals suffering on America’s factory farms. I’m proud to count a few of them as my friends, and can testify that they are some of the kindest, bravest, and most dedicated folks I’ve ever met. No one is better equipped for the challenges they are certain to face. I hope you’ll support them by sharing their videos every way you can, helping out groups like Mercy For Animals, the HSUS, and Compassion Over Killing, contacting your representatives when called upon, and of course, by continuing to boycott animal agribusiness. In return, they’ll keep working tirelessly to hold agribusiness accountable, one “bad apple” at a time. A Day in the Life: 24 Hours as an Investigator
Here’s what a single day working as an undercover investigator entailed while Cody worked at Country View Family Farms in Middletown, PA. 5am Woke up, got dressed in my street clothes, and set up my wire. Drove to the Sheetz gas station to pick up a coffee and a newspaper, and took my first covert recording of the day: a quick shot of the paper’s front page, which serves to time stamp the day’s footage. 
6am Pulled into the driveway and punched in to work. Took a shower to “decontaminate” myself from the outside world and put on a sanitized uniform. I scooped out rations of corn and soy meal to about 100 sows in the farrowing barns. As my job required, I used this time to prod the sows to get them to stand up, so that they do not become lame from lying in one place all day.
7am Administered shots of tetracycline and other steroids to several dozen sows and pigs that were flagged as sick. Removed all the piglets that died since yesterday, and marked the cause of death on the daily tally. Most were “laid ons”—they had been crushed under their immobilized mothers.
8am Watched my co-workers tail-dock and castrate about 300 newborn piglets. I injected each pig with iron so that the wounds do not become infected. My co-workers never changed their blades, so that by the end they were jagged and dull. A couple of the pigs immediately ruptured—their organs spilled out of the incision—and they were carried by one leg to the “death cart” to be gassed.
9am Joined my supervisor to walk along the farrowing barns and identify young pigs that weren’t growing fast enough. She bumped some back into younger age groups to give them a few more weeks to grow. Others she simply threw in the “death cart,” a mobile bin that suffocates pigs with CO2. It’s supposed to take a few minutes, but took closer to 10 since she put so many pigs inside. “It’s incredibly cruel,” she told me, “but it’s how we’re told to do it.”
10am Administered antibiotics to hundreds of young pigs that had been afflicted with “scours” (extreme diarrhea).
11am Lunch break. I ate a Clif Bar and a sandwich with lettuce, tomato, and vegetarian deli meat while we talked about animal-rights groups and speculated which one of us might be working undercover. When it was my turn to be accused, I admitted it and everyone laughed.
12pm Returned to the barns with a co-worker who was carrying a bolt gun. One of the sows in Farrowing had been suffering from a prolapsed uterus for several weeks. Country View does not treat prolapses, so we were told to wait until she had finally finished nursing her young and then euthanize her. By now, the prolapse had turned black and smelled terrible. For the third time this week, it took him more than one bolt to kill the poor sow, causing our supervisor to dub him “Two-Shot Jimmy.”
1pm Volunteered to go help the Gestation Barn workers tattoo ID numbers on the sows. Watched as they battered the sows with spiked mallets dipped in green ink. When my turn came, I pretended I was intimidated by the way the sows were bucking and went back to farrowing, where I gave the sows their feed.
2pm Like every day, everyone converged in the Gestation Barn at the end of the day to perform artificial insemination. Today, about 150 sows were inseminated. Then I “showered out” and punched out.
3pm While driving home, called my supervisor at MFA to let him know I’m okay and brief him about the day’s events.
4pm Got back to my motel room, took off my wire, and showered for a third time that day while the day’s footage uploaded to my laptop. Took some time to chill out, have a beer, and watch the news on TV.
5pm Watched all of the day’s footage and wrote a log explaining what was happening on screen, then wrote a narrative entry in my journal describing the day’s events. These are to assist MFA and law enforcement in understanding the context of the video footage.
8pm Went out for dinner, table for one at the local taqueria. An acquaintance from my basketball league sat down next to me and began talking about music and politics, but when conversation turned to work, I excused myself and went home. 
10pm Charged my video equipment and packed a lunch, set the alarm, and went to bed. Cody Carlson is currently in his second year at Brooklyn Law School, where he is on Law Review. He got an A+ in Animal Rights Law.  Mercy For Animals is currently seeking investigators.

3 HOT BUTTON ANIMAL-WELFARE ISSUES IN AUSTRALIA,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/3-hot-button-animal-welfare-issues-in-australia,"JUNE 25, 2012","In the past year, Australia has become an epicenter of animal-welfare activity, with the work of organizations such as Animals Australia dominating the headlines. The country’s growing consciousness about animal-cruelty issues has led to significant policy shifts at both the state and federal levels—not to mention an increasing cultural acceptance of the vegan lifestyle. As welfare organizations amp up efforts, widespread changes are imminent across the Commonwealth. Here are three important issues making headway in Australia’s agricultural sector. Cattle Exports
A year ago, Australians were stunned when the country’s premier news program, Four Corners, aired a video depicting the horrific treatment of Australian cattle in Indonesia, a primary market for the country’s live-cattle trade. The footage, which showed cows being beaten, mutilated, and abused prior to slaughter, was captured by an undercover investigator from nonprofit Animals Australia, an organization that became instrumental in shaping welfare advancements in the months to follow. Response to the exposé was overwhelming—an estimated 60,000 media stories circulated in its aftermath, giving Animals Australia and other welfare organizations a powerful platform from which to spread their message. Facing mounting public pressure, the Australian government swiftly took action, ordering a month-long suspension of live cattle exports to Indonesia approximately a week after the Four Corners special aired. Not only did the suspension completely derail the livestock-export trade—the effect of which is still being felt a year later—but it gave government officials the opportunity to overhaul welfare regulations for the live-cattle export industry, and implement new, more humane slaughterhouse standards. However, this victory was short lived: in February 2012, new footage surfaced of cattle being severely mistreated in Indonesia, amounting to what the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals identified as 46 potential breaches of the new regulations. Though the treatment of cows in Indonesian slaughterhouses has undoubtedly improved since the media frenzy erupted, a flawed self-regulating welfare system, coupled with Indonesian workers’ confusion about the necessity of new guidelines, has forced Animals Australia to keep a close watch on the industry, urging the federal government to end live-cattle export for good. Slaughterhouse and Farm Conditions
While Australian citizens were incensed at the treatment of the country’s cattle oversees, the spotlight quickly shifted to domestic concerns when new footage emerged—this time depicting disturbing instances of animal cruelty on a slaughterhouse in the Australian state of New South Wales. The video, which was broadcast on top news program Lateline in September, revealed more than 100 violations of Australia’s animal-cruelty laws as outlined in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1979. In an effort to curb the mistreatment of farm animals, government authorities in New South Wales announced in May that all slaughterhouses would be required to hire specially trained officers to ensure that stringent welfare standards were being met. But animal advocates remain concerned that this requirement won’t be enough to manage worker conduct, especially considering the fact that welfare officers are chosen by the facilities themselves. Instead of enforcing what they see as an ineffective policy, activists have proposed installing closed-circuit surveillance cameras to keep constant watch of slaughterhouse operations. New South Wales isn’t the only Australian state modifying its policy regarding animal welfare. In late 2010, pork producers across the country vowed to voluntarily ban the use of gestation crates on pig farms by 2017. Five years shy of that goal, only an estimated third of Australian sows are living outside of the confining enclosures, reports the industry group Australian Pork Limited. Last month, the Australian island state Tasmania announced that it would begin fast-tracking its phase-out of the cruel housing systems, with gestation crates scheduled to be eliminated by mid-2013. Tasmania also made an unprecedented commitment to completely phasing-out the use of hen battery cages—a move applauded by Animals Australia and other welfare advocates. National Food Policy
In the realm of dietary policy, nonprofits Vegan Society of New South Wales and Vegan Australia have turned to lobbying the Australian government to be more inclusive of veg individuals’ dietary needs. In March, the groups banded together to submit new veg-friendly national nutritional guidelines. Calling the current Australian guidelines “discriminatory,” the groups proposed revisions such as renaming the meat-centric fourth food group under the catch-all term “protein,” and reevaluating the guidelines’ emphasis on dairy for proper nutrition. The proposal was a follow-up to the organizations’ 2011 campaign to respond to the country’s National Food Plan Issues Report—an outline of the government’s vision surrounding all food- and agriculture-related policies—to include strategies that would enable the country to forgo its reliance on the exploitation of animals in favor of a more plant-based food system. The groups identified increasing access to fresh produce, bolstering the production of sustainable crops, and improving the health of Australians with a vegan diet as key elements of its strategy. Though these proposed policies have yet to be adopted by the federal government, there is some indication that plant-based diets are becoming increasingly accepted among mainstream Australians. Earlier this month, respected national periodical The Medical Journal of Australia published a pro-veg scientific article entitled “A plant-based diet—good for us and for the planet.” Asserting that the current Western diet of meat and dairy is not only unhealthy but also environmentally unsustainable, the report debunked the notion that a plant-based diet is nutritionally inadequate. Australia is currently on the cutting edge of national and statewide policy on animal-welfare, and has begun to identify the issue as a top priority. But as there are many further goals to reach, welfare organizations will undoubtedly continue to put pressure on the government—and the public—to support policies in defense of animals, paving the way for widespread change.

CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE PASSES HORSE-SLAUGHTER BAN,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/congressional-committee-passes-horse-slaughter-ban,"JUNE 24, 2012","After months of vocal public opposition, Congress is one step closer to reinstating a federal ban on horse slaughter in the US. On Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee passed an amendment that would ban government funding for USDA inspections of horse-slaughter facilities—cutting funding for inspections hinders the commercial viability of the industry by preventing the meat from being sold for human consumption. A restriction on funding was first implemented in 2006, but a November 2011 vote lifted the five-year ban, leading to concerns that horse-slaughter plants could legally reopen. Opponents of horse slaughter call the industry a financial burden that promotes the needless killing of animals not typically consumed in the US. "
ORGANIZATION SUES FDA OVER ANIMAL ANTIBIOTICS,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/organization-sues-fda-over-animal-antibiotics,"JUNE 24, 2012","This week, conservationist group the National Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit against the Food and Drug Administration for withholding documents that analyze the adverse health effects of using antibiotics in animal feed. The organization says it attempted to obtain the documents by filing a Freedom of Information Act request, to which the government agency “failed to respond in a timely fashion.” Earlier this month, a federal judged ruled that the FDA must reconsider its earlier rejection of petitions urging the agency to ban the use of certain antibiotics on farms—a ruling the National Resources Defense Council called “another hugely important victory.” "
5 THINGS I LEARNED ABOUT VEGANISM,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/5-things-i-learned-about-veganism,"JUNE 24, 2012","On Sunday, June 17, I had the privilege of attending The Seed, a vegan lifestyle event in Manhattan. Hosted at 82 Mercer, a sleek event space in the heart of Soho, The Seed was dedicated to sharing information about vegan living and to celebrating our ever-expanding community. The event featured more than 80 vendors, presentations from 17 experts, including health practitioners, athletes, chefs, and activists, three film screenings, performance art, yoga, seven cooking demonstrations, and much more. Amidst all of the excitement, it was hard to distill favorites, but here are five lessons about veganism that I took away from the conference. 1. It’s growing. At 10am, the line for The Seed, which started on Mercer Street, had wrapped around to Broome Street. For the next few hours, the wait to enter the building was about 40 minutes long, and everyone who came persisted anyway: a testament to how badly people wanted to be a part of this special event. Throughout the day, the space remained jam-packed, the food vendors flooded with eager diners and the craft hall full of shoppers. We know that the vegan community is growing, but it’s still a wonderful surprise to see the sheer volume of people whose lives are touched by a compassionate message. 2. It’s more delicious than ever. From chocolate-dipped mulberries to vegan mac ‘n’ cheese, green smoothies to vegan drumsticks, and raw macaroons to red velvet cupcakes, The Seed showcased the very best in vegan cuisine today. I was blown away by the range of what was offered, from raw fare and gluten-free eats to old-fashioned vegan comfort food. Vendors included Terri Organic, a fantastic lunch spot and juice destination in the Flatiron district; The Cinnamon Snail, a vegan and organic food truck; New York’s stellar and unparalleled raw food mecca, Pure Food and Wine; the incredible Candle Cafe; and various purveyors of vegan chocolate. Perhaps most beloved among these vendors was the incredible Mac’n food truck—a vegan mac and cheese truck that had driven all the way up from Miami to NYC for the conference. 3. It’s healthy. Between the screening of Marisa Miller Wolfson’s Vegucated—a documentary in which three New Yorkers learn to improve their quality of life through plant-based diet—the many booths selling nutritional DVDs, and the choice of keynote speaker, Dr. Joel Fuhrman, The Seed was a wonderful place to learn about the connections between plant-based food and good health. Audience members with health questions had the chance to interact with Fuhrman, as well as with Ulka Agarwal, MD, from Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a clinical nutritionist (yours truly), and the energetic and tireless Michael Greger, MD, director of nutrition for the Humane Society of the United States. It’s never been easier to be a healthy vegan, and events like The Seed are proof. 4. It’s active. If you’ve ever had a pushy personal trainer try to persuade you that vegans can’t be athletes, you now have more fodder than ever to set the record straight. The Seed boasted numerous vegan protein powders and snack bars, a Vitamix demo station with healthy green smoothies to help aid in recovery, and presentations from Rich Roll and Brendan Brazier, two of the country’s top elite athletes. Both speakers’ presentations focused on the power of plant foods to fuel performance. 5. It can start with you. One of the day’s most dynamic presentations was from Jasmin Singer and Mariann Sullivan, the women behind the activist nonprofit Our Hen House. Jasmin and Mariann are constantly reminding us we’re all capable of becoming activists: we simply need to put our personal passions and strengths to use. Whether you’re a chef, an athlete, a physician, a filmmaker, an artist, a student, or a blogger, you can use your talent to show people that the vegan lifestyle is vital and rewarding. Sharing a vegan cupcake or macaroon may feel like a small act to you, but it could be the gift that helps another person to embark on a vegan journey. Plant a seed today, and watch it grow tomorrow: that’s what this celebration was all about. Gena Hamshaw is a pre-med student, clinical nutritionist, and VegNews columnist.

NEW VEGAN WEB SERIES LAUNCHES KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/new-vegan-web-series-launches-kickstarter-campaign,"JUNE 23, 2012","The Connecticut-based team behind Eatin’ Vegan, an upcoming web series, is turning to community-fundraising platform Kickstarter to raise money for production and start-up costs. Host Jaclyn Rosenlund first adopted a plant-based diet at the age of 19 after being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. In an effort to share the positive impact veganism has had on her health and well-being, Rosenlund is hoping to help viewers develop better eating habits by presenting her favorite plant-based recipes. The team hopes to raise $35,000 by July 14, the bulk of which will go toward helping Eatin’ Vegan evolve into a self-sustaining series. "
VEGAN VYING FOR MISS ILLINOIS TITLE,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/vegan-vying-for-miss-illinois-title,"JUNE 22, 2012","After being crowned Miss Chicago in March, vegan pageant queen Marisa Buchheit is now hoping to ascend to the title of Miss Illinois, and eventually, Miss America. In a new interview with animal-welfare organization Mercy For Animals, Buchheit shares that she has been an ethical vegan since age 12 and tries to extol the benefits of a plant-based diet to friends and family whenever possible, even inspiring her father to go vegan seven years ago. She also intends to continue performing and appearing at vegan and vegetarian festivals and parades around the country, and, if crowned Miss Illinois or Miss America, to speak out about healthy lifestyle decisions and veganism’s ties with sustainability. The Miss Illinois pageant will take place from June 27 to 30. "
RHODE ISLAND PASSES FARM-ANIMAL WELFARE BILL,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/rhode-island-passes-farm-animal-welfare-bill,"JUNE 21, 2012","Yesterday, Rhode Island passed a landmark animal-welfare bill designed to improve conditions for farm animals in the state. The new policy, which passed both the state Senate and House with overwhelming support before being signed into law, prohibits the use of confining crates for sows and veal calves, and bans the practice of cow-tail docking—a process that involves partially amputating cows’ tails, typically without first administering painkillers. Humane Society of the United States President Wayne Pacelle applauded the move, saying, “Rhode Island is sending the message loud and clear that inhumane factory farming practices simply aren’t sustainable and should be banned.” Rhode Island is the ninth state to ban the use of sow gestation crates, and the seventh and third to ban veal crates and tail docking, respectively.

VEGANS ADVOCATE FOR HEALTHIER FOOD-STAMP CHOICES,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/vegans-advocate-for-healthier-food-stamp-choices,"JUNE 21, 2012","Rory Freedman, co-author of the Skinny Bitch book series, is setting out to raise awareness about the challenges of maintaining a healthy diet while subsisting on the federal food-assistance program. The vegan author purchased a week’s worth of food—primarily grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, and condiments—for a total of $33, the average sum allotted to food-stamp users in California. Freedman’s experiment comes at a time when the program is under tight scrutiny, as Congress debates cutting its funding under the revised Farm Bill. Earlier this week, vegan organization Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine proposed that retailers should accept food stamps for a prescribed list of healthful, plant-based foods, instead of the fatty meats, sodas, and processed foods often favored by food-stamps users.

BON IVER DESIGNS VEGAN SHOE FOR SANCTUARY,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/bon-iver-designs-vegan-shoe-for-sanctuary,"JUNE 21, 2012","Bon Iver frontman Justin Vernon has teamed up with Los Angeles-based shoe company Keep to support animal sanctuary and rescue group Best Friends Animal Society through the sales of a limited-edition, leather-free shoe. Vernon’s creation is made from salmon-colored canvas accented with a fishbone graphic and herringbone accents, and will available as part of Bon Iver’s collection with the brand, which may also include galoshes in the future. The shoe will be available as a limited run worldwide in October, and Keep will be donating a portion of proceeds to the animal-advocacy organization. Vernon isn’t the first musician to try his hand at cruelty-free shoe design; in 2009, garage-punk band No Age designed a vegan line of skate shoes for Emerica, and last month, rocker Lenny Kravitz also designed a vegan shoe for one-for-one brand Toms.

OWNER OF BACKYARD BUTCHERY FACES CRIMINAL CHARGES,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/owner-of-backyard-butchery-faces-criminal-charges,"JUNE 20, 2012","Two months after Mercy For Animals circulated shocking footage of a Los Angeles-area backyard-slaughter operation, the owner of the facility has plead guilty to felony animal cruelty. According to MFA, 26-year-old Roberto Celedon faces 90 days in jail and five years probation following the incident, along with a $4,000 fine, court-ordered animal-cruelty classes, and several other penalties. Celedon was arrested in April after local Animal Control officers raided his illegal operation in response to MFA’s allegations. As a result of that raid, authorities managed to rescue dozens of sick, injured, and neglected animals, who are currently recovering from the ordeal at the nearby Gentle Barn animal sanctuary. "
NEW SURVEY SAYS AMERICANS WANT ANTIBIOTIC-FREE MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/new-survey-says-americans-want-antibiotic-free-meat,"JUNE 20, 2012","The Food and Drug Administration has come under fire in recent months due to its lax regulation of antibiotics on farms, and according to a new survey, the majority of American consumers are on board with that criticism. Surveying more than a thousand people across the country, consumer-advocacy group Consumers Union found that 86 percent wanted greater access to antibiotic-free meat, and more than 60 percent were willing to pay higher prices to get it. The aim of the survey was to influence agricultural practices by proving that antibiotic-free products are in demand. Antibiotics, which are widely used in the agricultural industry to promote the growth of livestock, have been shown to cause drug resistance in humans—a fact many researchers say could threaten public health.

CLIMATE CONFERENCE CRITICIZED FOR SERVING MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/climate-conference-criticized-for-serving-meat,"JUNE 20, 2012","Yesterday, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil began its course, bringing political leaders, scientists, and activists together to devise sustainability initiatives that will decrease greenhouse gas emissions and waste. But an opinion piece from The Washington Post points out a major inconsistency between the conference’s goals and its behavior—the event will be serving meat, which has been named many times over as one of the largest contributors to global pollution and climate change. Authors Frances Kissling and Peter Singer critique the “green-washing” of organic meat—which can create even more methane than its factory-farmed counterpart—and argue that removing meat from the summit’s menu, with an accompanying public statement, would be the most effective means of iterating its agenda to improve sustainability, combat poverty, and increase environmental protection.

NY POLITICIAN CALLS FOR BETTER TREATMENT OF DAIRY COWS,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/ny-politician-calls-for-better-treatment-of-dairy-cows,"JUNE 19, 2012","New York State Senator Tony Avella has teamed up with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to demand better welfare policies on dairy farms. Last week, the politician held a screening of PETA’s most recent farm exposé, which depicts alleged animal cruelty on Adirondack Farms, LLC in upstate New York. The footage, released in March, prompted Avella to reach out to Agri-Mark—a dairy-farmer cooperative that oversees operations at several New England farms, including Adirondack. “If we don’t get a response, we may have to take legislative action to ensure the animals are treated humanely,” says Avella, who added that the behavior revealed in the exposé was “inappropriate.” "
"CHAKA KHAN GOES VEGAN, BOOSTS HEALTH",https://vegnews.com/2012/6/chaka-khan-goes-vegan-boosts-health,"JUNE 19, 2012","In a new interview with the Huffington Post, singer Chaka Khan reveals that she went vegan after finding out that she had developed type-2 diabetes and high blood pressure. In addition to forgoing meat and dairy, Khan did a four-month fruit- and vegetable-juice fast and lost 60 pounds, returning to a healthier, svelter figure, which she showed off at last month’s American Idol finale. The diva, who no longer has to take medication for her high blood pressure, says that she was inspired to regain control of her health by the birth of her new baby granddaughter.   "
LGBT RIGHTS AND ANIMAL RIGHTS: HOW ARE THEY CONNECTED?,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/lgbt-rights-and-animal-rights-how-are-they-connected,"JUNE 19, 2012","Recently, we have witnessed major strides in both the animal-rights and gay-rights movements. In honor of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) Month, we spoke with activists about what these two groups can learn from each other, and how we can support the work of both. Three proud gay vegans—Ari Solomon, president of A Scent of Scandal; Dan Hanley, half of the blogging duo behind The Gay Vegans; and Jasmin Singer, co-founder of Our Hen House—weighed in on key points in both movements. VegNews: How do you see the connection between the animal-rights movement and gay rights?
Ari Solomon: In the simplest terms, I believe that most LGBT men and women understand firsthand what’s it like to be oppressed and bullied. This is what happens to animals every day, whether it is on factory farms, or in laboratories, circuses, and marine parks. I try to make the case that because we know how it feels, we should be more inclined to go vegan and get involved with trying to end the war on animals. 
Dan Hanley: Both fall into our goal of “making the world a better place for all living beings.” I believe that injustice is injustice, regardless of the community it affects or how voiceless the affected community is.
Jasmin Singer: I believe that the fundamental connection between gay rights and animal rights, as well as countless other rights movements, is the mindset of the oppressor, which is always based in the thought that, “I am better, and more important, than they are.” VN: There is so much happening in both movements—the legalization of gay marriage is on the forefront of this election, and several major companies are phasing out gestation crates, among other pivotal issues. What are some other great strides forward that we’re seeing?
AS: With regards to gay rights, it’s wonderful that marriage is on everyone’s mind, but the truth is that you can still be fired from your job just for being gay in 29 states. I do think, however, that we are seeing amazing leaps in progress in such relatively short spans of time. I really think that in the next 10 years, LGBT people will achieve full equality in the US. With regards to animal rights, it’s been incredible to witness the growing public concern over animals on factory farms. That being said, I think the growing awareness around veganism is what excites me the most.
JS: There is much more awareness of both issues, as is evidenced by the increase in positive media coverage. And there is no doubt that the increasing acceptance of gay marriage represents a deep societal shift, though issues of discrimination and violence still remain. Though not on the same level, attention to farmed-animal issues is clearly on the rise, and the potential eradication of the gestation crate is a notable step forward, though we still have a very, very long way to go. VN: How can activists get involved in LGBT Pride month?
AS: There are so many organizations on national and local levels that are always looking for volunteers and donations. Some of my favorites are The Trevor Project and the Matthew Shepard Foundation. But I think the most important thing to do as an LGBT activist is to talk about these issues with your friends and family.
DH: The best thing an activist can do is find out who their state representative is, and find out their opinions on marriage equality, animal rights, and any other topic important to them. All one has to do is plug in their zip code on votesmart.org to find out who represents them at their state house. VN: In our July+August 2011 issue, Portia de Rossi told us that, “I think it’s more difficult to be vegan than gay. I think people have a harder time accepting it; people feel more uncomfortable with a vegan at their dinner table than they do a lesbian.” What do you think?
AS: In my opinion, homophobia is much different psychologically than an aversion to veganism. Men and women are beaten and killed just for being gay. My veganism might make certain people uncomfortable, but I’ve never feared for my life for being vegan. I have for being gay.
DH: With many of us living in privilege, myself included, I need to remember that LGBT people who live in poverty, live in very conservative areas, or who are yet to come out face many things an “out” vegan does not face—mainly the potential of harassment, name-calling, losing their job, and even brutality and death.
JS: Living in downtown Manhattan, it’s almost assumed you’re gay! Others aren’t as lucky to live in a place where they are accepted. But I think Portia makes a good point in differentiating the reasons that people might give you a hard time. Not everyone feels threatened by homosexuality, but almost everyone who isn’t vegan recognizes, on some level, that they should be vegan. VN: In your own personal journey to come out and go vegan, what challenges did you face?
AS: I think it’s just about having the courage to live authentically and not be afraid to stand out. Luckily, I haven’t had too many people in my life who have an issue with either. My father had a mini-meltdown when I told him I went vegan (it was so much worse than telling him I was gay) but over the years he’s learned more about the issues, and now he begs my husband and I to cook for him when we’re back home!
DH: I was in the military when I came out, and it was extremely difficult living two lives and constantly having to lie. This was in 1990, and of course, times have changed. At the time I was also incredibly grateful for the loving support I had both off and on base. My activism began within the AIDS movement in the late ‘80s and I am always grateful for the many people who engaged me and taught me how to fight for what is right. Becoming vegan was a little difficult as I was living in the South and not in a major metropolitan area.
JS: When I came out 14 years ago, I faced some initial skepticism, worry, and misguided hurt from some family members. It seems almost ludicrous since those people are now extremely accepting of my partner and me. Of course, a lot of kids and young adults who come out face much worse ramifications from their friends and family. I can’t help but note that my dietary shift from meat-eating to vegetarianism, then to veganism, immediately preceded me shifting my sexual identity (straight to bisexual, bisexual to gay). Perhaps as I began to live a life in harmony with my ethics, I opened up space within myself to be true to my identity as a lesbian.

PROBIOTICS CURB BACTERIAL INFECTIONS IN CHICKENS,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/probiotics-curb-bacterial-infections-in-chickens,"JUNE 19, 2012","Researchers from Spain and Finland may have found a viable alternative to using superbug-breeding antibiotics on chickens. While investigating possible ways to inhibit the growth of campylobacter—a strain of bacteria found in chickens’ digestive tracts that causes food-borne illness in humans—researchers discovered that probiotic supplements intended for human use were effective in controlling the pathogen. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, campylobacter sickens an estimated 2.4 million Americans each year, usually after they consume or handle infected chicken. As food scientists attempt to find solutions for farmers’ overreliance on antibiotics, probiotics could prove to be a valuable tool in curbing infectious disease without using potentially harmful drugs.

CHIPOTLE UPS SOURCING FROM PASTURE-RAISED ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/chipotle-ups-sourcing-from-pasture-raised-animals,"JUNE 18, 2012","Only weeks after publicly expressing its support for a pending Food and Drug Administration ban on the usage of antibiotics in livestock feed, fast-food chain Chipotle has announced that it will henceforth be sourcing all of its sour cream—as well as 65 percent of its cheese—from pasture-raised cows. Yesterday, Founder and Co-CEO Steve Ells stated in a press release that Chipotle aims to obtain all of its ingredients from sustainable sources with higher welfare standards than its competitors. The pasture-raised cows are fed an all-vegetarian diet and have access to the outdoors, and none of the company’s dairy cows are treated with recombinant bovine growth hormone. In February, Chipotle began airing an anti-factory farming campaign, which aims to raise awareness about the ethical concerns of large-scale animal-raising operations. "
DRIVE-IN CHAIN SONIC ELIMINATING GESTATION CRATES,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/drive-in-chain-sonic-eliminating-gestation-crates,"JUNE 18, 2012","Shortly after Cracker Barrel’s recent announcement that it intends to phase out the use of gestation crates, fast-food giant Sonic has also pledged to eliminate the cruel enclosures from its pork-supply chain. Sonic, the country’s largest drive-in chain, has set a 10-year time-frame for the phase-out, though it ideally would like to complete the transition by 2017. Sonic’s decision comes fresh on the heels of announcements from fellow restaurant chains McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, and Denny’s, all of which committed to discontinuing their use of the crates earlier this year. Gestation crates have come under fire in recent months due to their confining nature, which restricts even the basic movement of sows. Photo courtesy of Phoenix Smooth Jazz Blog "
SALES OF WHALE MEAT FACING STEEP DECLINE IN JAPAN,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/sales-of-whale-meat-facing-steep-decline-in-japan,"JUNE 18, 2012","According to a new report from the Dolphin and Whale Action Network, Japan’s whale-meat industry is struggling to stay afloat as demand for the product wanes. Though commercial whaling has been prohibited since 1986, the country allows the mammals to be hunted for scientific purposes, after which byproducts collected during the research process can be auctioned off for consumption. This year’s auction failed to attract consumer interest, with three-quarters of whale meat products remaining unsold—a fact the Institute of Cetacean Research partially blames on intensified criticism from anti-whaling groups such as Sea Shepherd. Earlier this year, conservationist groups declared a victory after Sea Shepherd interrupted a Japanese research expedition in Antarctica, forcing the vessel to return home with just 30 percent of its intended catch.

GROUP PREDICTS DRAMATIC RISE IN VEG PRODUCT SALES,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/group-predicts-dramatic-rise-in-veg-product-sales,"JUNE 17, 2012","A new report from UK-based market-research group Key Note demonstrates that the vegetarian-food industry is enjoying a significant increase in sales, and will continue to do so at an accelerated rate in coming years. Between 2007 and 2011, the UK market grew by 7.7 percent, with the number of high-end vegetarian restaurants in the UK increasing by 50 percent during that time period. Key Note attributes the growth to the move of vegetarian products into mainstream retailers, as well as alarm about rising obesity levels and environmental detriment due to meat consumption and livestock farming, respectively. The firm foresees sales reaching £882.4 million—or nearly $1.4 billion—by 2016, up from £799.7 million in 2012. "

After discovering that the hospital cuts anesthetized pigs to teach emergency medical protocol and then euthanizes them, the organization filed a legal complaint with the state attorney, urging officials to investigate this element of the curriculum. PCRM points out that 98 percent of Advanced Trauma Life Support training programs use non-animal simulations. Because Hartford Hospital reportedly already owns one such simulator, the organization argues that the facility should replace their current teaching method with a more humane approach. "
KICKSTARTER FOR NEW VEGAN RESTAURANT IN BROOKLYN,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/kickstarter-for-new-vegan-restaurant-in-brooklyn,"JUNE 17, 2012","Two Brooklyn-based friends and longtime food-industry workers are hoping to fulfill their dream of opening a vegan restaurant—ideally in time for their impending 10-year high school reunion—and are turning to fundraising platform Kickstarter to help them raise $2,000 in start-up costs. Last Sunday, the pair debuted their cruelty-free fare under the name Heirloom Vegan Eatery at the summer Vegan Shop-Up market. The event gave attendees a sneak peak at Heirloom’s prospective menu, which includes dishes such as Southern-style fried chicken sandwiches, seitan gyros, and pulled pork sliders. The Heirloom team has until July 4 to obtain the funds for their project. "
5 VEG-CENTRIC SPIRITUAL PRACTICES,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/5-veg-centric-spiritual-practices,"JUNE 17, 2012","There are plenty of good reasons to follow a veg diet—animal welfare, nutrition, and environmental impact are primary motivators. But for some, these reasons are fueled by a higher calling, whether it’s a commitment to an almighty deity, a desire to live righteously, or a moral obligation rooted in compassion for all beings. Though interpretations of spiritual beliefs are highly subjective, many people are turning to vegan and vegetarian lifestyles based on their religious convictions. These five lesser-known spiritual philosophies, whether traditionally veg or not, have led many followers toward a plant-based path. Hare Krishna
Perhaps best known for their vivacious public chanting, devotees of Hare Krishna believe that enlightenment is achieved by maintaining a pure way of living—one that reflects the teachings of the Hindu god Krishna, as revealed in sacred texts such as the Bhagavad-gita. Consuming meat is contrary to this belief system, which condemns the killing and exploitation of all living beings. Though traditionally lacto-vegetarian due to Krishna’s frequent depiction as a butter-loving cow herder, some members of the Hare Krishna community are foregoing animal products altogether as more begin to question dairy’s place in a karmic lifestyle. Vegan hunger relief organization Food for Life Global, whose inception was inspired by Hare Krishna founder Srila Prabhupada, refrains from offering its financial support to food-distribution projects that use dairy, though many FFLG affiliates do. As the organization points out, Hare Krishna devotees are increasingly adopting what is becoming known as a “Krishna-dairian” (also “Prasadarian”) diet, meaning they refuse to support the commercial dairy industry, which slaughters the majority of its cows. Instead, those who opt to consume dairy products do so only if it comes from “non-violent” Hare Krishna-sanctioned farms, which purport to treat their cows with respect and veneration in a loving and nurturing environment. Jainism
Like Hare Krishna, Jainism has its roots in India, though it varies significantly from Hare Krishna in its core belief system—Jains don’t believe in a god or gods who must be obeyed and worshiped, but rather a more universal sense of the divine. This ancient religious practice revolves around the notion that all beings in the universe deserve to be treated with respect and compassion, as every living thing on Earth possesses a soul of equal value. As such, following a plant-based diet is instrumental to minimizing harm to the universe and all of its creatures. Jains sometimes permit the consumption of certain dairy products, but generally only under strict conditions that reflect their spiritual philosophy. Still, many Jains around the world have opted to integrate veganism into their religious practice. American legal scholar Gary Francione, a pioneering figure in abolitionist animal rights theory, has voiced his acceptance of the vegan Jain lifestyle. Likewise, revered Jain gurus such as Gurudev Chitrabhanuji have spoken out about the importance of eliminating all animal products from one’s diet. Kosher Veganism
Many practicing Jews believe Jewish dietary laws are consistent with ethical veganism, and use Biblical and sacred texts to substantiate their lifestyle choice. Several prominent rabbis have stated that abstaining from eating meat is central to one’s spiritual duty, especially given the rampant cruelty taking place on factory farms around the world. Rabbi David Rosen, formerly the chief rabbi of Ireland, once said, “The current treatment of animals in the livestock trade definitely renders the consumption of meat halakhically unacceptable … In contemporary society, more than ever before, vegetarianism should be an imperative for Jews who seek to live in accordance with Judaism’s most sublime teachings.” At the Shamayim V’Aretz Institute, spiritual leaders and devotees take Rabbi David Rosen’s philosophy one step further, advocating for an all-encompassing cruelty-free lifestyle. The Institute, co-founded by vegan actress Mayim Bialik, serves as a resource center for those interested in melding their faith with their compassionate ideals. Part of the organization’s mission is to dispel the myth that veganism is somehow incompatible with Jewish ideals and cultural traditions. Furthermore, as the Institute points out, pairing veganism and Judaism is nothing new—many top vegan restaurants, including New York City’s Blossom and Los Angeles’ Real Food Daily, are certified kosher. Rastafarianism
Followers of modern Rastafarianism believe that humanity and divinity are ultimately linked, with spiritual salvation occurring on Earth rather than on a heavenly plane. Along with these principles, Rastafarians view life and nature as sacred entities that require preservation and protection. This environmentalist inclination is reflected in the philosophy’s respect for animals, which partially serves as the motivation many Rastafarians have to forgo eating animals or animal products. Furthermore, Rastafarians generally follow what is known as an Ital diet—a holistic and pure diet of whole, plant-based foods. The word “Ital” fuses the words “vital” and “I,” creating a term that references at once the energizing force of nature’s bounty, and the importance of maintaining optimum health. Though not everyone who follows an Ital diet is vegan, there are several all-vegan restaurants around the country offering top-notch Ital cuisine, particularly in New York, which has a vibrant Jamaican population. Brooklyn’s Ital Shak is just one locale where diners can enjoy inexpensive stews, veggie-packed patties, and faux meat masterpieces. Seventh Day Adventist
The Seventh-Day Adventist faith is a branch of Christianity that emphasizes healthy living, and encourages vegetarianism. Co-founder of the religion Ellen White believes that god originally intended humankind to subsist on plants for sustenance. “God gave our first parents the food He designed that the race should eat. It was contrary to His plan to have the life of any creature taken. There was to be no death in Eden. The fruit of the trees in the garden was the food man’s wants required,” she wrote. Many sources argue veganism as a preference over vegetarianism in the Seventh-Day Adventist philosophy. As the link between health and a well-rounded plant-based diet becomes more pronounced in the mainstream, Seventh-Day Adventists are pioneering efforts to bring vegan foods to their constituents, as well as to the world at large. Last year, the Portland, OR Adventist Medical Center opened LivingWell Bistro, a vegan eatery that serves wholesome organic meals. With dishes such as Chia Caesar Salad, raw pasta, and hearty quinoa bowls, this food is a far cry from traditional hospital fare. Whether your religion is central to your identity, or you’re more practical than pious, every vegan and vegetarian can learn something from the teachings of the spiritually inclined, whose faith-fueled devotion to animal welfare is of value to compassionate creatures of all species and creeds.

STUDY SAYS FARM RUNOFF CONTAINS HARMFUL HORMONES,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/study-says-farm-runoff-contains-harmful-hormones,"JUNE 14, 2012","Researchers from the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center have determined that wastewater from dairy farms contains potentially dangerous concentrations of estrogenic hormones—concentrations that could have a detrimental effect on the surrounding environment, and perhaps even threaten our food and water supply. According to the study, as cows lactate, they naturally excrete hormones in their urine and feces. However, because of the vast number of cows living on factory farms, wastewater has become a highly concentrated source of estrogen in the environment. Researchers say the presence of these hormones in farm wastewater could impair the reproductive functions of nearby aquatic animals, and could potentially enter the food supply by contaminating local crops.

The measure, which was approved for the November ballot this week, would require most raw and processed foods containing GMOs to modify their packaging by 2014, though certain items, such as organic foods and alcohol, would be exempt. Likewise, the initiative wouldn’t apply to meat and dairy companies that feed their animals genetically modified grains—a fact opponents of the measure call a considerable loophole. Still, those who support the proposal say it helps empower consumers to make informed choices about the foods they buy. Similar measures are currently under review in several states, including Connecticut and Vermont. "

RAW ROMANCE NOVEL MODEL,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/raw-romance-novel-model,"JUNE 4, 2012","Two surprising things have recently come to light in the arena of Harlequin romance novels: first, that they use actual models, not just artistic renditions of brawny men and lusty ladies. Second, one such hunky model, Nathane Jackson, makes readers’ hearts go pitter pat on a totally plant-based diet. VegNews caught up with the 35-year-old fitness model, personal trainer, and cowboy/doctor/detective to chat about his transition from meathead to model citizen. VegNews: How did you go vegan?
Nathane Jackson: My mom was battling cancer for the greater portion of 10 years. In the ninth year, we were in the hospital at Christmastime and realized that she probably wasn’t going to be getting out of there, so we decided to do alternative-therapy research. Nutrition kept coming up, and at the time I was eating copious amounts of meat. Everything I came up with in the research was more plant-based diet, especially for someone who’s sick. I realized that as much I looked great aesthetic-wise, internally I was concerned about my health and my blood work. My mom actually saw a naturopath when she got out of the hospital and went through a kind of blood type diet, which I wasn’t really too keen on when I first heard about it because I really didn’t know anything about it, and it was very different from my bodybuilder-ish nutrition at the time. Long story short, the alternative therapy of megadose vitamin C and the blood-type nutrition plan did help her out quite a bit for most of a year. Unfortunately, some other things happened, and she ended up getting ill again and passing away in the fall of 2010. There was a time between the moment she got out of the hospital and started taking the vitamin C, until about June, that she was living her life the way she should have lived it for the previous 10 years. It was amazing how she got out of her deathbed and was able to live her life, so I kept digging deeper into the research, consulting different people like Gabriel Cousens. The more I studied his work, the more it resonated with me. And even though my mom passed, there way a silver lining: I stopped looking at the outside, the aesthetics of somebody or myself, and started looking at the inside. VN: How did you get involved in competitive fitness?
NJ: I was in Vancouver, and there was a competition coming to town, and I liked a challenge. I didn’t care how I placed, if I won or came in last, I just wanted a goal. I came in second in that competition, and I got the bug. After that I competed six or seven times and had a lot of success early on. When you do well in the competitions, magazines take notice, and at the time supplement companies were something that I wanted to be involved with, and they approached me, and wanted to know if I’d be the face of this or the spokesmodel for that, so it sort of just fell into my lap. VN: How did you become a romance novel cover model?
NJ: That was again the product of a competition. I was walking home one day, and my spouse called and said she’d just heard on the radio that Harlequin is doing a next Harlequin cover guy open casting, and today’s the last day. I was only three or four blocks away, so I went. ET Canada was actually leaving as I was walking in—I didn’t know why they were there, but I saw the bags and the truck and everything else. I just made it, I was the last guy in that day. There was a whole panel of judges, who I came to find out are all the Harlequin art directors. One guy asked, can you take your shirt off? And I thought, wait what kind of casting am I in? But you know for Harlequin covers—unless you’re in the millionaire line—you’re almost always shirtless. So no problem, took my shirt off, and I was so prepared physically for the competition that they were like, wow, this guy’s ripped and he’s tall. They had a lot of younger guys in there, and the women who read the books had expressed interest in a little bit older models on the cover, so I guess I fit that category. So it was the right place, right time for sure. VN: We have to ask: do you read the novels?
NJ: I’ve read a few, but out of the 70 I’ve done, it’s probably in the single-digit percentage. My spouse and I actually did a cover together, so that was really nice. And this is kind of why I don’t read them, is because family members pick copies up, and they tell me what I’m doing in these novels. They say every time they read these they’re thinking of me. That’s kind of weird and awkward, isn’t it?   Photo by Robert Goshgarian "
FDA APPEALS DECISION TO BAN ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/fda-appeals-decision-to-ban-antibiotics-in-feed,"JUNE 3, 2012","After a magistrate judge ordered the Food and Drug Administration to enforce a 35-year-old ban on antibiotics in animal feed, the federal agency has filed an appeal to overturn the decision. According to a notice dated May 21, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, along with Director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine Bernadette Dunham and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, filed a motion with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in an attempt to challenge the ruling, which will prohibit the nonmedical use of penicillin and tetracycline unless drug companies can demonstrate that they have no impact on public health. If the appeal is denied, representatives from pharmaceutical companies will be required to testify as to their products’ safety before the FDA—the first step toward implementing the ban. "
"HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS FOUND IN MEAT, PEANUT BUTTER",https://vegnews.com/2012/6/hazardous-chemicals-found-in-meat-peanut-butter,"JUNE 3, 2012","Researchers at the University of Texas School of Public Health have discovered the presence of the harmful chemical hexabromocyclododecane, or HBCD, in nearly half of all samples of cold cuts, turkey, fish, beef, peanut butter, and other foods rich in fat and protein. HBCD, which the Environmental Protection Agency has referred to as “highly toxic,” is typically found as a flame-retarding agent in foam insulation, and can be detrimental to the human reproductive system. While scientists are concerned about the prevalance of the substance, the amount of HBCD present has not yet been determined to be dangerous to consumers, and the foods used in the study were all purchased in the area in and around Dallas, TX between 2009 and 2010.

Q&A WITH CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATE BRYAN PEASE,https://vegnews.com/2012/6/qandampa-with-city-council-candidate-bryan-pease,"JUNE 3, 2012","Lawyer by trade and animal advocate to the core, Bryan Pease has no shortage of accomplishments under his belt. The San Diego, CA resident co-founded the influential nonprofit Animal Protection and Rescue League while still in law school, and continues to use his legal expertise to fight for animal welfare. Between campaigning on behalf of seals in the La Jolla area—in 2009, Pease won a federal court order protecting their habitat from destruction—and serving on the Board of Directors of the Ocean Beach People’s Organic Foods Market, Pease has been hard at work campaigning for City Council, a position he hopes will further his progressive cause. We caught up with this hardworking political hopeful, as he counts down the hours until June 5’s primary election. VegNews: What are the central points of your platform?
Bryan Pease: I stand for open government, accountability, transparency, and fiscal responsibility. I am particularly against corporate welfare in the form of bailouts and handouts to the wealthy one percent. The push toward privatization of city pensions and services—which both the incumbent and her wealthiest challenger favors—is sold as a way to benefit taxpayers, but it actually ends up benefiting special interests and costing the public. VN: How has your background as an animal-welfare activist and lawyer informed your political aspirations?
BP: I have been involved in activism for environmental, animal, and human rights for the better part of two decades, and I have been a lawyer for about a third of that time. The difference in the level of impact I was able to have as an activist versus what I am able to accomplish as a lawyer has been astounding to me. This is my first foray into electoral politics for public office, and I can already see the potential to have a similarly greater impact than what I am accomplishing now. VN: How has the community responded to your campaign?
BP: Community response has been overwhelmingly positive. A new 100-percent organic, plant-based restaurant in San Diego called Casa de Luz even painted a chalk portrait of me on their wall encouraging people to support my campaign. The June 5 election is an open primary, meaning everyone can vote for whichever candidate they want regardless of party affiliation. There are four candidates in this race, and if I can finish in the top two, then I will be in the runoff in November. VN: What are the most important things you’ve learned through this process?
BP: The most important thing to take away from the election process is that simply being part of the process is important. Those who contributed to my campaign will be happy to know that this enabled me to send literature to voters addressing the issues that probably motivated these donations in the first place. I have also been able to discuss the issues in debates and forums, and with other elected officials who look at me differently and are more open now that I am a candidate and know what it’s like for them. There are two other very progressive and animal-friendly candidates on the ballot with me who VegNews readers should know about: Bob Filner for Mayor, and Lori Saldaña for the 52nd Congressional district. Get out to vote June 5! "

In May, the farm was the site of a massive riot, which began after residents barricaded the facility complaining of foul odors and environmental contamination in the surrounding area. The farm’s pigs, who were left unattended throughout the five-day protest, began to die of starvation and dehydration, prompting Chilean authorities to declare the situation a health emergency and shut down operations indefinitely. Though initial reports said the remaining pigs would be transported to nearby farms, the owner says they will be slaughtered instead. International nonprofit Compassion in World Farming is urging its supporters to reach out to Chilean officials and protest the decision. "

One Ohio farmer installed $70,000 worth of waterbeds for his 220 cows, which he says have since begun producing more milk with fewer impurities. While proponents say these methods improve the animals’ quality of life, some animal-welfare advocates argue that dairy production is an inherently cruel process, regardless of the presence of such amenities.

Earlier this week, Sea Shepherd activist and Ocean Warrior Captain Paul Watson was released from German police custody after being arrested in connection with endangering a Costa Rican fishing vessel in 2002 while attempting to protect sharks and other marine wildlife. After witnessing the crew of the ship finning sharks, Watson and his crew confronted the ship with permission from Guatemalan authorities. While he has since been bailed out, Watson hopes that the incident will raise awareness about ocean conservation. “We have all the laws and regulations we need to protect our oceans, but we don’t have governments with the guts to enforce those regulations,” he tells CNN.

100 YEARS OF HEALTH WITH PATRICIA BRAGG,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/100-years-of-health-with-patricia-bragg,"MAY 22, 2012","I first met Patricia Bragg years ago at Natural Products Expo West, the annual Southern California trade show that attracts nearly 60,000 people each March. Dressed in head-to-toe pink and donning her signature straw hat adorned with faux flowers, the 4-foot-10 powerhouse had dozens of people waiting in line to meet her. Her father, Paul C. Bragg, founder of Bragg Live Foods, opened the country’s first health food store in 1912 and is credited with starting the natural food movement in America. Patricia, who worked alongside her father until he passed away 36 years ago, now heads up the company, is a best-selling author (9 million copies of Apple Cider Vinegar—Miracle Health System have sold worldwide), and runs a 120-acre organic farm (which also doubles as the Bragg headquarters) just outside of Santa Barbara, CA. A lifelong vegetarian, the influence of Patricia and her family—on everyone from Cloris Leachman, Dick Gregory, and the Beach Boys to Katy Perry, George Clooney, and Donald Trump—continues to reach nearly every corner of the world. VegNews: Congratulations on the 100-year anniversary of Bragg Foods. What an amazing accomplishment. How has the business lasted 100 years?
Patricia Bragg: What motivates us most is changing people’s lives. We’re thrilled when people go from sickness to healthy living after learning about the power of fresh food. Our goal has always been to be health crusaders, which is something my father said from the very beginning. VN: What was your household like growing up?
PB: People knew he was the boss, of the business and the family. We had our principles we lived by: There was no smoking, no swearing, no bad words, no white sugar, no white bread. Only healthy food, and we grew everything we possibly could ourselves on our little farm in Walnut Creek, CA. We lived in peace and never locked our house. VN: Were you raised vegetarian?
PB: Yes, since birth. The thought of eating dead flesh—what a terrible thought. VN: How did your father start on his health food crusade?
PB: They say necessity is the mother of invention. When my father was in boarding school, he received a scholarship to a very expensive military school after saving a wealthy man from drowning in the ocean. He probably wasn’t thrilled about the military part, but he thought it was a great honor. Well, many boys at the school got tuberculosis, including my dad. After being moved to a third sanatorium, where he was getting sicker and sicker, he met a Swiss exchange nurse who saved his life and taught him how to get healthy. You see, in the old days, they forced bed rest on you, closed the windows, and your body would just shrivel up. You didn’t get proper food. And they wondered why so many people were dying of TB. So this Swiss nurse told him that in Switzerland, people were being cured from tuberculosis with sunshine, fresh food, massage, and water therapy. After getting better, my father made a pact that he’d spend the rest of his life being a health crusader. VN: These principles make so much sense, but why are we still having such a hard time convincing America of what it takes to be healthy?
PB: Unfortunately, there’s a lot of commercial things that bring people down. The drug industry, the commercial food industry, the sugar industry, the flour industry—they’ve all gotten a stranglehold on America’s food habits. I think they make things so complicated that it confuses people. Keep your life simple, and remember you are what you eat. It’s as simple as that. What you’re eating and drinking can bring you health or sickness. VN: Your dad opened the first health food store in Los Angeles in 1912 and later traveled for eight to 10 months per year promoting the benefits of juicing, fasting, and healthy food. What was it like to travel around the country with your family?
PB: We went all over America. We scheduled free lectures and then ask people, “Who wants to open the first health food store?” We would supply them with Bragg health foods (herbal teas, seven grain cereals, etc.) on consignment. And we would never ask for a dime until everything was sold. I remember that people were so loving and kind, and I loved it. VN: Your father was also quite the media mogul, as he hosted popular programs on TV and the radio. Tell us about those.
PB: Dad pioneered radio (in the 1920s, he was on three times a day). He pioneered television with a program called Health and Happiness, where we had celebrities on, five days a week, half hour each. We would feature an exercise, a recipe, and a different guest each day. One day, we heard from the president of the American Medical Association because he wanted to be on the show. Our producer didn’t want him, but my dad said, “no problem.” So he came on and said, “Thank you for promoting health in America!” VN: When did you get involved with the family business?
PB: I was ready to go off to Africa to be a missionary and was washing the dishes one night at home in Burbank. We lived right near Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Warner Brothers. Dad was sitting at the kitchen table. He said, “Patricia, would you mind giving me one year at Bragg Health Crusader? Just one year, and then go to Africa?” I said, “Just one year?” I went over to him and gave him a big hug and said, “Of course I will.” One year became a lifetime, and I’ve loved every minute of it. VN: What is some of the best advice your father gave you?
PB: “Think, plot, follow-through.” He applied this to business, his personal life, and his financial life. VN: In recent years, natural food stores have become flooded with packaged foods. How do feel about that?
PB: It’s very confusing. I’d like people to try to grow everything they can themselves. My father used to call them “victory gardens,” now I call them survival or health gardens. Take half your lawn and put in a garden. Take all your fences and walls of your home and have climbing squash, sugar peas, cherry tomatoes, and green beans, as they can all go up vines. During the Depression, families that did the best grew their own food. Now, we’ve gotten lazy. VN: What are the worst offenders of the Standard American Diet?
PB: People are killing themselves with their knives and forks. If you’re going to eat dead, chemicalized, pesticized foods, I’m sorry, you’re going to get sick. My top offenders: dairy, coffee, sugar, refined foods, fat, fast foods, processed foods, and sugary drinks. VN: Why do you think fasting is essential to good health?
PB: It cleanses and detoxes. It’s the miracle doctor within your body. All of a sudden, your body is not digesting, eliminating, and assimilating food. And the body workers can get in and clean house. That’s why it’s so vitally important that you learn to fast. Every religion has a period of fasting, and it’s been used for centuries to heal the sick. When you use it correctly, fasting can help reverse the aging process. I fast every Monday and the first three days of every month. My weight has never gone over 105 pounds, my cholesterol level is normal, and I’ve never had high blood pressure. VN: I’ve heard about the virtues of apple cider vinegar for years and know it’s your top-selling product. What is so great about it?
PB: In 400 BC, Hippocrates treated his patients with apple cider vinegar because it was a powerful cleanser that heals. It’s a naturally occurring antibiotic and anticeptic, and it fights germs and bacteria in your body. It also lowers the glycemic index of a meal when taken with the meal or before it, so it’s very beneficial for diabetics. VN: What are some of your own health secrets?
PB: I brush my body every day, fast every week, drink eight glasses of water a day, three with apple cider vinegar. After showering, I pour some diluted vinegar all over my body and dry myself with a Turkish towel. I then put a little organic olive oil on my face and gently rub it in. Three times a week, I give myself an olive oil massage. VN: With your wealth of knowledge of maintaing good health, what do you eat on a typical day?
PB: Every morning, I drink a fruit smoothie. My father started smoothies, so I’m big on that. It’s filled with fresh-squeezed orange or grapefruit juice, spirulina powder, dates, almond butter, bananas, and purified water. For lunch, I’ll have a beautiful garden salad with raw beets, raw turnips, one or two radishes, two celery stalks, sugar snap peas, tender string beans, red cabbage, and cucumbers. I’ll have this with a little Bragg dressing. I used to make my own, but now this is so much more convenient. For dinner, I’ll have a fresh artichoke that I cut myself and steam in a steamer basket. I open the little leaves and stuff fresh garlic in there and a pinch of Bragg sprinkles. I’ll also have a baked yam with a little lecithin granules, which I use like butter. I don’t eat late at night and try to have dinner by 5:30pm. VN: I’ve read for years your philosophy on age. Can you share it with our readers?
PB: I don’t believe in age. I feel ageless and believe in eternity. In my heart, I feel 18, so why should I give you an age? If I said “18,” you would think that was ridiculous. I don’t have an ache or pain, and I have no stiffness. Age is just in our head. VN: I don’t know a single vegetarian who doesn’t have a bottle of Bragg Liquid Aminos in their pantry. Why is it unique?
PB: It’s a much healthier version of soy sauce. A lot of the ones on the market use preservatives, artificial color, caramel color, alcohol, and added salt. Bragg Liquid Aminos is non-fermented and lower in sodium than many brands. And we’re the only company using non-GMO soy beans. Even the Dalai Lama travels with a bottle everywhere he goes! VN: How involved are you today with the day-to-day business?
PB: I live it, love it, and sleep it. I love my outreach and am very involved. I’ve been in the business for more than 55 years and am now president and CEO. And dad is with me on every decision. Food for Thought from Patricia Bragg:
1. “Live food makes live people.”
2. “Fast regularly and help the body heal itself and stay well.”
3. “When you’re down, you have to get up and move on.”
4. “Your body carries you throughout life, so take care of it.”
5. “If you’re going to eat dead, chemicalized, pesticized foods, you’re going to get sick.” Want to eat like Patricia? Check out her go-to morning smoothie recipe! Follow VegNews’ co-founder Colleen Holland on Facebook here. "
RED MEAT AND BUTTER MAY IMPAIR BRAIN FUNCTION,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/red-meat-and-butter-may-impair-brain-function,"MAY 21, 2012","Proponents of plant-based diets have long argued that eating meat and dairy can be detrimental to one’s cardiovascular health, but new research suggests that these foods may cause neurological damage as well. According to a new study conducted by Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the saturated fat found in certain foods can lead to cognitive impairment and memory loss over time. Analyzing the diets and fat intake of 6,000 women, aged 65 and older, researchers found that those who frequently ate foods such as beef, butter, and processed snacks fared poorly on three cognitive-function tests administered over a span of four years. Conversely, women who consumed more foods containing monounsaturated fats, such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, demonstrated superior brainpower. "
BANNED ANTIBIOTICS FOUND IN IMPORTED SHRIMP,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/banned-antibiotics-found-in-imported-shrimp,"MAY 21, 2012","According to a new ABC News report, imported shrimp, which makes up 90 percent of the nation’s grocery-store shrimp, has fallen through the cracks of the US food-inspection system. The news outlet tested 30 samples of supermarket shrimp from across the country, and found that approximately 10 percent contained traces of illegal pharmaceuticals, including two suspected carcinogens and an antibiotic known to damage the immune system. Due to the massive influx of foreign shrimp, the Food and Drug Administration only inspects roughly two percent of the imported crustaceans. The FDA says it has a strict zero tolerance policy on banned antibiotics, and says the study’s sample size was too small for it to constitute a real food-safety threat. "
5 ASIAN COUNTRIES MAKING STRIDES FOR ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/5-asian-countries-making-strides-for-animals,"MAY 21, 2012","In Asia, the most headline-grabbing animal-welfare issues are those tied to thousands of years of tradition, which continue to inform many countries’ cultures surrounding the uses of animals and animal products. But as an economically powerful urban middle class emerges in both East and South Asia, cultural attitudes are beginning to shift, partially because of an increased access to world travel and Western influence. As a result, a heightened awareness of animal-welfare issues, coupled with the increasing acceptance of animals as companions, has led numerous citizens to rally against previously unquestioned practices. In fact, there’s never been a more critical time for Asian countries to explore issues of animal welfare. Meat consumption is at an all-time high in countries such as India and China, the latter of which now eats more than twice as much meat as American consumers, amounting to approximately a quarter of all meat produced worldwide. In light of the continent’s evolution toward a more animal-friendly atmosphere, here are five countries that have been at the heart of recent animal-welfare victories. China
In April, more than 200 animal-welfare advocates, responding to a viral call to action on social-media platform Weibo, congregated at a tollbooth in an effort to block a truck from transporting 580 dogs to a local slaughterhouse. Because eating dog meat remains an accepted—and legal—practice in China, the activists pooled their resources to buy the malnourished and neglected dogs from the shipper before sending them to a local shelter for care. Recently, similar attempts have skyrocketed: An estimated 2,000 dogs have been rescued in the past year alone, NPR reports, and in 2011, activists successfully shut down a centuries-old dog-eating festival after rigorous campaigning. Opposition to bear-bile farming dominated the headlines for weeks in February after Chinese celebrities such as basketball star Yao Ming spoke out against the practice of collecting bile from the gall bladders of living bears using metal tubes. The cruel industry, which places as many as 20,000 bears in captivity each year to gather their bile for medicine, is the focus of Cages of Shame, a film that chronicles the rescue of 10 bears, set to debut in September. Taiwan
The island of Taiwan, governed by the Republic of China, has made an effort in recent years to curb animal cruelty. Late last year, the country became the first in Asia to introduce legislation banning shark finning—the act of cutting off sharks’ fins and throwing them back to the water to die. The law was a response to local luxury hotels’ refusal to stop serving shark fin soup, a traditional meal favored by wealthy Chinese. Up to 73 million sharks die each year to satisfy the public’s appetite for the controversial soup, which remains associated with opulence in spite of global efforts to diminish its significance. In addition to shark finning, the Taiwanese government recently proposed a ban on mercy releases, a spiritual ritual during which Buddhists release captive animals into the wild in order to improve their karma. According to government officials, approximately 200 million animals, mostly birds and fish, are released annually. Facing unnatural habitats and a lack of food, few end up surviving. The government is currently in negotiations to finalize the ban, with support from animal-welfare and environmentalist organizations such as Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan and Humane Society International. Japan
Even in a country at the forefront of technological innovations, animal-welfare standards in Japan continue to lag. Academy Award-winning film The Cove educated millions about dolphin slaughter in Taiji, Japan, a village known for producing whale and dolphin meat. Following the success of the film, mounting concern over cetacean meat’s endurance in Japanese culture led hundreds of thousands of angry consumers to petition against its sale on amazon.com’s Japanese subsidiary in early 2012. The public outcry was effective: In March, soon after the media picked up the story, the online retailer removed the items, many of which reportedly came from endangered and protected species. More recently, the Japanese government passed an ordinance that bans the display of animals after 8pm. The country’s environment ministry created the law in response to a whopping 155,000 requests from Japanese consumers—a number French news agency Agence France-Presse called “unusually high … in politically ambivalent Japan.” The requests were mainly an effort to prohibit Tokyo pet shops from placing dogs and cats on display in cramped glass compartments well into the night. But to some animal-welfare advocates, a beneficial byproduct of the law is that it may derail Japan’s popular cat café industry, which enables customers to mingle with cats in a potentially stressful coffee shop environment. Indonesia
The Indonesian livestock-slaughter industry received a massive blow in the summer of 2011 after nonprofit Animals Australia captured undercover footage of Australian cows being brutally abused at an Indonesian slaughterhouse. According to ABC News, which broadcast the video, Indonesia is a central market for the export of Australian livestock, with 60 percent of the country’s cattle ending up in the Southeast Asian country. Uproar over the footage forced the Australian government to suspend cattle exports to Indonesia and implement tougher welfare standards. Though trade resumed a month later, Indonesia has had a difficult time recovering from the financially damaging effects of the ban. Still, according to animal-welfare advocates, there remains a lot of work to be done. Last week, Animals Australia released yet another video to the Agriculture Department depicting cruelty in Indonesian slaughterhouses, proving that government regulations have been weakly enforced. India
The largely vegetarian nation of India is no stranger to issues of animal welfare: In 1960, it became one of the first countries worldwide to enact legislation prohibiting animal cruelty, and the country’s constitution lists compassion toward all beings as a fundamental tenet. But some animal-welfare advocates are seeing a discrepancy between the country’s policies on paper and their reality in practice, and are urging the immediate adoption of the Animal Welfare Act of 2011. Proposed provisions of the measure include prioritizing animal birth control and improving the conditions for cattle being transported within the country.  Though the Animal Welfare Act of 2011 has yet to pass, its predecessor, 1960’s Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, served as the framework for groundbreaking new legislation banning the use of animals in dissection and scientific research. Effective this year, educational institutions, hospitals, and labs will be required to use research alternatives such as computer simulations and mannequins. The measure, which excludes new molecular research, represents an effort to avoid the unnecessary suffering of animals. As the animal-welfare movement continues to gain momentum in Asia, activists’ efforts will undoubtedly impact both the cultural understanding and legislative policy surrounding the treatment of animals. Perhaps, in time, welfare advocates will be able to reconcile their desire to preserve tradition with their goal of alleviating the suffering of all species.   Photo: Xaxor "

Salley announced yesterday that he has obtained an ownership position at the company, and will use his position to raise awareness about the often-nonvegan winemaking process. Vegan Vine Wines are produced by the Northern Californian winery Clos LaChance, which has ceased the usage of any animal products and now prides itself on its all-vegan varieties. “As both a vegan and wine lover, I was very surprised to learn about the use of animal products in the vinification process.

MISSOURI PASSES AG-GAG COMPROMISE LEGISLATION,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/missouri-passes-ag-gag-compromise-legislation,"MAY 20, 2012","Missouri lawmakers made a surprise decision this week, tabling proposed ag-gag legislation in favor of a less harsh, broad-reaching agriculture bill that includes some ag-gag provisions. Designed to placate both the farm industry and animal-welfare advocates, the approved legislation requires anyone with media depicting alleged animal abuse or worker misconduct to share their findings with law enforcement within 24 hours. It also toughens penalties for trespassing and gives farm owners the right to use justifiable force in the event of a break-in. The original ag-gag bill, which passed the House before moving to the Senate, would have criminalized the act of gaining access to a farm under false pretenses, and prohibited the act of recording or photographing agricultural operations without permission.

Officials from the archipelago, located approximately 150 miles from mainland Australia, announced plans to allocate $2.5 million of the state budget to animal-welfare initiatives, including phasing out the confining cages and accelerating efforts to ban pig gestation crates. The Tasmanian government says the move is a response to consumers’ increased sensitivity to animal-welfare issues. “The demand for locally produced eggs, particularly free range, is growing and the industry acknowledges this change and is eager to work with [the] government on a transition,” says Primary Industries Minister Bryan Green.

The plaintiffs, Animal Place, Farm Sanctuary, and Harvest Home Animal Sanctuary, were involved with rescue operations following the grisly discovery, which left one third of the birds dead, and thousands suffering from starvation and infection. Since all three organizations provided care to the 4,500 remaining birds, they are demanding that the owners, Andy Keung Cheung and Lien Diep, compensate them for the food and veterinary services required during the birds’ rehabilitation.

The Dallas Observer notes that many of its contemporaries—including Wendy’s, McDonald’s, Burger King, and even grocery giant Safeway—have all pledged in recent months to move away from the extremely confining facilities due to consumer demand and animal-welfare concerns, but Domino’s has opted to reject a proposal, put forth by the Humane Society of the United States, to follow suit. Mike Barnett, director of publications for the Texas Farm Bureau, praised the move on the group’s blog, commending the chain for “show[ing] some backbone,” but Dallas Observer writer Laura Drewes Daniels argues, “It’s not mere folly … People are starting to think more about where their food comes from.” "
STUDY: HEALTH FOOD NOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN JUNK FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/study-health-food-not-more-expensive-than-junk-food,"MAY 17, 2012","A new study from the US Department of Agriculture debunks the widespread argument that fresh, wholesome foods are more expensive than processed, high-calorie items. The study was intended as a counterpoint to a 2010 University of Washington study which found that junk food is more cost-efficient calorie-for-calorie. However, the new research demonstrates that when measured by weight or portion size rather than caloric content, fruit, vegetables and grains are actually less expensive than meat and foods with high levels of salt, sugar, and saturated fat. USDA scientist and study author Andrea Carlson argues, “Using price per calorie doesn’t tell you how much food you’re going to get or how full you are going to feel.” Other nutrition advocates also point out the issue of “empty calories,” which contribute to obesity and offer no health benefits.

The Lateline footage, captured at a facility close to Sydney, depicts multiple breaches of the country’s Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, prompting widespread outrage from both the public and government authorities. As a result, each slaughterhouse will now be required to hire a designated animal-welfare officer to oversee operations and ensure that workers are conducting themselves properly. However, some activists fear that the changes aren’t enough, particularly because hiring decisions will be made in-house. Instead, they are urging NSW officials to install closed-circuit cameras designed to provide constant surveillance. "

After experts determined that widely used neonicotinoid insecticides were causing colony collapse disorder—a worldwide phenomenon wherein honeybees die in mass quantities—Polish beekeepers and bee advocates circulated a petition to prohibit the country from using Mon810, which was modified to self-produce the popular insecticide. In response, the Polish government has banned the controversial crop, marking the first time a country has definitively acknowledged a link between Monsanto’s genetically modified foods and honeybees’ widespread collapse. Scientists say honeybees play a critical role in the pollination process, and their decline could threaten the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. "
USE OF DRUGS IN ETHANOL PRODUCTION INCITES CONCERN,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/use-of-drugs-in-ethanol-production-incites-concern,"MAY 14, 2012","Following last week’s story about the possible role of farm runoff in spreading superbugs, government officials are growing concerned over another overlooked and unregulated potential source of antibiotic resistance. Last week, members of Congress questioned the US Food and Drug Administration about ethanol byproducts’ antibiotic levels after a recent Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy report revealed that leftover distiller grains are routinely fed to livestock. Because ethanol producers have no restrictions on the quantity and frequency of antibiotic use during the fermentation process, farm animals may be consuming potentially hazardous amounts—a fact researchers say may threaten public health. In a letter to the FDA Commissioner, Representatives Ed Markey and Louise Slaughter ask for clarification regarding the agency’s apparent inaction surrounding the issue. "

REAL TALK WITH VEGAN IS LOVE’S RUBY ROTH,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/real-talk-with-vegan-is-loves-ruby-roth,"MAY 14, 2012","From The Washington Post to the Los Angeles Times, major news outlets all over the country have been talking about a new book—and the surprising part is that it’s a book for children. Vegan Is Love is the second book from artist-author Ruby Roth, who also penned 2009’s That’s Why We Don’t Eat Animals, aiming to educate youths about the positive impact that they can have on their health, the environment, and the well-being of animals through personal lifestyle choices. We caught up with Roth mid-media frenzy to hear her response to the controversy surrounding the book, her biggest influences, and the real reason why the veganism movement will only grow larger. VegNews: What initially inspired you to go vegan, and how does it overlap with your motives as an artist?
Ruby Roth: My veganism started as a health experiment about nine years ago, and that worked out really well. I tried it for a summer and I never went back. And I’ve always been an artist. I double majored in art and American studies. I was always interested politics and justice and the underbelly of American history and culture. And so when I decided to create this book, it seemed like the perfect melding of all of my interests. VN: What appealed to you about writing books for children, specifically?
RR: I think that it’s never too early to learn how our choices affect the public realm. I think with the state of our nation economically, environmentally, and with health, there’s no time to waste with teaching the next generation how to live consciously and healthfully. VN: What were some of the books that were most influential to you as a child?
RR: [That question is] very timely with Maurice Sendak’s recent passing … Where the Wild Things Are! That’s a big one. Margaret Wise Brown’s Goodnight Moon. My all-time favorite is The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf. I think it’s one of the most perfect books in the history of books, with the illustrations and the text. I literally have it on my nightstand. VN: How did the response to your first book, That’s Why We Don’t Eat Animals, compare to the response you’re experiencing with Vegan Is Love?
RR: They both received tremendous support and a worldwide audience, but at the same time, they both were on the receiving end of a lot of controversy as well. And I think with this book, Vegan Is Love, which has sparked this national discussion about children and veganism, we see that although plant-based diets are found throughout history and throughout the world, that the American public is not quite familiar with veganism in the mainstream. I expected some controversy, but I think that when I see people calling this book “scary,” what [Americans] are admitting on some level nationally is that what we do to animals is scary. So that shows that people want to remain willfully ignorant and impose that ignorance on their children. If it’s too scary to talk about then it’s certainly too scary to eat! They’re calling it graphic, but there’s nothing in the book that a child wouldn’t see walking through the grocery store at the deli section or in myriad TV shows about hunting and fishing or cooking, really. VN: It’s interesting that you mentioned that in America especially, this seems to be something that the mainstream is not comfortable with. Have you had the chance to talk to anyone from other parts of the world and see how they respond?
RR: I get emails from all over the world, but recently, for example, a Jain family came to my book signing, and [their religion has] been on a plant-based diet for centuries. They said that they could see some of their scriptures in my book. And we see people thriving on plant-based diets in Buddhism and Hinduism and Rastafarianism, and I think here in America where we’re so indoctrinated by the meat and dairy industries, it seems outrageous—and for some people, unheard of—to abandon the Standard American Diet. So there’s a lot of fear associated with the unknown of veganism. VN: How have you seen children responding to the book?
RR: I’ve read these books to hundreds, if not thousands, of kids, and I’ve never once seen a child feel overwhelmed. In fact, it’s been the opposite—they respond with insight, curiosity, and great ideas about how we can better protect animals and the environment and our own health. I find that when we give kids the information they need to make educated choices, they really choose wisely. VN: Studies have shown that for a lot of children, curiosity about animals and appreciation for animals is inherent. Why do you think people’s attitudes change as they grow out of childhood?
RR: I think that if the American public could take a look at the degree of collusion between our government, the US Department of Agriculture, big agriculture, and pharmaceuticals in getting us to abide by their guidelines and consume their products, then the outrage would really be directed at the meat and dairy industries. What you find is that these giant corporations have a huge hand in formulating the way that the American public thinks on a very organized and purposeful level. VN: You’ve received a lot of attention from the mainstream media, major news outlets that don’t always cover issues such as veganism in a positive light. Overall, what kind of experience would you say you’ve had with those media sources?
RR: Veganism is relatively new to the mainstream, so of course there are going to be questions raised. But I’m thrilled that there’s a discussion in national media because all of the questions have answers today and anything that anybody is curious about with the vegetarian or vegan diet can be accessed at the touch of a button. When I was a child I didn’t know the word “veganism.” At least now, we know the word well enough to argue about it. They say it takes about 20 years for the medical industry to catch up to what’s going on. So I think we’ll continue to see a big shift in American thinking. VN: When you were writing the book, did you find it difficult to translate some of the heavier issues to be appropriate for the perspective of a child?
RR: Yes. There is so much information, and I wanted to make sure to include the biggest tenants of veganism. I’ll use the animal testing page as an example. I made sure that everything was manageable for a child’s capacity. I think that adults forget what it’s like to see the world in the eyes of a child. When adults look at the animal-testing spread, and they see images of animals with wounds, we have a context for what that means—that reminds us of exposed organs and syringes and restraints. But when a kid looks at it, all they see are animals in cages with “ouchies,” and I think that’s a perfectly good jumping off point for a discussion about animal testing and what we can do to protect animals. I made sure to be very careful in my book, but I also feel strongly that we don’t have to sugarcoat or avoid the truth with children. I think that by sugarcoating or avoiding the truth with kids, we’re only hindering what they’re capable of. VN: What are you hoping to tackle next as an author and an artist?
RR: I have more books in mind, and I’m thrilled to have made a connection with vegan and vegetarian families around the world. I’m just going to keep writing and blogging, and just continue the path that I’ve put myself on. "
TAIWANESE GOVERNMENT PROPOSES BAN ON MERCY RELEASES,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/taiwanese-government-proposes-ban-on-mercy-releases,"MAY 14, 2012","The Taiwanese government is looking to ban mercy releases—a Buddhist rite during which people release captive animals into the wild in an effort to improve their karma and good fortune. According to French news agency Agence France-Presse, tens of millions of animals, largely consisting of birds and fish, die each year as a result of the spiritual ceremony, often due to lack of food and inhospitable habitats. Furthermore, Humane Society International argues that releasing animals into new environments can disrupt fragile ecosystems, causing species to compete for food and space and promoting the spread of disease. As a result, the government is proposing a law that would force individuals convicted of performing a mercy release to face up to two years of jail time or an $85,000 fine. "

According to a study conducted by scientists from the University of Colorado and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, the city’s smog contains ammonium nitrate—a gas that is formed when ammonia reacts with nitrogen oxides. Researchers say cows release approximately 33 to 176 tons of ammonia daily, as compared to 62 tons released by cars alone, making them a more substantial factor in smog emissions than previously thought. The California Dairy Industry remains skeptical of these findings, citing the study’s purported over-estimation of the number of cows in the region. "

In a new essay, Freston argues that factory-farm chickens possess a gene selected to boost weight gain and speed up production. The presence of this “obesity gene,” coupled with the chickens’ lack of exercise and high-calorie diet, has led to a tenfold increase in the birds’ fat content. In order to adhere to a heart-healthy and low-fat diet, Freston recommends getting protein from plant-based sources such as beans, tofu, and whole grains. "

The state-of-the-art facility will be tailored to deal with the unique health troubles farm animals face as a result of cruel agricultural practices. “It’s hard to see animals who are just a few months old suffering from heart disease and other ailments because they’ve been genetically engineered by the meat industry to grow bigger and faster than is natural,” says Farm Sanctuary Shelter Director Susie Coston.

VEGNEWS PRO/CON SERIES,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/vegnews-pro-con-series,"MAY 8, 2012","Pro/Con is a new web series here on VegNews.com that will focus on hot-button vegan issues. We’ll explore the trickier points of vegan living, and delve into where the community stands on potentially contentious questions. By allowing respondents to answer anonymously, we’ll get honest answers from around the country. First up: Fashion Grandfathering!
Veganism extends far beyond what does and doesn’t grace our dinner plates. Upon adopting a cruelty-free lifestyle, vegans are faced with many questions, including what to do with their wardrobe. Silk, leather, and wool are vegan no-nos, but does it make sense to get rid of clothing items purchased during pre-vegan days? Should non-vegan clothing get grandfathered into a compassionate closet? We asked vegans around the country to weigh in:

Pro: Keep Your Clothes
The money is spent. The animals who were used in the production of the clothes are likely long since departed, and by keeping the clothes we already own, we avoid needless consumerism. Just as we might hold on to a favorite tacky sweater or beloved pair of outdated acid-wash jeans, replacing the non-vegan items in our closets is wasteful and needless. Even producing a simple (and vegan) cotton T-shirt requires roughly a third of a pound of pesticides during production. Here’s what our interviewees had to say:

#1—“One aspect of the vegan lifestyle is conscious consumption, and waste is a deplorable thing, too, so unless the clothing is something egregious such as a fur coat or a leather jacket, I think using up your leather belt, wallet, and shoes until you need a new one is just fine. Many people don’t have the means to replace non-vegan items, so by no means should vegans be judging other vegans about their old belts. We’ve got much more important work to do.”

#2—“Transitioning to veganism is different for everyone, so you have to go with what makes you personally comfortable—and if you don’t have the means to buy all vegan items, add a piece at a time.”

#3—“It would be nice if answers to complex questions were black and white, but they’re not. Case in point, I still have (shudder!) a leather couch that was my ex-husband’s. I never would have bought a leather couch, even when I was just vegetarian, and I never liked it. But it’s still in decent condition—other than scratch marks from the cats. Do I toss this huge item in a landfill just because it’s not vegan?”

Con: Ditch the Duds
Wearing animal-derived clothing not only sends mixed messages about veganism (such as the idea that it’s OK to use animals for clothes, but not to eat them), but creates further demand for such items. If we truly believe that animals shouldn’t be used by humans, that choice should be reflected in everything we do. Plus, organizations such as Goodwill or Salvation Army will happily accept used clothing and redistribute it to people in need. Here’s what our interviewees had to say:

#1—“Even though wearing a leather belt you already have doesn’t result in the cows who died for that belt being hurt any more than they already were when they were killed for it, by wearing leather or animal products, you are still showing the outside world that it is okay to exploit animals. So eventually, over the course of, say, a year, the leather belt—and shoes, purses, wallets, etc.—should be replaced with cruelty-free alternatives. After the year, the grace period is over.”

#2—“It’s really up to personal choice and what you can feel good about, but if you’re representing veganism I say why not do it from head to toe!”

#3—“No. Sell them on eBay and use the money to buy new eco vegan items (or donate to animal-rights organizations). Unless the pieces have sentimental value, in which case save and wear.” Where do you stand? Should all non-vegan clothing items be tossed? Is it appropriate to wear out wallets and belts? Let us know in the comments! "

The intensely confining cages have recently received mainstream media attention due to being disavowed by major food conglomerates such as Hormel, Smithfield, Burger King, and Wendy’s. Although Safeway has been gradually sourcing more from gestation crate-free facilities, it announced its official goal to have a crate-free supply chain and is currently “formulating plans to determine how it can reach that goal,” according to Brian Dowling, the company’s vice president of public affairs.

USDA TO ALLOW CHICKEN INDUSTRY TO SELF-REGULATE,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/usda-to-allow-chicken-industry-to-self-regulate,"MAY 7, 2012","Last month, the US Department of Agriculture revealed plans to lay off roughly 1,000 poultry-plant inspectors over the next three years in hopes of increasing efficiency and modernizing the industry, but activists express concern that chicken-processing companies cannot be trusted to regulate their own operations without compromising food safety and quality control. While the USDA would be saving roughly $85 million through the move, poultry companies would also be permitted to increase the speed of their processing lines from 90 birds per minute to 175, increasing the risk of foodborne disease, covert tumors, and other potential contaminants. Government-accountability group OMB Watch, for example, points out that 2010 showed record highs in salmonella infection, and in 2011, there were 103 poultry, egg, and meat recalls due to bacterial contamination.

Citing a report from the World Bank Group’s environmental advisor Robert Goodland and co-author Jeff Anhang, the article mentions the possible positive effects that replacing meat and dairy with plant-based products could have, including helping to reduce livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions, lessening agriculture’s dependence on oil, and alleviating a worldwide water shortage. Only one fourth of the most environmentally taxing products need to be replaced to meet international climate goals, according to Goodland, which he sees as a major opportunity for food companies to offer more eco-friendly, plant-based items.

MARYLAND BANS THE USE OF ARSENIC IN CHICKEN FEED,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/maryland-bans-the-use-of-arsenic-in-chicken-feed,"MAY 3, 2012","In a historic decision, Maryland has become the first state to ban the use of arsenic in chicken feed. The new law, which passed after being introduced in the state legislature for three consecutive years, gained momentum after a University of Maryland report revealed that the presence of the toxic substance in feed was contaminating local waterways. An estimated 70 percent of broiler chickens—chickens raised for meat—were fed arsenic in 2011, a practice designed to boost growth and maintain chickens’ commercially viable pink hue. As a result, more than 25,000 pounds of the chemical compound have been introduced into Maryland’s air and water. Inorganic arsenic is considered a Class A carcinogen, and has been linked to life-threatening illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. "

"DISLIKING PORK MAY BE DUE TO GENE SEQUENCE, SCIENTISTS SAY",https://vegnews.com/2012/5/disliking-pork-may-be-due-to-gene-sequence-scientists-say,"MAY 3, 2012","There are numerous ethical and health reasons for giving up pork, but according to a new study published in science journal PLos One, having an aversion to the meat may actually be genetic. Investigating the relationship between odor perception and food preferences, scientists have identified a gene that determines whether androstenone—a compound similar to testosterone found in male pigs—smells offensive or sweet. Because many male pigs in the US and Europe are castrated prior to slaughter, few consumers are currently exposed to androstenone. However, in light of the European Union considering a ban on the cruel practice, researchers say more consumers could soon find themselves with a sudden distaste for male pig meat. "
BAN ON PIG CRATES COULD DECREASE EU PORK SUPPLY,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/ban-on-pig-crates-could-decrease-eu-pork-supply,"MAY 2, 2012","The European Union’s tightened animal-welfare regulations may derail its prosperous pork industry, Reuters reports. According to EU farming officials, the Union-wide ban on pig gestation crates, effective in 2013, could cause pig herd numbers to drop by as much as 10 percent. Officials predict that many farmers will have a hard time complying with the new rules, due to financial or geographical constraints, resulting in multiple farms shutting down operations. A 10 percent drop in pig numbers could have a serious impact on the pork industry: Pork prices could increase significantly as countries face pork shortages, and exports could diminish. The European Union is currently the second-largest pork exporter in the world. "
CRUISE LINE LAUNCHES EXTENSIVE ALL-VEGETARIAN MENU,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/cruise-line-launches-extensive-all-vegetarian-menu,"MAY 2, 2012","Holland America is changing the cruise-cuisine game by unveiling a new all-vegetarian menu for its entire 15-ship fleet, offering 22 vegetarian and vegan dishes on its special menu and an additional 30 on its main dining room menu.

A few of the new choices for plant-loving passengers include Curried Vegetable Empanadas, Spicy Lentil and Garbanzo Salad, and Grilled Vegetable and Tofu Kebobs. "
9 FAUX MEATS THAT YOU HAVE TO TRY TO BELIEVE,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/9-faux-meats-that-you-have-to-try-to-believe,"MAY 2, 2012","Pop into any major supermarket this days, and you are virtually guaranteed to find meat-free deli slices and frozen veggie burgers. But did you know that there are many more offbeat “meats” on the market? Should you decide to whip up a more exotic meal than a Tofurky sandwich, options abound for vegan versions of everything from calamari to foie gras. Next time you want to take a walk on the wild side, try one of these nine quirky re-creations. Calamari
Some love rubbery rings of squid, while others are squeamish about the idea of eating a tentacled sea monster. Either way, vegan calamari awaits the meatless seafood spread at your next dinner party. Sophie’s Kitchen has come up with a convenient breaded version that is also soy-free, so bust out the cocktail sauce and celebrate the fact that you’ve saved a thankful squid! Caviar
Looking to class up a cocktail party but not really interested in eating fish or their dang eggs? For less than a third of the price of the real deal, bust out Aqua Gourmet’s Sea Pearls (that’s right, perles de mer) for a taste of luxury that comes from healthful kelp instead of sad little fishies. For an extra touch of class, try the truffle flavor!  Duck
Asian supermarkets can be treasure troves for fake meat, and one of our faves is plant-based Peking duck. Sweet, juicy, and satisfying, this wheat-based meat sub by Companion is awesome in stir-fries, sandwiches, and bánh mì. And best of all, it’s cruelty-free as can be. Foie Gras
While foie gras is inarguably considered one of the cruelest of luxuries, its rich flavor continues to be sought out by many foodies. Thankfully, compassionate and resourceful companies have made efforts to mimic its taste without causing suffering or using any animal products. The New York-based Regal Vegan has concocted Faux Gras, a walnut- and lentil-based substitute that is not only tastier, but also considerably healthier than its calorie-heavy counterpart. On its website, the brand explains that Faux Gras is “not meant to replace goose or duck liver, which is undoubtedly one of the cruelest foods on the market today, Faux Gras is meant to give people with a sophisticated palate a treat that isn’t harmful. To anyone.” More affordable soy-based patés also exist, such as Vitalia’s formula. Haggis
That’s right. The traditional Scottish dish of assorted seasoned sheep organs (sorry that you even had to read that) is actually available in plant-based form. And even more surprisingly, there are several companies that have reproduced the divisive delicacy for veg haggis enthusiasts. Portland’s Food Fight Grocery carries the canned stuff, and for a mere $7.50, the tastes of Edinburgh can be yours. Caledonian Kitchen and Macsween also make plant-based haggis, with the latter presented in a loaf eerily resembling the real thing. Lamb Vindaloo
While vegan lamb in its unseasoned form is highly elusive, its Indian rendition, Lamb Vindaloo, is readily available courtesy of Vegetarian Plus. Whether you’ve ever had the real thing or not, this dish is pretty tasty, combining earthy mushrooms with hearty soy and a plethora of Eastern spices to attain a frozen entrée that’s worthy of your dinner slot. And speaking of Vegetarian Plus and its wide catalog of faux meats, read on to hear about their plant-based shrimp! Mahi Mahi
Vegan tuna? Old news. (Although vegan tuna salad, we love you forever.) How about a meatless mahi mahi filet? Veggie Brothers’ pre-grilled “fish steaks” aim to evoke the aroma of the sea, presented in a classic lemon-garlic sauce. This small-scale company individually cooks every product by hand to achieve the most delicious and realistic fish alternative possible. Jury’s out on this one… Scallops
Like shrimp, scallops are no longer off limits to those abstaining from animal products. In fact, you may find yourself having to choose between Worthington’s “Skallops” or Cedar Lake’s Vegi-Scallops when you’re in the mood for bouillabaisse or Seafood Mac and Cheese. Or, try them breaded and pan-fried with margarine and a squeeze of lemon. Shrimp
Shrimp, with their pinkish hue and somewhat unique texture, are undoubtedly more difficult to mimic with veg ingredients than most other meats. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be done! Vegetarian Plus has managed to make plant-based prawns that even sport the orange stripes of their aquatic inspirations. A peek at the ingredients list can be a little puzzling—top ingredients include curdlan gum, refined konjac powder, and modified tapioca starch. But hey, we’re not the wizards who whip up this stuff—we’re just here to eat. These faux meats are just a few of the many creations that are available—or soon to be available—on the market. With this many options for satisfying substitutes, why go back to the real stuff ever again? Stick to the stand-ins, for your health, the environment, and the animals. "

Compassionate eatery Frisch has turned to the crowdsourced fundraising platform in the hope of obtaining $8,000 for kitchen renovations and appliances, as well as for initial food purchases from local farms. The up-and-coming, low-waste restaurant has already secured a location in a historical Salt Lake City building, where it plans to dole out delicious dishes such as Kale and Mushroom Frittatas, Enlightened Egg Salad, and Gluten-Free Almond Butter Crispies.

FARM AND FOOD INDUSTRIES FIGHT ANIMAL-CRUELTY BILLS,https://vegnews.com/2012/5/farm-and-food-industries-fight-animal-cruelty-bills,"MAY 1, 2012","Despite legislative victories in the realm of animal cruelty, members of the factory farming and food industries continue to challenge voter-approved initiatives in California. Four years after the state passed Proposition 2, which requires farmers to eliminate the use of gestation crates and battery cages by 2015, egg farmer William Cramer has filed a lawsuit arguing that the proposition is unconstitutional. Cramer, whose farm Norco Ranch was the subject of a 2008 Mercy for Animals investigation, says the measure could destroy the industry. Similarly, more than 100 chefs are protesting the state’s upcoming ban on the sale of foie gras, citing a high customer demand for the delicacy. The chefs are urging the state legislature to revoke the ban and create what they call “humane” foie-gras production standards instead. "

Mathers, who also entered two savory sandwiches in the competition, is offering the recipe for her winning creation on COK’s blog.

"WILLIAMSBURG, BROOKLYN’S 9 HOTTEST VEGAN-FRIENDLY EATERIES",https://vegnews.com/2012/5/williamsburg-brooklyns-9-hottest-vegan-friendly-eateries,"MAY 1, 2012","New York City’s East Village, featured in our May+June issue, may get all the (deliciously deserved) hype, but hop on an L train heading to Brooklyn and you’ll soon be privy to Williamsburg’s vast selection of cruelty-free eats. With its bustling bar scene, packed musical venues, and fashion-forward residents, this undeniably hip locale has established itself as one of Kings County’s cultural capitals, so it’s no surprise that some of the best vegan grub in the Tri-State area lurks behind its crumbling brick facades. If you don’t have your hands on our current issue, check out these nine Williamsburg eateries (including a brewery) that’ll have you clamoring across the bridge into this buzz-worthy borough. Bliss Café
For those seeking a lighter meal, Bliss Café serves wholesome meals in a sunny, casual setting. This unpretentious vegetarian eatery has opted to ditch the highly processed fake meats that dominate other veg menus in favor of fresh, lightly seasoned veggies, whole grains, and house-made protein patties. Locals love the café’s Harvest Plate, a brown rice bowl topped with sautéed mixed vegetables, lentils, and tofu or tempeh—all smothered in your choice of dressing. Bliss isn’t entirely vegan—some dishes contain egg and dairy—but cruelty-free substitutes abound at this homey locale. Brooklyn Brewery
Since it was founded in 1988, Brooklyn Brewery has been doling out quality craft beers, the vast majority of which are vegan-friendly. The company prides itself on using cruelty-free Biofine Clear solution to filter its brews, unlike many companies, which use animal products. But there are a few exceptions—the brewery’s Brooklyn Local 2 and Brooklyn BAMboozle beers, along with several past Brewmaster’s Reserve drinks, contain honey. Regardless, vegans have a rotating roster of libations to enjoy. Plus, the brewery encourages patrons to bring in outside food, so you can chow down as you drink up. Champs Family Bakery
From the ashes of much-loved Brooklyn sandwich joint Boneshakers comes Champs Family Bakery, offering baked goods and classic comfort food worthy of its diner décor. Its recently revamped menu features greasy spoon standards such as a club sandwich and tuna melt, along with healthier fare such as the gluten-free Awesome Bowl, packed full of quinoa, greens, and scrambled tofu. Champs also serves up breakfast basics such as vegan pancakes and tofu-eggs on toast, so you can indulge in the most important meal of the day even if it’s dinnertime. Dun-Well Doughnuts
Vegans and omnivores alike can agree that Dun-Well Doughnuts’ holey indulgences are the top of the line. Even NY Daily News has weighed in, crowning the doughnut shop the best in town. The brainchild of buddies Christopher Hollowell and Dan Dunbar, DunWell is well on its way to fulfilling its mission of being “the premier vegan doughnut shop on planet Earth,” using a revised family recipe to craft inventive, artisan treats. The menu rotates, but past flavors include cruelty-free Cadbury Cream Egg, Green Tea and Ginger, and Maple Bourbon, best washed down with a sip of Brooklyn Egg Cream soda. Foodswings
Whoever said vegans don’t like junk food has obviously never been to Foodswings—a mecca for all things salty, savory, and generously fried. The buffalo-style drumsticks have reached legendary proportions, especially when paired with the restaurant’s vegan bleu cheese. With a menu featuring nine different types of French fries (Disco Fries included) and more than 15 milkshake combos, Foodswings may not help you get swimsuit-ready for summer, but it will greatly increase your threshold for face-stuffing—after all, one veggie drumstick is never enough. LA Burrito
Ever-protective of their unofficial state dish, many California transplants argue that New York burritos are just not up to par. However, LA Burrito gets an ‘A’ for effort, with delicious wraps containing the hallmarks of any traditional burrito. This burrito joint has made an effort to accommodate its vegan patrons, placing soy cheese and tofu sour cream alongside typical Mexican fixin’s such as salsa, beans, and guacamole. And if their burritos aren’t your bag, the restaurant offers jam-packed salad made with a variety of fresh veggies, tossed in vegan Caesar dressing. Pine Box Rock Shop
Pine Box Rock Shop, which straddles the Williamsburg-Bushwick border, is an all-vegan bar with rock ‘n’ roll flair. Married duo and seasoned musicians Jeff and Heather Rush, both vegan, opened the bar in 2010, converting a former casket factory into an acclaimed watering hole. In addition to its veg-friendly beers and cocktails—its fish-free Bloody Mary is said to blow others out of the water—the bar hosts the bi-monthly Vegan Shop-Up, New York City’s only all-vegan pop-up market. Vinnie’s Pizzeria
Pizzerias are a dime a dozen in Brooklyn, but finding one with great vegan options can be more of a challenge. Lucky for us, Vinnie’s Pizzeria aims to please, going the extra mile with its special vegan menu. Vinnie’s offers not one but two types of vegan cheese (Teese and Daiya) in its internationally inspired specialty slices. Culinary concoctions include the Spicy Slicey, a piquant combo of jalapeños, spicy chicken chunks, hot sauce, and cheese, and the Black Bean Taco, made with Mexican-style meat, fresh salsa, cheese, and beans. Wild Ginger
With its vast vegan menu and emphasis on fresh ingredients, Wild Ginger is the antidote to greasy, carb-loaded Chinese takeout. Proteins are the star of this pan-Asian eatery, with ingredients ranging from vegan seafood to soy fillets. For a filling main dish, choose the Black Pepper Seitan, a much-loved concoction that couples the savory wheat meat with Chinese broccoli. But don’t forget to save room for dessert—diners rave about the Peanut Butter Bomb, a towering peanut-butter confection coated in a hard chocolate shell.   Photo: Le New Yorking "

NPR DISCUSSES THE CHALLENGES OF MAKING VEGAN CHEESE,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/npr-discusses-the-challenges-of-making-vegan-cheese,"APRIL 30, 2012","With new and reformulated faux-meat products becoming increasingly close to the real thing, the market for cruelty-free foods is thriving. However, it may take a bit longer for vegan cheese to catch up to its flesh-free counterpart. According to NPR, food scientists are working diligently in an effort to replicate the taste and texture of dairy cheese. “It melts, spreads and becomes creamy. To try to duplicate that is to say we’re duplicating nature,” says food scientist Kantha Shelke. Though experts are beginning to develop products that mimic cheese’s natural qualities—notably Galaxy Nutritional Foods and Daiya, whose stretchy shreds have become a vegan staple—some believe there still remains a lot of work to do. “We’re coming close but we haven’t done it yet,” says Shelke.

Late last week, authorities raided the farm of Jay Williams, who reportedly supplies meat to local families, as part of an Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals investigation. The most recent investigation of Williams’ farm, which began in March, revealed animals living in deplorable conditions, with many suffering from malnutrition, dehydration, and infection. This latest incident marks Williams’ third time facing animal cruelty charges—the 60-year-old finished serving a 180-day sentence for a prior conviction last year. While the rescued animals are expected to make a full recovery, officials involved in the case are working to bar Williams from ever purchasing animals again. "

The study, which appears in the British Journal of Developmental Psychology, says that, when given the choice between playing with animals or attractive new toys, children spent more time with the animals—even those that many adults consider scary, such as spiders or snakes. Children also asked more questions and gestured more in the presence of animals, showing greater interest. Researchers say the results of the study suggest that children benefit from having companion animals in their lives. “Our research develops the idea that animals may be a good instrument for learning,” says Vanessa LoBue, who helped with the study.

THE 11 BEST DISHES IN LA’S HOTTEST VEG-FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/the-11-best-dishes-in-las-hottest-veg-friendly-neighborhood,"APRIL 24, 2012","Named for the man-made reservoir that it surrounds, Los Angeles’ Silverlake area is known as being one of the city’s most progressive and kooky neighborhoods. A hodgepodge of cultures, it offers sunny coexistence for hippies, artists, musicians, yogis, and dog-walkers, as well as hosts a bevy of Mexican, Thai, and Filipino restaurants. With forward-thinking individuals and a mix of cultures comes great cuisine, and as a result, Silverlake and neighboring Echo Park are excellent areas for noshing on enticing vegan food of all styles and calibers. We asked some local experts to share their favorite plant-based palate-pleasers, and here are the 11 dishes that shined the brightest. 1. Buffalo-style Cauliflower from Mohawk Bend
Who knew cauliflower could be so cool? Subdue the spice of this veg-friendly eatery’s buffalo sauce by slathering on the accompanying vegan blue cheese dressing, and wash it all down with a brewski from the seemingly endless beer list. 2. Mock Duck Curry from Bulan Thai
This all-veg Thai restaurant delivers Eastern heat with mouthwatering specials galore. Our pick: the Mock Duck Curry, wherein slightly sweet veggie duck complements coconut milk, tomatoes, bell peppers, chili, and, of course, curry spices. 3. Vegan Hawaiian Pizza from Cruzer
Priding itself on being LA’s only 100-percent vegan pizzeria, Cruzer doesn’t skimp in any department. Vegan cheese pizza isn’t too hard to come by, but vegan Hawaiian with meatless ham, pineapple, and Daiya cheese? We’re sold. 4. Caesar Salad from Cru
Missing the cool crunch of the quintessential Caesar? Cru’s got the best plant-based version in town, richened by cheesy sesame croutons, buttery avocado, and a cashew-coconut Caesar dressing that knocks the store-bought stuff out of the water. 5. Tempeh Reuben from Flore
Reubens are a popular choice for sandwich veganization, but Flore hits the nail on the head with its tempeh rendition. Bonus components include scrumptious sauerkraut, two kinds of cheese (cashew- and tofu-based), and thousand-island dressing. Don’t forget extra napkins. 6. Vegan Club Sandwich from Local
This airy lunch spot makes sure to cheers its veg patrons, and what better way to indulge us than with a triple-decker club sandwich piled high with tempeh, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and sunflower sprouts, and smeared with tofu-shallot mayo? 7. Acapulco Bowl from Tribal Café
This healthy take on a tostada resembles a deconstructed wonder burrito that you can chow down on with a fork. Fill your belly with brown cilantro rice, greens, black beans, lettuce, carrots, corn, guacamole, and salsa fresca, and add soy pepper-beef for a hearty extra. Be sure to ask for the vegan version so that your server knows to skip the sour cream. 8. Mac and Cheese Balls from Sage
Need we say more? Fried vegan macaroni-and-cheese slathered in even more cheese, and best when doused with a bit of hot sauce. Serve to omnis for maximum gloating as they scarf sans complaints. 9. Chocolate Salted Caramel Ice Cream from Kind Kreme
Sage’s sweet neighbor specializes in gourmet raw, vegan, organic frozen treats, and the almond milk-based Chocolate Salted Caramel Ice Cream is rich, creamy, and decadent enough to hurt so good. It’s dessert minus the dairy hangover. 10. Fresh Citrus Kale Salad from Elf Café
While myriad mouthwatering options await at this super vegan-friendly eatery, the Fresh Citrus Kale Salad is the perfect healthy, refreshing meal for a hot summer’s day. Avocado, hemp seeds, and oil-free tamari dressing make it as hearty as it is nourishing. 11. Tom Kha Vege from Vegan House
We love the flavors of Thailand, but it can be difficult to avoid sneaky animal ingredients like fish sauce and shrimp paste at many Thai restaurants. Thankfully, Vegan House offers totally plant-based versions of every dish imaginable, impressing us with this veggie-packed version of Tom Kha Gai soup.  "
SECOND CUSTOMER COLLAPSES AT HEART ATTACK GRILL,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/second-customer-collapses-at-heart-attack-grill,"APRIL 24, 2012","Just two months after a similar incident occurred, a second diner has collapsed mid-meal at Las Vegas’ Heart Attack Grill. According to local news outlet Fox5, the woman, who was reportedly eating the diner’s fatty fare while smoking and drinking alcohol, suffered an unspecified medical emergency, requiring immediate hospitalization. Owner John Basso maintains that his restaurant’s food wasn’t the sole contributor to the woman’s medical troubles. “I would say that this woman had given her body every single thing it would handle and the body finally gave out,” Basso says. The controversial eatery first made headlines in February after a customer suffered a heart attack while eating its famed Triple Bypass Burger—a one-and-a-half pound sandwich containing three beef patties. "
VEGAN WOMEN OF COLOR BREAK NEW GROUND,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/vegan-women-of-color-break-new-ground,"APRIL 23, 2012","Like many of the countercultural, socio-political movements that preceded it—in the US, the second wave of feminism and the student-led anti-Vietnam War movement come to mind—veganism has been represented as a predominately white phenomenon. As one Philadelphia Inquirer writer put it in a February 2012 article, “I’ve been told, straight-faced, that ‘black vegans’ are nonexistent, since the ‘veggie’ thing is just spoiled white college kids acting out.” Media over-exposure of the movement’s key white figures has further perpetuated this illusion, rendering vegans of color virtually invisible in our cultural landscape. However, mainstream media outlets are slowly starting to take note of the rich diversity already present within this multifaceted movement. Earlier this year, the Philadelphia Inquirer published the aforementioned article, titled “African Americans are Indeed in the Vegan Mix,” just weeks before BET ran a story reminding its audience that “Black People Are Vegan, Too!” Oakland, CA-based vegan chef and eco-activist Bryant Terry, whose work centers on revitalizing the African American tradition of eating home-grown, plant-based foods, received widespread media coverage in outlets such as The Huffington Post, NPR, and O, The Oprah Magazine after his latest book, The Inspired Vegan, hit the shelves. Likewise, vegan lifestyle guru Latham Thomas, founder of Tender Shoots Wellness and MamaGlow, has been featured on programs such as The Dr. Oz Show and Inside Edition. The presence of these and other vegan advocates has increased mainstream awareness of inextricably intertwined issues such as race, food, health, and ethics. Gender, too, is tied to vegan identity, due to the subtly (or sometimes not-so-subtly) ways in which various foods are associated with masculinity and femininity. Remember when Tea-Partier Herman Cain told GQ that vegetable pizza is “sissy”?—a sentiment echoed in fellow men’s magazine Esquire, whose beer-soaked Eat Like a Man food blog was repackaged as a meat-laden cookbook last year. Let’s not forget the veritable sausage fests broadcast on TV sets throughout the country as meat companies and fast-food joints peddle products to consumers. Needless to say, the feminization of the plant-based diet is hardly a new topic, but one that has seldom been analyzed with race, class, sexual orientation, and other social-justice issues in mind—at least not in mainstream publications. But the world of veganism is rich with women of color who, acutely aware of the ways in which systems of oppression impact their daily lives, are combining animal-welfare advocacy with other forms of activism in an effort to prove that no issue stands alone. Creating Community
When black feminist scholar A. Breeze Harper first read Sacred Woman by Queen Afua, a pioneering figure in the Afrikan Holistic Health movement, she ditched meat and dairy for good within a few days. Her newly adopted vegan diet, guided by Queen Afua’s emphasis on raw foods, was a far cry from the one she had maintained as an Dartmouth undergraduate, when she turned to cheeseburgers and other animal-product-laden foods to cope with what she felt was the university’s oppressive environment. Unlike her prior perception of veganism, which she associated with her obliviously disrespectful Dartmouth classmates, Queen Afua’s version offered a framework she could relate to—one that was seeped in the customs of her African ancestors. As she continued to embrace her dietary choice, Harper felt increasingly alienated as a woman of color in the vegan community. Ever proactive, she took to online forums to see if other vegan women felt the same: It turned out they did. Her call for essays about the black, female vegan experience led to 30 enthusiastic responses, covering everything from nutrition to hair care. Harper compiled these papers into Sistah Vegan, the first book to deconstruct the politics of veganism from a black feminist perspective. Sistah Vegan Project, an online continuation of the book, borrows from Queen Afua’s philosophies, but takes into account the complexity of identity. “I created the Sistah Vegan Project for women of African descent who may have benefited from some aspects of the Afrikan Holistic Health community, but feel marginalized because they don’t fit into that community’s rubric of what a true black female should be—straight, partnered with a black male, and not engaging in feminism,” Harper says. “It looks at how race operates in veganism through the experiences of black female subjects. But it’s not just looking at race, because race doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it’s influenced by all these different factors such as age, class, region, and sexual orientation.” What has emerged from Harper’s work is a comprehensive, all-inclusive community that uses academic theory as well as lived experience to understand and combat intersecting forms of oppression—such as speciesism, sexism, racism, homophobia, and classism—all of which remain bound together as long as the others exist. Food: The Common Ground
While Harper focuses on the politics of food from a black feminist and Afrikan Holistic Health perspective, Food Empowerment Project founder Lauren Ornelas approaches veganism from an equally multifaceted framework: One that supports animal welfare while also engaging with various social-justice projects. Her organization, which works to expose the inequalities inherent in our food-production systems, was launched in an effort to address the interrelated issues she discovered during her lengthy career as an animal-welfare activist. “I saw that all of the issues I cared so passionately about were all connected by food: animals, farm workers, corporate exploitation, the environment, immigration,” she says. “As much as I have dedicated every aspect of my life to veganism, I have found it to be impossible to just focus on that one issue.” Food Empowerment Project’s central campaigns include exploring notions of “food deserts” and investigating the horrors of the cacao industry. These projects aim to demonstrate how even well-meaning vegans (as well as omnivores) are implicated in unjust practices when it comes to food. “How can we say vegan chocolate is cruelty-free just because it doesn’t contain animal products? If it comes from the blood and sweat of slaves in West Africa —children, no less—it’s certainly not cruelty-free,” she says. The Impact of Uniting Issues
Harper and Ornelas’ backgrounds and approaches may differ, but the two agree that sometimes the harshest critics of their work are fellow vegans who, rather than viewing their efforts as an attempt at dismantling oppression for the benefit of all beings, feel they are being divisive and detracting from ethical veganism’s ultimate goal: to end the suffering of animals. Harper describes being met with disapproval during her search for Sistah Vegan contributors. “The moderator had posted what I was looking for and five or six white-identified vegans were so upset that I was looking at race and gender,” Harper says. “They made it clear that they thought race and gender had nothing to do with animal rights or veganism, that I was playing the race card, and they proceeded to basically bash the idea.” It’s an experience Ornelas shares. “It seems that some vegans don’t quite see the value of what we are doing when it comes to the big picture,” she says. “Since we don’t only talk about the suffering of animals in food production, but we also talk about the workers and slave labor, some people seem hesitant to give us as much support.” Still, both women have found that many vegans have been highly receptive to their approach to the cause, and understand that discussions about these issues are relevant to the vegan movement. In fact, one could argue that projects such as Harper and Ornelas actually attract more people to the cause because they enable members of marginalized groups to learn about a diet from which they may have felt excluded in the absence of these resources. Ornelas says women of color in particular have been appreciative of her message and, according to Harper, Sistah Vegan and its offshoot projects have been successful in reaching out to people of diverse backgrounds, regardless of how they have been received by critics. “I get emails or, if I do a talk, I’ll get people coming up to me—usually people of African descent—saying, ‘I always thought veganism had nothing to do with my experience as a person of color. You offered it to me in a way that I had never seen it before, and now I’m seeing all the connections.’”   Photo: Latham Thomas in Experience Life "
VEGANS RESPOND TO CONTROVERSY OVER VEG PARENTING,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/vegans-respond-to-controversy-over-veg-parenting,"APRIL 23, 2012","Vegan parenting has been at the center of media controversy this past week, with author Ruby Roth taking heat for her new pro-vegan children’s book Vegan is Love, set for release today. Roth’s book has been the subject of criticism, with some questioning the safety and suitability of her message. Further igniting the media firestorm is food writer Nina Planck, who warned against what she feels are the dangers of raising children vegan in last week’s New York Times Room for Debate feature. In the wake of the controversy, vegans are using the media to speak out against misinformation. In a Los Angeles Times blog post published yesterday, vegan dietitian and author Virginia Messina defends vegan parenting, urging readers to “rely on input from those experts, not on the views of uninformed food writers.” "

The organization is accusing the pork industry of using false advertising to deceive consumers about the welfare of pigs—a practice it says is in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. According to HSUS, the National Pork Producers Council’s public claims about its animal-welfare initiatives contradict known information about the routine abuse of sows on factory farms. “Rather than investing in real animal-welfare reforms, the Pork Council is betting the farm on a deceptive PR campaign designed to mislead consumers with false assurances,” says Jonathan Lovvorn, HSUS’ senior vice president for animal-protection litigation.

9 NEW WAYS TO USE NUT BUTTERS,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/9-new-ways-to-use-nut-butters,"APRIL 17, 2012","It used to be that peanut butter was the only game in town, but the “PB” of PB&J has some serious competition. The vast array of almond, cashew, and even walnut butters hitting the shelves, not to mention new flavor combinations such as cinnamon-raisin swirl peanut butter or chocolate sunflower seed almond butter—it’s enough to send our gourmet-goodie making minds into a frenzy. Baked into a cookies, blended into a new salad dressing, or layered between chocolate in a pie, you can literally create any flavors you want with a scoop of flavored nut butter. Here are some new contenders for your next PB&J—and beyond! 1. Spring Asparagus Salad with White Chocolate Peanut Butter Mustard Dressing
We are huge fans of Peanut Butter & Co’s White Chocolate Wonderful spread because vegan white chocolate is truly wonderful. Since we usually stir this spread into our oatmeal, or eat it straight out of the jar (after all, the company suggests it), we’re totally intrigued by using it in a savory dish like this fresh asparagus and cherry tomato salad. 2. Peanut Butter Cup Pie
There is no better pairing than chocolate and peanut butter and this pie features a peanut butter crust with chocolate pudding filling (aka heaven). We suggest using Earth Balance’s new Creamy Peanut and Coconut Spread since the addition of coconut would make this pie even richer. 3. Crispy Peanut Tofu
It’s time to go savory with the original nut butter. VN columnist Hannah Kaminsky, while known for her sweet side, takes Betty Lou’s Powdered Peanut Butter and whips up tofu triangles with a garlicky ginger peanut sauce. The peanut butter powder also doubles as a great addition for smoothies or for making PB when you want a little extra protein on the go. 4. One-Minute Almond Butter Banana Oatmeal
We like one-minute breakfasts, especially when you add in almond butter and banana slices to good-for-you oatmeal. Mix in Barney Butter Almond Butter, a spread that’s completely smooth and made in a peanut-free facility, and then go about your busy day. 5. No Bake Cocoa Cookies
Even easier than one-minute breakfasts are no-bake cookies, which only require blending all the ingredients in a food processor. This recipe uses Nuttzo Seven Nut and Seed Butter, packed with peanuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, flax seeds, and sunflower seeds, so these cookies are seven kinds of tasty (and healthy!). 6. Nutella Fudge Pops
Are your minds blown? Ours are. Blogger Chocolate Covered Katie uses only five ingredients to create these swoon-worthy popsicles that shouldn’t be reserved strictly for summer. A French company, Noiseraie Productions, makes a vegan version of Nutella called Choc & Nut made with hazelnut, cashews, and cocoa that would be perfect in this frozen confection. 7. Chocolate Peanut Butter Rice Crispy Bars
Remember when you thought giving up gelatin-filled marshmallows meant the end of a childhood favorite—rice crispy treats? With blogger Namely Marly’s revamped version, crispy combines with a peanut butter cup to make one delicious bar. If you want to raise the bar on this recipe, try Wild Squirrel’s Chocolate Coconut Peanut Butter in place of the peanut butter for an extra layer of wonderful. 8. Gluten-Free Peanut Butter Banana Pancakes
The sight of Allyson Kramer’s tower of peanut butter and banana pancakes is enough to get us to wake up early on a weekend and whip up this recipe. Substitute the creamy peanut butter with Justin’s Chocolate Hazelnut Butter for a brunch special that will make your gluten-free dreams come true. 9. Spicy Peanut Eggplant and Shallot Stew
Leave it to vegan cookbook author extraordinaire Isa Chandra Moskowitz to turn a pantry staple into a hearty bowl of eggplant, tomato, and peanut stew. Try using BeKind Butters’ Boulder Heat, a peanut butter spread with a kick of paprika, in place of the plain PB for a bit of added spice. While the simple, wonderful PB&J sandwich will always have a place in our hearts, we can’t wait to try all of these recipes and more. Let us know in the comments what are some of your favorite nut butter brands and nut-based recipes. "
SCIENTISTS: HALVE MEAT CONSUMPTION TO FIGHT GLOBAL WARMING,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/scientists-halve-meat-consumption-to-fight-global-warming,"APRIL 16, 2012","Keeping in line with recent studies that point to the harmful environmental impact of the meat industry, new research suggests that reducing the demand for meat may play a serious role in curbing the effects of global warming. According to scientists at the Woods Hole Research Center, the developed world needs to cut its meat consumption by 50 percent in order to stabilize emissions of nitrous oxide—the biggest man-made contributor to the hole in the ozone. Additionally, because nitrous oxide is a byproduct of the nitrogen found in manure and fertilizers, researchers say the meat industry needs to modify current agricultural systems to use nitrogen more efficiently. Nitrous oxide is the third most dangerous greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide and methane, both of which are also released in meat production. "

Though she is pleased that pork producers have pledged to end the cruel practice, Animals Australia Campaign Director Lyn White says that the ban’s proposed five-year deadline isn’t enough. “The two-thirds of pigs who remain subjected to the cruelty of sow stalls won’t be alive to receive the benefits in 2017. It is clearly within the ability of the pig industry to alleviate their suffering now,” White says. "
ACTIVISTS URGE KIM KARDASHIAN TO LOSE FUR,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/activists-urge-kim-kardashian-to-lose-fur,"APRIL 16, 2012","Animal-advocacy groups are targeting television star-entrepreneur Kim Kardashian for her support of the fur industry and her sister Khloe’s withdrawal of support for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Kardashian was “flour-bombed” by PETA members last month at the launch party for her perfume, resulting in her and her rumored boyfriend Kanye West speaking out on Today and in a song (respectively) about their right to wear fur and their distaste for the organization. In response, Last Chance for Animals rallied against the star outside her boutique, Dash, reprimanding the star for speaking out in support of the cruel industry. While her sister Khloe no longer officially supports PETA, her former anti-fur views may help influence Kim to change her perspective. "

PROGRESSIVE PARENTING WITH ACTRESS MAYIM BIALIK,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/progressive-parenting-with-actress-mayim-bialik,"APRIL 15, 2012","Although best known for her acting chops, Mayim Bialik has much more on her plate than just her hit TV show, The Big Bang Theory. Between her entertainment career, social-activism projects, neuroscience studies, and busy life as a vegan mother of two, Bialik has managed to impress us even further by penning a book about parenting. In Beyond the Sling, she shares her personal triumphs, philosophies, and strategies for developing fulfilling, low-stress mother-child relationships through attachment parenting, a set of principles designed to develop trust and compassion through an emphasis on nurturing and bonding. We caught up with this multitalented mom to get the scoop on how she manages to do it all with grace and a smile. There’s just one more thing we’d like from Bialik—a cookbook! VegNews: For those of us who aren’t familiar with attachment parenting, what is the fundamental philosophy?           
Mayim Bialik: I think the main thrust of it is that the natural way that children exist gives very strong indications of how they need to be treated. So the way that mammals give birth, and feed their young, and sleep with their children—these are all things that attachment parenting looks to. But attachment parenting is also reflected in gentle discipline, methods of caring for your children that are consistent with building up relationships, and a lot of green and holistic people embrace it as well, since there’s an emphasis on balancing your life. And many attachment-parenting people also choose to lead a less consumer-heavy lifestyle, but that’s not necessarily [the philosophy]—it’s just something that many of us tend to do. VN: How does your background in neuroscience influence your parenting attitudes?
MB: A lot of my neuroscience training informed the parts of the books that focus on hormones, of pregnancy, labor, breast-feeding, closeness to your baby, and things like that. But I think some of the larger issues are not specific to scientists per se. Because the book is very personal, my experience as a scientist and as a person of faith to me has become very tied to an environmental consciousness, which in our house, looks like veganism. But—and this is the complexity—it doesn’t look like that for everyone. I tried to explore some of the principles that might allow people to understand it better, that might open up a window for them to understand some of the decisions that vegans make. VN: Have you found the attachment-parenting community to be a place where you can share veganism?
MB: Yes! I can’t say that my husband and I were attachment-parenting people from the get go. But we’ve found a lot of openness for a lot of variety in this community. True liberalism is allowing for all variations in choice. And although our personal choice is veganism, we’ve found that the attachment parenting community is open about a lot of things. So we have a handful of vegan friends, and we also have people who weren’t vegan but who are now partaking. My friend Denise Herrick Borchert—she’s a photographer who has worked with VegNews—introduced me to veganism. And then our friend Nancy started experimenting with it. It’s spreading in our little circle in really neat ways. Now, Denise and I are doing a no white sugar, unprocessed diet together, actually. For her, I think it’s more of a lifestyle, but I’ve been doing it as more of a cleanse, I’m just really loving it. I’ve been I think about 90-percent raw for two weeks. It’s awesome. I literally haven’t eaten anything with more than three ingredients. It’s really been fun! VN: Would you say that you generally experience positive reception from non-vegan parents when you talk to them about vegan parenting?
MB: No (laughs), it’s kind of a mixed bag, you know? A lot of people don’t understand it, and feel judged even though I’m not judging and haven’t even opened my mouth aside from saying “I’m vegan.” Social stuff can be hard, but living in a part of the world where there are so many variations, we know kids who are gluten free, or have allergies—my little guy is allergic to soy and cashews. So I feel like being vegan is one more thing, but I feel very fortunate that especially in LA, if our boys go to someone’s house for a playdate, most parents know what vegan means, they know not to feed our kids certain things, and that it’s not funny to feed them things that aren’t vegan. The more information I have, the better informed a vegan I am to try to spread positive information. I recently started writing for kveller.com, and I decided that I wanted to write a piece about vegan pregnancy because I feel like it’s been getting a bad rap. VN: How do you explain the concept of veganism to your children, or how do you think that they view it?
MB: I think that they view it the same way they view that we have a kosher house: There are certain things we eat and there are certain things we don’t. Just as my three-year old doesn’t understand the concept of the Torah and its prohibitions, I don’t know that he would understand yet the complexities of environmental, ethical, and health reasons why we’re vegan. But for us it works to say, this is what works for our bodies. Dr. Gordon, our pediatrician—who is vegan—this is what he says builds our bodies and our brains best, and this is what works for our family. I don’t want to have children who are judgmental of other kids or adults, what they eat … Our older son is six, and I think we will start more kind of age-appropriate information about some of the choices we make VN: It seems like most children are actually born with that deep sense of compassion and sort of love for animals.
MB: It varies by family when you want to introduce that. For our boys it’s kind of funny, if there’s a play-set of food and there’s chicken. My older son will say, “Chicken? Who eats chicken?” I don’t know that he’s even had that chickens-walking-around-are-the-chickens-that-he-hears-about-people-eating moment—I don’t know if that’s happened for him, but suffice it to say that they have a really varied, rich, exciting diet. We eat out, we eat in. And yeah, at birthday parties their lives may look different from other kids’ but to them, we haven’t had a problem. VN: If the day came when one of your children wanted to try cheese or a burger, how would you handle their request?
MB: I think being a Jewish kosher person has kind of warmed us up for that. There are certain foods we just don’t eat. It’s the same way that we deal with discipline. If you give a no, you have to give two yes’s. So if it’s “no, you can’t have that cookie,” it’s “you can have this cookie,” or “you can have a carrot,” or “you can have an apple,” or “you can have a handful of almonds.” The concept of gentle discipline and starting healthy habits with breastfeeding, those are things that have really served me well in the choices we’ve made as vegans. VN: How do you balance the philosophies of attachment parenting, which are so nurturing and so focused on being close with your child, without “hovering”?
MB: There are plenty of hovering parents who practice attachment parenting, but to be quite honest with you, there are plenty of parents I know who don’t practice attachment parenting who are also hovering. I think that might occur statistically more often in attachment parenting, but it’s not really my style. I think that’s personality, I think it’s anxiety and a lot of other things. A lot of people are surprised when I say that I’m really not that big on handwashing, or “you have to sit here when you eat,” or “I’m going to watch you eat that and make sure you don’t choke,” or “don’t get dirty, and use antibacterial wash”… it’s not my style. I’m really for kids exploring, playing, being adventurous, and being however they naturally want to be. To me, it’s more about the personality of the parent, and I’ve found that that does shape the personality of the child more. But [people] want to hear that there’s an easy way to have the perfect kid and be the perfect parent. And unfortunately, you kind of have to dig deep into your own crap when you become a parent, and you find out a lot about what pushes your buttons. But it also helps you grow—it’s the birth of you as an adult. Chat with Mayim, Sayward Rebhal, and Jesse Miner about the joys of vegan parenting at our next Twitter Chat, coming April 18. "

Rather than prohibiting antibiotics entirely, which the agency says would be an incredibly time-consuming and expensive task, the FDA’s new policy is designed to promote collaboration between drug companies, veterinarians, and livestock producers. The policy covers the use of antibiotics as growth promoters, but not those used for disease prevention. As a result, some remain skeptical of the policy’s effectiveness, warning that meat producers may be able to bypass the guidelines by getting growth-inducing drugs re-prescribed for the supposed purpose of preventing disease.

PINK SLIME: WHY THE MEAT INDUSTRY IS FREAKING OUT,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/pink-slime-why-the-meat-industry-is-freaking-out,"APRIL 10, 2012","In case you’ve been hiding in a meat-free bubble over the past month, a perfect storm of mainstream media coverage, social media, and consumer outrage has exposed a particularly distasteful component in America’s ground beef supply. Pink slime began as the brainchild of Eldon Roth, the head of a company called Beef Products, Inc. Roth took one look at fatty waste trimmings being relegated to dog food and saw potential for more. After several years of experimentation followed by concerted arm twisting of federal regulators, Roth had the solution: a high-tech process of heating, centrifuging, and ammonia treatment, needed to deal with pesky bugs like E. coli and salmonella. The result is what industry euphemistically calls lean finely textured beef, what a former US Department of Agriculture whistleblower coined pink slime, and what I call cheap filler. The reason the meat industry was happy to incorporate this newfangled substance into its ground beef is simple: to save money by extending supply. It wasn’t for sustainability to use the whole animal, or as a safety measure, or to make beef leaner, to name a few altruistic excuses the meat lobby has been tossing around lately. Pink slime has a singular purpose: to increase profits. According to meatingplace.com, the economic fall-out over pink slime “is costing packers as much as $40 per head, pushing already negative margins to a loss of nearly $100 per head.” Translation: the meat industry is losing money. No wonder they are so freaked out by the consumer backlash. This also explains why Beef Products and its powerful allies have been cashing in its political chips in a desperate attempt to resuscitate the product. An impressive array of state governors and federal government officials has come to the defense of pink slime. Instead of taking the side of consumers who’d rather not eat the questionable filler (what happened to the free market?), Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad is calling for a congressional hearing into the “smear campaign” that led to the public outcry. Classic misdirect known as shooting the messenger. (I am sure Eldon Roth’s campaign donations to the governor—to the tune of $152,000 in 2010 alone—are just a coincidence.) On Tuesday, a press event in Iowa hosted by Branstad was met with opposition from family farmers. The meat industry and its political puppets are pulling out all the stops not only because of the economic threat of this particular outcry. What’s at stake in the long term is far, far greater. From video exposés of animal abuses, to major fast food chains bowing to public pressure on animal treatment, to increasing popularity of campaigns like Meatless Mondays, the awakening of the American consciousness to the grim realities of meat production, with a turn toward healthier and more sustainable alternatives, can only continue. Meanwhile, many questions remain regarding pink slime. I highly recommend reading the 2009 New York Times story by Michael Moss, which raises important safety questions that don’t appear to be resolved. For example, how did the ammoniating process win approval from the USDA in the first place, and why is the product still allowed in school lunches? Also, why did Beef Products, Inc. sue to stop the release of test results that the USDA relied on for evidence of safety? And why does the USDA continue to vehemently defend the product now? Of course, pink slime is just part of a bigger problem. What other ways is ground beef processed that the industry rather you not know about? Why is meat so susceptible to contamination that we have to clean it up with chemicals? What other additives are we eating that don’t have to be labeled? (Here’s a long and scary list from the USDA for starters.) Aren’t there saner alternatives to this system? These are just some of the questions we (especially the media) should all be asking. With our political system broken, people are directing their anger directly at those responsible for feeding us. The public outrage sparked by pink slime should force more transparency. If we let this moment pass, the meat industry will just go back to business as usual. But we can’t let that happen.

Foie gras, French for “fatty liver,” is produced by force-feeding ducks or geese until their livers become massively enlarged—a process APRL argues is inherently cruel. “By claiming the foie gras they sell is ‘humane’ as a publicity stunt, these defendants are deliberately misleading consumers into purchasing a cruel product,” says attorney Bryan Pease, APRL’s co-founder.

Beginning in the 1970s, chickens were selectively bred to gain weight at an extremely rapid rate in order to shorten their time before slaughter, but as British scientists have discovered, their fat-to-protein ratio also increased significantly.  Heritage chickens are raised more naturally (typically classified as organic and free-range) and take 140 days to mature compared to only 40 days for factory-farmed chickens.

VEGANISM IS FOR MOTHERS,https://vegnews.com/2012/4/veganism-is-for-mothers,"APRIL 8, 2012","Like so many others before me, I came into ethical eating accidentally, by way of self-interest. See, I wanted to do this cleanse. It’s a story I’m certain you’ve heard before, and I’m sure you know how it ends. “Girl dips toes into veg diet, and in doing so removes the obstacles that are triggering cognitive dissonance. Girl can see clearly for the first time how being an omnivore is truly at odds with her ideals, and realizes that violent eating does not a pacifist person make. Girl never looks back.” As I explored this bright new plant-based world, I excitedly set about on a path of self-education: I played in the kitchen, I re-thought my wardrobe, and I became a connoisseur of vegan media. Websites, podcasts, magazines, books, and anything else that I could get my eager mitts on, I gobbled it all up. In the process I learned about everything from nutritional yeast and Herbivore hoodies to The China Study, all the way to the great abolition vs. welfare debate. And of course, at the heart of it all, I learned about the horrors of animal agriculture. This incredible intake of information is a pretty standard aspect of transition, which makes sense when you consider the magnitude of ideological shift. I loved the learning, but eventually, the ever-present sadness of animal suffering began to wear on me. So I packed up the exposés and I focused on the upside. I was working my outreach, I was blogging, and I continued on my merry way of life. And a merry life it was! In the spring of 2010, in the golden hours of early dawn, my first little baby boy was born. If you’ve ever been around infants, you know that they come with a lot of down time. And it was during one of those quiet spells, with my nursling happily dozing in my arms that I stumbled upon an undercover video taken from inside a dairy operation. It had been such a long time since I’d watched anything like that, and maybe because I was sleep deprived and not thinking clearly, I figured that I was due for a refresher. I was witness to all manner of sickening reality unfolding over the next few minutes. The filth and the feces, the torture at the milk machines, the beatings and blood, and eventually, the slaughter line. But what I remember most is something that still haunts me: A beautiful heifer, a brand new mother still slick with sweat from her labor, was screaming as she paced and bucked and fought for the calf that two men were dragging away from her. I remember feeling the weight of her agony crashing over me. My chest clenched tight, and I looked down at my own sweet baby snuggled against me. And I wept for her. The intersection of animal exploitation and female oppression was first explored by Carol J. Adams more than 20 years ago, and has been well studied ever since. I knew of the theory, but to me, it had always been just that—another theory. Another piece of the animal-rights puzzle that fit nicely into my intellectual arsenal. Seeing that mother suffering turned an abstract theory into crystalline actuality—a primal connection at my core. As a mother. And I realized that these exploits of agriculture, this use and abuse of the reproductive cycle, is not just a crime against females. It is, in fact, the systematic sabotage of mothering. Some years ago I read that brooding hens, sitting atop their clutch, will lovingly cluck and coo to their eggs beneath them. And those little developing chicks, too delicate yet for this world, will chirp right back from safe inside their shells. I remember being pregnant myself, laying my hands on my swelling belly, and lovingly clucking and cooing my own sweet nothings to my son inside. I could feel him there, stirring when he heard me, kicking his delight at the sound of my whispers. Mothers all want health and happiness for our babes. That hope is universal; it’s written into the DNA that connects us, within and between species. And so as mothers we are responsible to one another. To stand with mothers—all mothers—in honoring that precious, primitive, magnificent act of mothering. Becoming a mother is in many ways akin to becoming vegan. It’s an unfamiliar path and there’s unexpected adjustments, there’s so much to read and so much to learn and everyone has their two cents to add. Most of all, there’s this exquisite blossom of love at the center of it. Veganism is founded on compassion, and compassion is the guiding light of motherhood. To me, they are just two shades of the same color, and I feel so grateful to have found the both of them.

Under the new city ordinance, Minneapolis residents will be allowed to keep chickens after obtaining a special permit, but only as companion animals—not for commercial or agricultural use. Furthermore, animals, including chickens, will no longer be allowed in community gardens or on urban farms, and animal slaughter will be prohibited. The measure is an effort on behalf of the city to curb the widespread neglect, abandonment, and abuse of local chickens, instances of which have been on the rise since 2001. "

Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University and Arizona State University have discovered that birds are also routinely fed illegal antibiotics, caffeine, and even chemical compounds found in common medications. Testing feather meal from factory-farm chickens, scientists found traces of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, which are banned in poultry production due to their potential to breed antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Furthermore, researchers found evidence of the active ingredients in Benadryl, Tylenol, and even Prozac, found in Chinese chicken meal—all of which may be used to reduce anxiety among chicken, as stress toughens the birds’ meat and inhibits their growth.

Known for its distinct musky odor, ambergris is used in high-end perfumes to make the scent last longer on skin and fabric. In addition to being expensive—merely one gram of ambergris can cost upwards of $20—the fact that it comes from an endangered whale species has led to concern over the compound’s impact on sperm-whale populations. As a result, scientists from the University of British Columbia are hoping its cruelty-free replacement, a lab-grown compound derived from balsam fir trees, offers a sustainable solution that would protect both whale populations and balsam firs from depletion.

Analyzing data retrieved at a Midwestern pork-producing plant from 2005 to 2006, researchers at the Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine found that pigs with discernible lesions were 90 percent more likely to carry Salmonella pathogens. Researchers say lesions and other signs of low-grade infection can go undetected by the federal inspectors who examine slaughterhouse-bound pigs. As a result, contaminated animals can spread harmful pathogens to the food supply. In light of their findings, the study’s authors are advocating for a lesion-evaluation system aimed at decreasing instances of food-borne illness. "

MAKE UP YOUR OWN HOLIDAY,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/make-up-your-own-holiday,"MARCH 27, 2012","Oh, little-known holidays, you bring us so much joy. In the illustrious tradition of such gems as Toothache Day (February 9), Toasted Marshmallow Day (August 30), and the almost-too-big-to-be-on-this-list Pi Day (March 14), less famous holidays offer a reason to celebrate something nearly every day of the year. But perhaps you find fault with the holiday-naming authorities. Perhaps you can’t stand to be told to hug a postman or eat an applesauce cake on their official days. If your rebellious nature demands that you go against the grain, have we got a holiday for you. Today, we celebrate those wayward pioneers who just can’t help but put their own spin on things. Today, we revel in creativity and gumption. Today, we celebrate Make Up Your Own Holiday Day. But how best to take advantage of today’s promise? Here’s a handy guide for making the most of the liberty of festivity.

DIY, Darling!
Of course, a holiday that’s totally yours should come from you! But if starting from scratch seems a bit over ambitious, we have you covered. First you’ll need a theme. Might we suggest finding a person (or group of people) who inspires you? With spring now officially here, maybe you’re ready to get back into shape after winter’s countless casseroles. Put those two ideas together, and you have National Vegan Athlete Day! Celebrate by putting up your biggest posters of Robert Cheeke, Rich Roll, Brendan Brazier, and Tonya Kay, doing a really intense workout, and then gathering for a friendly game of Ultimate Frisbee (the workout of choice of Farm Sanctuary Co-founder Gene Baur). Or, if you’re not-so-much a Tough Mudder as a trend monger, organize a clothing swap with your most fashion-focused of friends in honor of Cruelty-Free Couture Day. Get inspired by Vaute Couture’s recently opened flagship store, and use only reclaimed or recycled items to turn your living room into a model-ready runway. You definitely get bonus points if you happen to throw this eco-friendly soirée in April, the month that also boasts Earth Day (April 22). Whatever your impulse, go with it!

Subtle Suggestions
Since just about everybody loves a good party, making up your own holiday can be the perfect excuse to introduce friends and family to the wondrous ways of veganism. Enlist a few voracious volunteers, and set about creating as many vegan versions of your favorite food as possible, then invite over a gaggle of gobblers. Try establishing National Mashed Potato Day (aka, the best day of your life!), National Beet Burger Day, or National Cookie Spread Doughnut Day, and then go absolutely crazy with variations. Keep it subtle by not even mentioning that the dishes are vegan until they’ve been completely devoured, and then let guests know about the cruelty-free cuisine. Since the misconception that vegan food lacks flair and flavor still (somehow) persists, wowing your co-celebrants with a stunning smorgasbord can open people’s minds to the abundance of veganism.

Ask For It Day!
OK, there’s a pretty good chance that this day will make for some pretty bad puns, but go with us for a minute here. No vegan is an island, and for many of us, it can be difficult to watch those around us—especially our closest friends and family—eat animal products. Whether out of concern for the animals, the planet, or the health of our beloved humans (or all three!), sitting idly at a meat-laden table can be frustrating. So, take the opportunity of creating your own holiday to observe Ask For It Day by asking those around you to go vegan, just for a day. This idea lends itself particularly well to a yearly tradition, which you might start by focusing on one person in your life and treating them to a full day’s worth of awesome vegan grub. Each year, you could add to the party by asking more friends to participate, or chose a different honoree who gets your full attention that day.

No matter what tactic you take, creating more traditions that involve cruelty-free celebrations is an excellent way to spend your time—perhaps even more exciting than International Talk Like a Pirate Day (September 19). Perhaps. "

According to the report, approximately 24 horses die each week at racing facilities across the country, with the majority of these deaths going unexamined by veterinary personnel. The widespread practice of drugging horses seems to be at the root of this staggering statistic—in addition to illegal drugs given to the animals to enhance their on-track performance, legal painkillers are frequently used to mask injuries, causing pre-race veterinary examinations to be less effective and leaving injured horses vulnerable to breaking down during a race. Researchers found that as many as 90 percent of horses who break down had pre-existing injuries. "
JUDGE ORDERS FDA TO ENFORCE ANTIBIOTICS BAN ON ANIMAL FEED,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/judge-orders-fda-to-enforce-antibiotics-ban-on-animal-feed,"MARCH 26, 2012","On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Food and Drug Administration to make steps toward implementing a 35-year-old ban on antibiotics in livestock and poultry feed. In 1977, upon concluding that the routine use of antibiotics in animal feed weakened their effectiveness in humans, the FDA issued an order to ban the nonmedical use of penicillin and tetracycline in feed, unless drug companies could verify their safety. Though opposition from members of Congress and lobbyists caused the rule to remain inactive for more than 30 years, last week’s ruling will force the FDA to begin withdrawing its approval of the antibiotics’ use on farm animals. Drug companies will have a chance to defend the safety of their products at an upcoming public hearing, keeping in line with the conditions of the 1977 rule. "

Among this year’s winners were the 2011 summer blockbuster Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which was named the year’s Outstanding Feature Film for its depiction of the ethical issues surrounding animal testing, and the ABC series 20/20, which took home the TV Newsmagazine award for its compelling exposé of the cruel treatment of birds at an egg factory farm. In all, more than 20 awards were distributed to print, television, and film projects, as well as individuals. Photo: flickr.com "
WHY VEGNEWS LOVES ESQUIRE,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/why-vegnews-loves-esquire,"MARCH 26, 2012","The March+April issue of VegNews was a first for this magazine: We penned the inaugural Man Issue, a celebration of the many awesome vegan men who are promoting a plant-based diet in myriad amazing ways. And with this first came another: We framed our issue as our version of Esquire. In Managing Editor Elizabeth Castoria’s most popular Editor’s Note ever, Castoria tells the men’s magazine why we love it so much, and where it needs to reevaluate its views on what it means to be (and, more specifically, eat like) a man. Here’s what she said. Dear Esquire, Hello, tiger. Before we begin, I’m just going to come out and say it: I love you, man. From one magazine to another, you look good on paper. You bring me presents every month (you’re right, funny jokes are funnier when told by beautiful women), you look great in the morning, and you always know just what to say in a caption. Your fonts are downright flirty; your design makes me daydream about what our future will look like (who isn’t wondering about the forecast for print media these days?). From the rugged jawlines of your studly cover subjects to the whimsy with which you banter, you get so much right. Your features bring a whole new meaning to texting (and sometimes are damn-near sexting). To you, Esquire, I bat my editorial eyelashes. But there’s one thing, honey. It’s not much, just a small point of contention in our otherwise blissful union. I don’t think you know what a man is. Don’t get me wrong, there are men aplenty in your pages, many of whom even have the six-packs to prove it. You suffer no shortage of testosterone, but there’s something missing. The meaning of man is changing, and as our culture progresses, the definition will not exclusively include dudes who can stand attractively around a grill. The growing awareness and coverage of veganism in mainstream (or, shall I say, manstream) media makes one thing clear: Men are more than the sum of their suits these days. They are healthy, active, and, most importantly, compassionate. Manliness is moving away from the confines of locker rooms and tailgate parties, and expanding into a new era. So, like any good, supportive lady friend, I’m here to help. This issue, we feature this new breed of men—and lots of them. Call it an homme-age, if you will. These guys, some of whom have already been in your spotlight, are a roadmap to a better future for all of us. From former President Bill Clinton—you know, the guy from your February cover this year—whose dedication to saving his own life via a vegan diet is completely unimpeachable, to Dave Conrardy, a 430-pound trucker who found his healthy salvation—and a much smaller waistline—through raw foods, these guys are the future. Guy writer Joshua Katcher explores the transition away from the butt of protein-based jokes and toward places of power the world over that vegan men are experiencing (p.42). Longtime activist and VN contributor Mark Hawthorne examines the literal deep sh*t that our environment is in because of factory farming, and then shows us a clear way out of the mire. Businessman Ryan Howard, lawyer-turned-elite athlete Rich Roll, and personal chef Jesse Miner give us the inside intel on what being a great vegan dad really takes. Oh, and then there’s the matter of Tim VanOrden, who might be the toughest SOB we’ve ever encountered—the man can literally run up 75 flights of stairs in less than 10 minutes—and who just happens to eat a totally raw diet. Yes, he runs on lettuce. Intellectuals, activists, and everyday Joes are using plant-based diets to power through the stereotypes that cast vegetarians as anemic weaklings. To make sure that no pocket square is left unfolded, we’ve incorporated some truly mantastic eats in this issue, starting out with the cheesiest, most-loaded twice-baked potatoes you’ve ever tasted (p.70). I know you like potato chips and chocolate, so we put them together for you in a truly mind-blowing truffle (p.74). And in case you were wondering what dudes around the world are eating, check out our fantastic food feature, which not only has a phenomenal all-American chili, but offers filling, hearty meals from Morocco, Brazil, Italy, and Thailand. You know what everyone loves? A man who can cook. Hope this helps. If you need anything, you know where to find me. See you on the newsstand, handsome. The end, love E. "
SHOULD JUNK FOOD BE TAXED?,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/should-junk-food-be-taxed,"MARCH 25, 2012","The United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on food rights recently submitted a report that questions whether governments should tax junk foods as a means of protecting their citizens from preventable diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. Though the Human Rights Council typically deals more with issues surrounding food accessability, the report highlights the growing problems with the abundance of unhealthful junk foods, and suggests taxing items such as soda and foods that are rich in saturated fat, salt, and sugar. By calling attention to the issues of deregulated agribusiness systems, the report questions whether member governments have violated the rights of their citizens by allowing an abundance of junk food.

WENDY’S UPS WELFARE STANDARDS,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/wendys-ups-welfare-standards,"MARCH 25, 2012","Fast-food giant Wendy’s Co. announced Friday that it will be implementing new criteria for the care and slaughtering processes of the chickens and pigs sourced for its meat products. The chain’s animal-welfare council explained that one of the company’s largest chicken suppliers has discontinued the use of electric shocks to stun chickens, instead opting for a newer, more humane method that utilizes a low-atmosphere pressure system. Additionally, Wendy’s will be phasing out the use of gestation crates at its pork-producing facilities, following the lead of McDonald’s, which made the same pledge in February. With 6,500 locations worldwide, Wendy’s is the second largest burger chain in the country. "
OHIO VOTERS SHUN BATTERY CAGES,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/ohio-voters-shun-battery-cages,"MARCH 25, 2012","A recent poll of Ohio voters has found that the vast majority of the state’s citizens support a new federal bill that would enrich conditions for factory-farm hens and eradicate the use of battery cages. Conducted earlier this month by Saperstein Associates, the survey revealed that 71 percent of voters back HR 3798, a bill that would nearly double the size of egg-laying hens’ cages as well as require perches, nesting boxes, and other improved environmental attributes. The bill would also reduce the acceptable level of ammonia in chicken facilities, tighten regulations on slaughtering methods, and implement egg-carton labels that provide consumers with information about source-farm conditions. The Humane Society of the United States and United Egg Producers collaborated on the bill in efforts to tackle both the industry inconsistency of state-by-state laws and the welfare issues posed by existing factory-farm conditions.

Each year, participants from around the globe hold bake sales during the prescribed time period and donate the funds they raise to charities of their choice. Up to 150 individual bake sales usually take place during the week, and a grand total of $100,000 has been raised during the first three years of the event. The bake sale has garnered major media attention in years past from CNN, which applauded the simplicity and effectiveness of the program.    "
DAIRY DOESN’T PREVENT INJURY,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/dairy-doesnt-prevent-injury,"MARCH 22, 2012","Contrary to the prevailing belief that drinking milk is vital for young people’s bone health, a new study published in Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine suggests that dairy products and calcium are ineffective in preventing stress fractures—common sports-related injuries. Researchers from Children’s Hospital Boston and Harvard University followed a group of adolescent girls ages nine to 15 over a period of seven years, analyzing their calcium, dairy, and vitamin D intakes, along with the frequency they experienced stress fractures. Unexpectedly, girls with the highest intake of calcium—mostly derived from dairy products—were found to experience twice as many stress fractures as those who consumed less calcium. On the contrary, a high intake of vitamin D was shown to decrease the risk of the injury by at least 50 percent. "
GMO FOOD LABELS BACKED IN CT,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/gmo-food-labels-backed-in-ct,"MARCH 22, 2012","Concerns about the potential negative health effects of genetically modified foods have only grown in recent years, and Connecticut may be the first state taking legislative measures to ensure that its citizens are informed about GMO usage. On Wednesday, a bill designed to mandate labeling of GMO foods received overwhelming approval from the state’s Environment Committee, with 23 of 29 members supporting its passage. However, the bill requires a green light from several other state departments before going into effect, and is facing opposition from the Farm Bureau and Department of Agriculture, who argue that the issue should be handled by the federal government rather than on a local level. Nearly 20 states are currently in the process of deliberating over legislation that would implement similar labels. "
BRITS EMBRACE VEGGIES,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/brits-embrace-veggies,"MARCH 22, 2012","According to a survey commissioned by Alpro, a British company that specializes in plant-based dairy alternatives, more UK consumers are replacing the meat- and dairy-laden foods typical of a standard British diet with fruits and vegetables. The survey found that four out of 10 British consumers say they currently eat more plant-based foods than they did last year, and six out of 10 say they eat more plant-based foods than they did five years ago. Though this trend was visible across all age groups, it was particularly pronounced among people between the ages of 18 and 30, with more than half of young consumers revealing that they have increased their produce intake in the past year.

UTAH PASSES AG-GAG LAW,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/utah-passes-ag-gag-law,"MARCH 21, 2012","On Tuesday, Utah became the second state after Iowa to pass an ag-gag law aimed at protecting the agricultural industry from undercover investigations, which proponents of the law say are damaging to companies’ financial interests and credibility. Under the new law, people who document operations on a farm without permission could face a class A misdemeanor and up to a year of jail time. Mercy For Animals Executive Director Nathan Runkle is outraged at the decision, saying the law will create “a safe haven for animal abuse and other criminal activity in the state.” MFA and other animal-welfare organizations are currently exploring legal strategies to challenge the legislation.

GERVAIS’ ANTI-CRUELTY CAMPAIGN,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/gervais-anti-cruelty-campaign,"MARCH 21, 2012","Last week, British comedian Ricky Gervais announced that he will be representing and assisting the new activist organization Cruelty Free International in its goal of eliminating the use of animals in cosmetic testing. On March 15, Gervais tweeted that he could not condone the torture of animals for the sake of shampoo. Shortly thereafter, CFI released a new public service announcement featuring the funnyman, wherein he pets a rabbit and states, “We urgently need a worldwide ban on this cruel and unnecessary suffering … it’s time to close the door on animal testing for good.” According to the campaign’s website, more than 80 percent of the world still allows cosmetic testing on animals.

SAFEWAY WON’T SELL PINK SLIME,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/safeway-wont-sell-pink-slime,"MARCH 21, 2012","Safeway has become the latest company to announce its intentions to discontinue the supply of ammoniated beef, known colloquially as “pink slime.” Responding to what it calls “considerable consumer concern,” the supermarket chain says it will no longer purchase products containing the substance—cheap, low-quality scraps of beef trimmings treated with ammonia to kill bacteria—despite its insistence that the US Department of Agriculture-approved substance is safe. Ammoniated beef has been the subject of national controversy in recent months: fast-food chains such as McDonald’s, Taco Bell, and Burger King stopped using it in January. Safeway’s announcement comes less than a week after the USDA announced that schools enrolled in the national lunch program will soon be able to opt out of serving the substance. "
HSUS FILES SEABOARD COMPLAINT,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/hsus-files-seaboard-complaint,"MARCH 20, 2012","Roughly two months after revealing inhumane treatment of pigs at a facility of Seaboard Foods, the Humane Society of the United States has filed a formal complaint against the pork producer—the country’s third-largest—with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. HSUS alleges that Seaboard made false claims and declined to communicate adequately with the animal-welfare organization, which is a shareholder of the company. Last September, HSUS filed a proposal urging the pork producer to gradually discontinue the use of gestation crates for its sows and received a response claiming that the producer’s animal-care policies were “cruelty-free,” a statement which HSUS argues is deceptive.

BOB BARKER AGAINST AG-GAG,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/bob-barker-against-ag-gag,"MARCH 20, 2012","Former The Price is Right host Bob Barker is speaking out against a proposed Missouri bill that would require individuals to report documented instances of animal cruelty on farms within 24 hours, calling it a hurdle to undercover investigators looking to expose routine abuse. “Missouri lawmakers must realize that consumers are demanding better treatment of animals used for food, not for the agriculture industry to cover up illegal acts and penalize those who try to expose routine cruelty,” Barker writes in a letter to state legislators. As evidence of the importance of long-term investigations, the veteran television personality cites People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ three month-long undercover operation at a Iowa Hormel supplier in 2008, which resulted in six workers being charged with livestock neglect and abuse.

7 CAN’T-MISS FILMS OF 2012,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/7-cant-miss-films-of-2012,"MARCH 20, 2012","With awards shows and film festivals heavily dotting spring calendars, ‘tis the season to get a sneak peek at the year’s newest movies, from art-house to IMAX. This year offers a variety of documentaries and narratives that touch on issues pertinent to veganism, such as the sentience of animals, the complexity of our food system, and the power of a plant-based diet. Here are seven movies worth a second look—and maybe even the price of a bucket of popcorn. Beastiaire
This intriguing conceptual art film by Denis Côté fixates on the complex interplay between captive animals and observers, with a focus on visual confrontation via eye contact. Named for medieval illustrated volumes of exotic beasts, the film is both voyeuristic and cerebral, observing fragmented scenes of majestic lions confined within humbling cages, a rhino being washed by a zookeeper, and cows staring meditatively at the camera from their crowded bovine community. The film’s intent remains somewhat ambiguous, but in the words of The Hollywood Reporter, “Côté ostensibly remains outside the debate about whether commercial animal parks are educational facilities or inhumane prisons. But Bestiaire deftly forces us to consider our fascination with other creatures and the cost to them of being placed for our scrutiny in artificial environments.” Bullhead
Not for the faint of heart, this Oscar-nominated Belgian drama follows an aggressive, steroid-inflated cattle farmer as he makes a black-market deal with a Mafioso meat trader for illegal growth hormones, some of which he takes himself. Part-character study, part-crime film, Bullhead is more of a thriller than an anti-meat film, but it nonetheless shines a light on—and raises questions about—the bad business of beef. Cages of Shame
The recipient of the Humane Society of the United States ACE Documentary Film Grant, Cages of Shame is a powerful look into China’s cruel bear-bile farms and a tale of the rescue of 10 of their captives. Tragic but inspiring, the film follows animal activist Jill Robinson and her team as they do whatever it takes to liberate moon bears from a farm where they have lived devastatingly miserable lives in deplorable conditions, all in the name of collecting their bile for supposedly medicinal uses. Shedding light on a lesser-known but horrific industry, this documentary could have the power to raise awareness and abolish the practice of bear-bile farming forever. Chimpanzee
Three years in the making, Disney’s hyped nature documentary Chimpanzee arrives this spring—on Earth Day, to be exact. Following super-cute baby chimpanzee Oscar as he is orphaned in the African jungle and subsequently adopted by another female chimp who takes him under her figurative wing. In gorgeous high-definition and with an approach that is curious and empathetic, Chimpanzee is an exciting foray into an intimate primate society where few have tread before. Even better, Disneynature will make a 20-cent donation for each ticket sold opening week to the Jane Goodall Institute, which works to conserve chimpanzee and ape populations. Heal Your Self
In the vein of Forks Over Knives and Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead, Heal Your Self is an exploration of the impact of diet, stress, environmental toxins, and attitudes on personal health, attributing many elements of America’s health crisis on variables that are within our own control. Encouraging a take-charge attitude toward one’s own well-being, first-time filmmaker Norm Hacker consults a range of advocates from medical experts to cancer survivors to develop an all-encompassing outlook on how taking responsibility and adopting lifestyle changes can make all the difference in achieving optimum health and happiness. In Organic We Trust
This compelling documentary explores the ways that the American food system has been broken by big-ag, with smaller-scale, local farms—and human health—left with very real, very negative consequences. Pesticides, additives, and processed foods are killing us softly, but all hope is not lost, as the move toward sustainable farming, farmers’ markets, and community-supported agriculture is growing in strength and numbers. The film also explores the term “organic” and what it truly means in a system as complex as America’s. Powerful and smart, In Organic We Trust is here to explore the issues surrounding the ways that we grow, move, and buy our food. Minds In the Water
Vegan professional surfer David Rastovich is way more than just a beach bum—this dedicated activist traveled the world for five years to support the conservation of dolphins and whales, the very marine beasts with whom he shares the waves. This athlete’s love for creatures great and small takes him everywhere from Australia to Japan to California, all in the name of ending the habitat destruction and slaughter of the ocean’s gentle giants. Rastovich’s organization Surfers for Cetaceans aims to celebrate and protect the interspecies bond between humans, dolphins, and whales, and Minds In the Water offers an in-depth glimpse of the depth and importance of this relationship.

GM CROPS HARMING BUTTERFLIES,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/gm-crops-harming-butterflies,"MARCH 20, 2012","A new study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota and Iowa State University links Monsanto’s genetically modified crops to a drastic decline in monarch butterfly populations. According to the study’s authors, the number of monarch eggs in the Midwest declined by approximately 81 percent between 1999 and 2010, a period during which genetically modified crops became standard in the agricultural industry. Researchers say the rise of herbicide-resistant corn and soybean crops has enabled farmers to eradicate weeds easily—including milkweed, which serves as the host plant for monarch eggs and caterpillars. In light of these findings, some conservationists are proposing an increase in cultivating monarch habitats in pastures, gardens, and other areas outside agricultural fields. "
MARKET FOR FAKE MEAT BOOMING,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/market-for-fake-meat-booming,"MARCH 19, 2012","The meat-substitute industry is reportedly booming—and mainstream media sources are taking note. According to an NPR article published this week, 110 new faux-meat products have been introduced since 2010, with frozen items earning $267 million in sales last year. NPR says the mounting mainstream appeal of plant-based meat products is partially due to innovations in taste and texture—an observation echoed by The New York Times food columnist Mark Bittman, who recently described how increasingly palatable fake-meat products are becoming a viable solution to the adverse effects of the meat industry. He asks, “Would I rather eat cruelly raised, polluting, unhealthful chicken, or a plant product that’s nutritionally similar or superior, good enough to fool me, and requires no antibiotics, cutting off of heads, or other nasty things?” "
FIRST STARBUCKS JUICE BAR OPENS,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/first-starbucks-juice-bar-opens,"MARCH 19, 2012","Roughly four months after announcing that it had acquired juice company Evolution Fresh, Starbucks has opened the first location of its new juice-bar chain in Bellevue, WA. The coffee kingpin purchased the beverage business for $30 million this fall with the intent of increasing its presence in the growing health-food market, although the number of juice storefronts that Starbucks plans to operate remains unclear. Evolution Fresh offers an extensive menu of fresh-pressed fruit and vegetable juices alongside other healthful options and veg fare such as oatmeal, wraps, soups, and salads, with an emphasis on “superfoods” such as coconut water, kale, and quinoa. The Bellevue franchise will be observed by company officials as a preemptive example of the potential success of the new chain. "

The East Village eatery, established in 1996 by owner Kate Halpern, is renowned for its vegan buffalo wings—the only non-meat items to make it onto New York Magazine’s list of the city’s five best chicken wings. Halpern hopes to raise $30,000 by March 29, all of which will go toward paying back rent. If her fundraising goal is met, Halpern plans to launch several new ventures aimed at increasing business, including turning part of the restaurant into a vegan and gluten-free bakery. "
PLANT-BASED DIET AND MS RELIEF,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/plant-based-diet-and-ms-relief,"MARCH 18, 2012","According to a new study led by Australian medical expert and author George Jelinek, a plant-based diet may contribute to relieving symptoms of multiple sclerosis. In a 10-year study, Jelinek and his team found that a combination of a plant-based diet, exercise, exposure to sunlight, and stress-reduction techniques improved multiple-sclerosis patients’ quality of life by up to 20 percent. For the next stage of research, the team will attempt to determine which of these lifestyle factors—or combination thereof—ultimately makes the biggest difference. Jelinek views his findings as a potential breakthrough in MS research. “It’s remarkable to us that we had such a significant improvement for people when the usual course should be progressive deterioration,” he says.

PETA UNCOVERS ABUSE ON FARM,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/peta-uncovers-abuse-on-farm,"MARCH 18, 2012","On Friday, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released a video depicting what it says amounts to abusive practices and deplorable conditions on Adirondack Farms in New York, which supplies dairy to cheese companies such as Cabot and McCadam. The footage, captured during an undercover investigation in late 2011 and early 2012, allegedly shows farm workers engaging in abusive behavior—hitting cows with poles and sharp objects and dragging one cow approximately 25 feet using a skid steer. The organization says it has contacted the owners of the farm, urging them to discipline the accused employees and implement stronger animal-welfare policies at its facilities. "
FUR LABELING ACT ENACTED,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/fur-labeling-act-enacted,"MARCH 18, 2012","This Sunday marks the enactment of the Truth in Fur Labeling Act of 2010, which mandates that clothing retailers identify fur and fur-trimmed garments truthfully or face serious legal repercussions. The act was signed into law last year, but offered a one-year enforcement grace period to allow businesses to change their policies. The Humane Society of the United States has released a statement urging retailers to abide by the new legislation, after filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission last year upon finding that many major department stores and online clothing outlets were mislabeling garments that contained animal pelts as “faux fur.” "
ANIMAL LAW: RESTRICTIONS AND REWARDS,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/animal-law-restrictions-and-rewards,"MARCH 18, 2012","As lawmakers across the country contemplate ag-gag legislation aimed at hindering undercover investigations on factory farms, and evidence of cruel farming practices continues to gain widespread media attention, farm-animal welfare issues are ever visible in today’s social and political landscape. While animal law as a legal discipline was virtually nonexistent until the 1970s, this emerging discipline, spanning environmental, social-justice, and food-safety issues, has become an increasingly accepted mode of legal scholarship. Many top schools now have law-review journals dedicated to animal-welfare law issues, positioning it on the cutting edge of the legal field. However, in spite of the fact that animal-welfare activism is gaining mainstream footing, bringing animal-cruelty issues to court, particularly in regards to factory farming, remains as difficult as ever. The complexities of the judicial and legislative systems have forced animal lawyers to pursue creative means of bringing about change, using tactical legal legwork to complement the respective strengths of animal-welfare politicians, lobbyists, and grassroots activists. Legislative Limitations
Unlike the majority of animals, farm animals aren’t protected under the federal Animal Welfare Act, which leaves them especially vulnerable to legally sanctioned abuse and exploitation. Weak federal laws such as the 28 Hour Law, which requires animals being transported to slaughter to be released from confinement every 28 hours, as well as the Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter Act, are under-enforced in practice. The latter, a federal effort to relieve animals of the pain of slaughter by stunning them, doesn’t apply to birds, which make up more than 90 percent of farmed animals. Some states, including California and New Jersey, have passed legislation regulating the treatment of farm animals, but most continue to follow statutes called Common Farming Exemptions, which authorize abusive practices, such as unanaesthetized pig castration and debeaking, if they are considered industry standards. Judicial Hurdles
In addition to the absence of federal and state laws protecting farm animals, animal-welfare lawyers looking to litigate factory-farm issues face another obstacle: because only district attorneys can prosecute violations of animal-cruelty laws, many animal lawyers lack the judicial standing to bring important cruelty cases to court. Animal attorneys such as those at the Animal Legal Defense Fund often try to work with district attorneys, offering their assistance and expertise. Still, according to Matthew Liebman, a staff attorney at ALDF, not all prosecutors are receptive to his organization’s attempts at litigating factory-farming cases. “In a predominately agricultural community where industry holds a lot of social and political power, it can be tough to convince the district attorney to go after a factory farm. And that’s especially the case when it’s pervasive industry practices,” says Liebman. Still, he says increasing media exposure and social pressure can be effective tactics when persuading district attorneys to take legal action. “There’s no question that prosecutors are sensitive to what the community is concerned about … to the extent that they know someone is watching, I think that they look at the case a little more closely.” Legal Strategizing
Faced with these hurdles, Liebman and his fellow ALDF attorneys are required to be resourceful, turning to state food-safety and consumer-protection codes as a means of litigating on behalf of farm animals. In response to a 2010 undercover investigation into the Cal-Maine egg-production facility in Texas, which exposed horrific living conditions for the facility’s chickens, ALDF filed a lawsuit against the Texas public health commissioner, the Texas commissioner of agriculture, and the Texas animal-health commission. Because it couldn’t sue Cal-Maine for animal cruelty directly, ALDF sued the aforementioned public agents by arguing that the adverse living conditions at the farm constituted a threat to food safety and consumer welfare. Similarly, after a recent Compassion Over Killing investigation revealed the systematic abuse and mistreatment of baby chicks at the Cal-Cruz Hatcheries in Northern California, ALDF and COK filed a lawsuit against the egg-production company, framing the legal issue as one of consumer protection rather than animal cruelty. ALDF argued that, by disregarding the chicks’ welfare, Cal-Cruz was undermining the integrity of the industry and cutting corners—practices ALDF says are in direct violation of the California Business and Professions Code. Media coverage of the lawsuit resulted in supermarket chain Whole Foods Market cutting ties with the chick farm, though the case has yet to be settled. Looking Ahead
With ag-gag legislation pending in several states, ALDF is preparing to use this kind of strategic litigating to discourage lawmakers from passing what the organization believes are restrictive and dangerous laws that could prevent consumers from receiving valuable information about the safety of their food. Its new website, protectyourfood.com, outlines its solution to the ag-gag phenomenon—an oppositional proposal called the Protect Your Food Act (also known as The Safeguarding the Public from Food-Borne Illnesses Act) that, if adopted, would prohibit state governments from acquiring food products from jurisdictions that have implemented ag-gag legislation. Liebman says the Protect Your Food campaign is ALDF’s attempt to go on the offensive. “[The campaign is] supposed to be a disincentive for industry to try to convince states to pass these laws, because it’ll ultimately hurt them financially,” he says. Working Together
Legislative victories in the realm of farm-animal welfare, though not brought about through litigation, are vital to the field of animal law. State ballot measures such as California’s Proposition 2, a 2008 statute that outlawed the use of gestation crates and battery cages on all farms, and the state’s ban on foie gras, effective this year, not only improve the treatment of farm animals as a whole, but also provide ample opportunity for litigation. According to Liebman, members of the agricultural industry often try to challenge these measures, enabling organizations such as ALDF to intervene in defense of the law. Liebman says animal-welfare legislation done on a Congressional level or by popular vote complements the legal work done by him and his colleagues, forming two fundamental pieces of the animal-welfare movement. “When we sue, we’re suing to enforce laws, and if those laws aren’t there to begin with—if there hasn’t been public pressure or political pressure, social movements or activism, to get those laws in place—then we have nothing to sue about,” he says. “Without changing that backdrop, without changing what the social norms are around how we treat and think about our relationships with animals, we’re not going to make a lot of progress.” Public policymakers, lawyers, and activists each play a crucial role in the movement, relying on each group’s particular strengths to bring about concrete change. “Law does accomplish things that other modes of activism and social change can’t. It doesn’t mean it’s more important, it just means it’s part of a broader whole,” he says. “Legislation only works if you can get the majority behind you. Activism is dependent on changing people’s minds. The good thing about litigation is that it’s backed by the power of the court and, to the extent that you can force industry to make changes or be held in contempt of court, I think that’s powerful.” "
ELLEN AND SIMPSON TALK VEGANISM,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/ellen-and-simpson-talk-veganism,"MARCH 17, 2012","Vegan television personality Ellen DeGeneres used her daytime talk show to expound on her love of faux-meat company Gardein in an episode that aired Tuesday. When her guest, singer and fashion designer Jessica Simpson, amiably teased DeGeneres about how her vegan diet restricts her from eating Tex Mex-style ground beef—which Simpson called “the good stuff”—DeGeneres used the opportunity to educate the singer about the wonders of fake meat. “They actually make really good stuff that tastes just like beef called Gardein and it tastes exactly like it,” DeGeneres says, promising to send the skeptical star some samples. DeGeneres first featured Gardein’s plant-based products in a December 2009 broadcast of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, calling it “the greatest product that came along.” "
ANCIENT VEGAN MAMMALS FOUND,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/ancient-vegan-mammals-found,"MARCH 16, 2012","Researchers have debunked the prevalent theory that mammals were not pervasive during the time of the dinosaurs after uncovering a previously unrecognized group of rodent-like creatures dubbed multituberculates. These unique mammals coexisted with dinosaurs for roughly 20 million years, able to do so because they fed off of plant-based food sources that were not in high demand from other species. Multituberculates were named for their teeth, which had special bumps and cusps for crushing plant fibers. Although they continued to thrive after the extinction of dinosaurs, they were eventually eradicated by growing populations of primates, hoofed animals, and rodents. "
SCHOOLS CAN DROP PINK SLIME,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/schools-can-drop-pink-slime,"MARCH 15, 2012","In response to public outcry surrounding the use of ammoniated beef—also known as “pink slime”—in public school lunches, the US Department of Agriculture announced yesterday that, come fall, schools enrolled in the national lunch program will be able to choose between serving leaner beef containing the substance and fattier beef made without it. The announcement comes after The Daily reported that the USDA purchased 7 million pounds of the chemically treated beef trimmings for use in school lunches. Though it insists that all products served in its lunch program surpass stringent federal safety standards, the USDA says the decision was made in order to respect the demands of its customers. "
TRANS FAT LINKED TO AGGRESSION,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/trans-fat-linked-to-aggression,"MARCH 15, 2012","According to a new study conducted by researchers from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, there may be a link between the consumption of trans fats—typically found in meat and dairy products such as ground beef, ice cream, and margarine—and aggressive behavior. Examining the diets and behavioral history of 945 adults, researchers found that people’s propensity for aggressiveness and irritability correlated directly to their trans-fat intake—a fact that remained true even after eliminating variables such as age, sex, and ethnicity as possible factors. The study’s findings suggest that, in addition to being physically harmful, consuming trans fats may have psychological and social ramifications as well. "

Last month, animal-welfare activists were outraged after discovering that two horses were injured and consequently euthanized on set, an incident that prompted People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to launch an investigation into the safety guidelines used during filming. Following this most recent incident, PETA Vice President Kathy Guillermo says, “We will want answers on HBO’s latest casualty … Three horses have now died and all the evidence we have gathered points to sloppy oversight, the use of unfit, injured horses, and disregard for the treatment of thoroughbreds.” "

RED MEAT LINKED TO DEATH,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/red-meat-linked-to-death,"MARCH 13, 2012","A new study published this week confirms what scientists have been saying for years: eating red meat—particularly processed meat—is associated with an increased risk of premature death. Surveying the diets and health of more than 121,000 adults over a 28-year period, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found that each daily serving of red meat increased participants’ risk of premature death by 13 percent, as compared to subjects who ate healthier proteins, such as grains and nuts. Even more staggering, individuals who consumed an extra serving of processed red meat, such as bacon or hot dogs, were 20 percent more likely to face premature death. Researchers point to high levels of saturated fat and iron, the presence of toxic preservatives, and carcinogens released during the cooking process as possible causes. "

A new study conducted at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and published in the journal PloS ONE tracked the fruit and vegetable consumption of 35 participants over the course of six weeks and documented changes in their skin color. Researchers found that those who ate more fruits and vegetables displayed healthier, more appealing red and yellow tones in their skin. According to test organizers, an increase of approximately three daily servings of produce maintained over six weeks will produce an ideal shift in skin tone for “apparent health and attractiveness” improvement.

GERMAN MEAT SUBSTITUTE PRODUCT,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/german-meat-substitute-product,"MARCH 12, 2012","While plant-based beef, chicken, and turkey substitutes abound in grocery stores worldwide, some argue that companies have not totally succeeded at replicating the texture and flavor of real meat. But researchers at Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute aim to create a new vegetarian meat product that will unequivocally win over omnivores. The project’s factory currently produces between 130 and 150 pounds per hour of the faux meat, which is derived from plant proteins that have been treated to form juicy fibers similar to those of real meat. Later this month, the researchers will be showcasing their product at the Anuga Foodtec trade fair, and they hope to have it on the market by next year. "
BOXER OPTS FOR VEGAN DIET,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/boxer-opts-for-vegan-diet,"MARCH 12, 2012","Boxer Timothy Bradley is gearing up for his upcoming World Boxing Organization fight with a training regimen he says gives him a distinct edge over his competitor: a strict vegan diet. In the months leading up to his June welterweight championship fight against Manny Pacquiao, Bradley has given up animal products—a move he swears improves not only his physical performance in the ring, but his mental clarity as well. The boxing champ first went vegan before a fight in 2008 at the suggestion of an advisor and has continued the tradition ever since. “It’s the most unbelievable feeling ever … The reason I love it so much is that I feel connected to the world,” he says.

Even for those of us who are relatively culinarily incompetent, pasta is fast, it’s easy, and it provides a belly full of Italian comfort. Vegan marinara is a no-brainer, but cream-based sauces have been trickier to devise sans dairy. We love Victoria Vegan’s Vegan Vodka Sauce, which has a smoothier, creamier texture than its typical tomato-paste counterparts, and harnesses the flavor power of imported Italian tomatoes, fresh garlic and basil, and, of course, our old friend vodka. We’re ready to douse our rigatoni, ravioli, or rotini with this super sauce, which is also gluten- and GMO-free. Mamma mia! "

An updated version of the guidelines, some of which are almost 10 years old, is due for release later this year, pending government review. In light of the upcoming revisions, the organizations are asking government officials to consider replacing the title of the guideline’s fourth food group, currently designated as “lean meat and poultry, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds and legumes/beans,” with the more general title “protein.” The groups say, “We strongly believe that the guidelines, in their current format, are woefully inadequate as they do not consider the way a food is sourced or its method of production.” "

Following the Senate’s revisions, the bill is going to Governor Gary Herbert for consideration. Should it pass, Utah will become the second state to approve a bill protecting the interests of agricultural companies. The Iowa Senate passed a similar bill on March 1. "

STUDY: GOING VEG BOOSTS MOOD,https://vegnews.com/2012/3/study-going-veg-boosts-mood,"MARCH 4, 2012","New research published in the health periodical Nutrition Journal suggests that vegetarians may enjoy sunnier moods than their omnivorous counterparts. The study examined 39 omnivores, who were assigned either a meat-heavy, fish-moderate, or completely vegetarian diet, and surveyed after two weeks. Researchers found that omnivores reported experiencing more negative moods—such as anxiety, stress, and depression—than vegetarians, possibly due to meat’s higher content of arachidonic acid, a component found to create brain changes that impact disposition. Overall, mood scores for vegetarians saw notable improvement after the trial period. The study concludes that “restricting meat, fish, and poultry improved some domains of short-term mood state in modern omnivores.” "

The measure, which passed the Senate in a 40-10 vote, is a revised version of House File 589, a bill that would have criminalized the act of filming or recording operations on a farm without the owner’s consent. Rather than barring individuals from obtaining footage covertly, the new legislation prohibits people from accessing the farm’s facilities under false pretenses. Under the new law, an activist who lies on a job application with the intention of documenting internal operations will face charges of “agricultural production facility fraud.” Mercy For Animals Executive Director Nathan Runkle has spoken out against the bill, calling it “patently un-American, dangerous, and a broad government overreach.” "
DAIRY FARM CHARGED FOR POLLUTION,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/dairy-farm-charged-for-pollution,"FEBRUARY 29, 2012","A federal district court judge recently ruled that Nelson Faria Dairy—a factory farm, or Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation, in Royal City, WA—be held accountable for violations of the Clean Water Act. The decision marks the first incident that a CAFO has been held responsible for pollution and ordered to monitor nearby water and soil for future damage. In this case, the farm’s insufficient system for managing its massive output of untreated manure contaminated local groundwater, soil, and drainage, threatening public safety and resulting in a lawsuit from nonprofit Community Association for the Restoration of the Environment. CARE president Helen Reddout tells website Ecocentric, “It is now time for the agencies who are supposed to be protecting our health to follow the precedent set by this order.” "
INTERNATIONAL ANIMAL ABUSE,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/international-animal-abuse,"FEBRUARY 29, 2012","Investigators from animal-welfare organization Animals Australia have uncovered video revealing what the organization says amounts to 46 potential breaches of the country’s new government regulations on the treatment of exported cattle. The hour-long footage reveals workers at an Indonesian slaughterhouse engaging in cruel practices, allegedly cutting up Australian cattle before they are dead and restraining the animals in metal boxes. Australia’s Federal Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig has pledged to work with Animals Australia to investigate the footage and take action accordingly. “If this industry does want a bright future it has to put animal welfare at the heart of the system. What we now have is a system that allows that to happen,” he says. "
VEGAN PARENTING ON ABC,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/vegan-parenting-on-abc,"FEBRUARY 28, 2012","On Monday, broadcast news outlet ABC 7 Chicago aired a special segment on raising vegan children, demonstrating that many young vegans thrive on a plant-based diet. According to the segment, veganism has become a hot-button issue in the media, with many blogs and editorials cautioning against the potentially harmful—and even fatal—consequences of vegan parenting. Chicago-based pediatric dietitian Lara Field acknowledges that an improperly planned vegan diet can lead to vitamin deficiencies, but debunks the notion that vegan parenting is inherently unsafe, saying, “I think there’s a lot of alarmists out there about everything, and I think with proper balance it can work out … In a natural sense, a vegan diet is a wonderful choice.” "
VEGANS TAKING NON-VEG MEDS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/vegans-taking-non-veg-meds,"FEBRUARY 28, 2012","A new study in the Postgraduate Medical Journal reveals that a quarter of vegan or vegetarian medical patients use prescription drugs containing animal-derived ingredients, contrary to their dietary restrictions. After surveying urology patients, British researchers found that, of the 200 patients who avoid animal ingredients, 49 were unknowingly taking medicine containing gelatin. In response to their findings, the study’s authors call for a clearer labeling system in the pharmaceutical industry. Though drug companies are required by EU law to disclose all ingredients in the medications they manufacture, Liz O’Neill, a spokesperson for The Vegetarian Society of the UK, says the current labels are unclear. “Some vegetarians will be shocked to learn about the widespread use of animal ingredients in medicines,” she says. "
VEGAN DOUGHNUTS NYC’S BEST,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/vegan-doughnuts-nycs-best,"FEBRUARY 28, 2012","The NY Daily News has crowned the best doughnuts in New York City, and Brooklyn’s all-vegan Dun-Well Doughnuts tops the list. Dun-Well opened just last year after successfully raising $15,000 through project-funding website Indiegogo, allowing founders Christopher Hollowell and Dan Dunbar to open a storefront in Williamsburg. The Daily News cites the shop’s fresh, organic, locally sourced ingredients and unbeatable family recipe as the key components to its winning pastries, which come in flavors such as lavender-lemon, peanut butter-and-jelly, peach cobbler, and Earl Grey tea. The doughnut shop has also made headlines for offering a tongue-in-cheek “faux gras” doughnut, filled with a lentil-based alternative to the cruel delicacy, in response to the controversial meaty version created by a fellow Brooklyn restaurant. "
CREATIVE WAYS TO MEET PEOPLE,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/creative-ways-to-meet-people,"FEBRUARY 28, 2012","PETA President Ingrid Newkirk famously suggested that all vegans should date omnivores, thereby seducing them not only to our boudoirs, but also to our cruelty-free lifestyle. Maybe you’re looking for that special someone (either for conversion, or just for conversation), maybe you’ve recently moved to a new town, or maybe you’re simply sick of seeing the faces of your five standard friends each night. Whatever your reason for wanting to expand your social circle, navigating the waters of new friendships (or, gulp, romantic relationships) can be daunting. How do hip and modern singles fill up their digital dance cards? Whether online or in person, here are a few of our favorite ways to meet new people.

App-ropo
For everything from getting a reservation at your favorite restaurant to sucking away hours of precious time with mindless games, apps do everything these days—including helping connect with new potential friends. Foursquare is the best-known location-based app of the bunch, as it blends gaming with social networking. Users check in at real-life locations (say, your favorite happy-hour bar), and are rewarded for the frequency with which they visit that location. Users can see where their friends are, and if someone interesting happens to be nearby. Loopt offers a similar experience, minus the gaming. Loopt users can crowd source insider info about specific locations (for example, asking other users for secret menu items at a favorite vegetarian restaurant), and post location-based activities for new people to join. Finally, for a very direct approach, there’s Grindr and Blendr. Users of these two apps upload profiles, and get notifications when other users are in their vicinity. The premise of both apps is to find someone nearby for a quick meet up—so be prepared for some forwardness.

Sites for Sore Eyes
If the phrase “online dating” sends shivers down your spine, take a deep breath. A host of newish sites have cropped up that aim to take the awkward out of online dating. Nerve, a news site all about sex, love, and relationships, offers Nerve Dating, which allows users to ask questions, post about their favorite activities, and saves them the embarrassment of writing a long, personal introduction. The idea behind Nerve Dating is that people strike up conversations as they might at a real life party, not in a forced, awkward way. OkCupid quizzes its users on how they date, revealing the mysteries of the heart to the online community. The site also allows those looking for love to narrow their search by keywords (such as the obvious “vegan”). Finally, Missed Connections is where the hope of love springs eternal. Users post descriptions of people they’ve seen on the street, but never gotten the chance to speak with. Saw a cute gal at the grocery store who also happened to be restocking her Food for Lovers queso supply? Post about it, and see if she loves you back! Though less informative than the dating sites that list more aspects of someone’s personality, the possibility of finding that one person whose eyes you met across a crowded produce bin is pretty epic.

The Old Fashioned Way
There’s no two ways about it: sometimes, you just have to go up to someone cute and introduce yourself. Vegan Drinks happen nationwide, and can be great for finding like-minded loves. If you’re feeling particularly brave, just find an activity that interests you, and chat up the cutie who also happens to be there. Mortified offers ice-breakers galore, as willing participants read journals from high school, in all their embarrassing glory. Whether you go old-school or new-fangled in your quest for human companionship, there are myriad methods for meeting strangers, aka friends you don’t know yet.    "
UTAH FACES AG-GAG BILL,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/utah-faces-ag-gag-bill,"FEBRUARY 27, 2012","This week, a bill is moving to the Senate that would make covert filming on farms, dairies, and ranches a misdemeanor in the state of Utah. The bill, which passed the House in a 60-14 vote last week, is designed to protect agricultural businesses from “national propaganda groups” threatening to shut down operations, says its sponsor, House Rep. John Mathis. Animal-welfare organizations have been staunch opponents of the proposed law since its inception, viewing it as a hurdle in the fight against animal abuse on factory farms. Suzanne McMillan, director of farm-animal welfare at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, tells the Associated Press, “Americans deserve to know how their food is produced, and responsible farmers should welcome that transparency.” "
NONDAIRY MILK SALES RISE,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/nondairy-milk-sales-rise,"FEBRUARY 27, 2012","Consumer-marketing organization Packaged Facts has released a new study revealing that nondairy milk sales are rising rapidly in the US, while dairy milk consumption is on the decline. Sales of plant-based milks reached an estimated $1.33 billion in the US in 2011, while per-capita consumption of cows’ milk slumped from 24.3 gallons in 1994 to 20.8 gallons in 2008. While soymilk remains the most popular nondairy alternative, almond milk, rice milk, and coconut milk are all growing markets as well. The report corresponds with a Wall Street Journal article from last year that focused on the rising popularity of almond milk and the defensive strategies of the dairy industry, which has recently launched “Got milk?” advertisements aiming to discredit the validity of plant-based alternatives. "
UNDERWOOD TALKS VEGANISM,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/underwood-talks-veganism,"FEBRUARY 27, 2012","In a recent article in Nashville’s Nfocus Magazine, country singer Carrie Underwood discusses her diet and wellness routines, crediting her lean physique to healthy, homemade vegan meals and a steady workout regimen. The American Idol winner, who went vegan last year for health reasons, dishes on her favorite plant-based snacks, including raw fruit and nuts, vegetables and hummus, and the occasional bite of dark chocolate. She admits that she is a diligent label-reader who prefers eating in, saying, “It’s hard for me to find quick food to eat, so I always make my own food ahead of time and take it with me. That way, I know exactly what’s in it and I can still stay healthy and satisfied when I’m working.” "
EURO PIG FARM CRUELTY EXPOSED,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/euro-pig-farm-cruelty-exposed,"FEBRUARY 26, 2012","This month, European animal-protection group Animal Equality released two disturbing videos exposing extreme abuse at pig farms in England and Spain. The first investigation spanned two months at the supposedly “ethical” Harling Farm in Norfolk, England, and revealed workers throwing piglets and bashing in their heads on concrete, workers hitting pigs with rods and knives, and dying animals denied veterinary care. A simultaneous investigation conducted at El Escobar Farm in Spain revealed similar—and in some cases, worse—treatment of pigs, with workers cutting into fully conscious pigs’ organs and stabbing pigs with swords. The Spanish investigation has spawned a petition—which has gathered more than 16,000 signatures thus far—admonishing the farm, and the British exposé earned front page coverage on the UK’s Sunday Times. "
RESCUE GROUPS SAVE HENS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/rescue-groups-save-hens,"FEBRUARY 26, 2012","Animal-rescue groups are flocking to a Northern California egg-laying farm to take in thousands of hens allegedly abandoned by the farm’s owner after he could no longer afford to feed them. Investigating a complaint about a foul smell, authorities arrived to the abandoned A&L Poultry farm to find approximately 50,000 neglected hens—an estimated one-third of which had died—that appeared to have gone without feed for weeks. Rescue groups Animal Place, Farm Sanctuary, and Harvest Home Animal Sanctuary have each stepped up to save the roughly 2,000 healthy surviving hens from euthanasia. “We’re going to give them another chance at life,” says Kimberly Surla of Animal Place. The ranch’s owner, Andrew Keung Chung, will likely face criminal animal-cruelty charges. "
NY LOOKING TO BAN SHARK FINS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/ny-looking-to-ban-shark-fins,"FEBRUARY 26, 2012","If a new bill introduced in the New York State Assembly passes, New York will become the fifth state to ban the sale, possession, and distribution of shark fins, which are primarily used for shark fin soup, a traditional Chinese delicacy. Despite their lack of flavor, shark fins have become a valuable commodity in many Chinese-American communities due to their association with wealth and opulence. However, proponents of the ban point to the shark fin industry’s destructive and cruel nature—approximately 73 million sharks are killed for their fins each year, with some species nearing extinction. “This is going to be a huge adjustment for the community, but it’s important to be responsible citizens,” says Assemblywoman Grace Meng, who is co-sponsoring the bill. "
"IT’S ALL UP TO YOU (YEAH, YOU!)",https://vegnews.com/2012/2/its-all-up-to-you-yeah-you,"FEBRUARY 26, 2012","It’s impossible to ignore: Animal rights has started to go viral. Throughout the past few years, we have traveled across the US and Canada giving talks on veganism, activism, and animal law, while being lucky enough to eat delectable vegan grub—in cities like Kansas City, Dallas, and Orlando. We have seen, firsthand, the fundamental reality that things really are starting to shift. How has this happened? For one thing, obviously, there are the powerhouse organizations. By the time you finish reading this article, Mercy For Animals will probably have come out with another undercover investigation, and Farm Sanctuary will have rescued another flock, herd, or gaggle. Animal organizations and sanctuaries are growing exponentially, and doing powerful work. However, those groups, wonderful as they are, are not the whole ball game. Each of us is part of the team, and we all need to step up to the plate at some point. Unquestionably, that’s exactly what is happening. Everywhere we’ve traveled, we’ve been gobsmacked to learn of the work of individual activists—whether they’re office workers, teachers, lawyers, students, nurses, or fill-in-the-blank—all with their own unique spin on changing the world for animals. Nothing could make us happier. Providing ideas and opportunities for people who have awakened to the nightmare that is happening to animals—and want to do something to change it—is at the core of Our Hen House. This trend is vibrant, yet it’s just beginning. The fate of animals and the animal-protection movement could still go either way—and which way it goes is up to each of us. Advocacy With Heart
Jewelry designer Bonnie Goodman, of Missoula, MT, is someone who knows that all too well, and is doing her part to keep the momentum going. As one example, her community-wide, totally vegan “Spay-Ghetti and No-Balls” dinners raise money for spay and neuter services, while, at the same time, raising awareness about the plight of farmed animals. “Everyone who attends is a self-proclaimed animal-lover,” she says, so her goal “is to show people that vegan is easy, yummy, and not scary.” For Goodman, the response has been mind-blowing. “Do you remember the first time you tasted ‘vegan food’ and realized ‘this tastes good, I can do this!?’” she says. “We see that reaction at every event.” In Madison, WI, nurse practitioner Courtney Mayhew has made it her goal to spread veganism to the doctors, nurses, and medical professionals with whom she works. Mayhew started a “vegan challenge” where people can sign up to follow a vegan diet for a day, week, or month. She offers unwavering support, including a daily email with recipes, tips, and FAQs, and even a grocery excursion. “I don’t ever want to turn anyone off from veganism by being judgmental or all-knowing,” says Mayhew. “Every little thing each individual does adds up for the animals, and I love being a part of that change.” Mayhew and Goodman are outstanding ambassadors for the cause, but they are not alone. In cities, suburbs, and countrysides, our travels have allowed us to meet people who are changing the world in profound ways—beginning with their communities. One person started a vegan support group in an Overeaters Anonymous chapter, making sure to use the group not only to support vegans, but also to embrace the veg-curious, fostering their compassionate inclinations. Another got the large environmental organization she works for to adopt a policy to make all of their events meat-free. Yet another volunteered to start an adult class at his local community center, calling it “Animal Rights 101.” These people aren’t just signing a petition and calling it a day. They are looking around and finding opportunities right where they live and work to spread the vegan message, and to educate their friends, colleagues, family, and neighbors to think of all animals as thinking, feeling individuals deserving of dignity and happiness. Time for You to Change the World, Too
Though the world is indeed beginning to wake up to animal issues, sometimes convincing people who have deeply ingrained habits and corporate-fed misinformation on their side can feel like an uphill slog. During those frustrating, sometimes infuriating moments, it’s important not to forget that we have the most powerful weapon of all on our side—the truth. Times, they are-a changin’, and every single one of us can help make them change faster. Like Goodman, Mayhew, and so many others, we each have the innate power to look into our hearts and ask, what can I do in my lifetime to create change for animals? Jasmin Singer and Mariann Sullivan are the co-founders of Our Hen House—named the “Indie Media Powerhouse” in VegNews’ 2011 Veggie Awards. Our Hen House is a multimedia hive of opportunities to change the world for animals (don’t miss the weekly podcast).   Photo courtesy of Jo-Anne McArthur "
NYC VEGETARIAN FOOD FESTIVAL,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/nyc-vegetarian-food-festival,"FEBRUARY 25, 2012","The second-annual NYC Vegetarian Food Festival returns to the Big Apple March 3rd and 4­th, offering two days of entertainment and meat-free food vendors. The event’s 25-plus speakers include clinical nutritionist and blogger Gena Hamshaw, award-winning marathoner Brendan Brazier, cookbook author Terry Hope Romero, and vegan life coach Ellen Jaffe Jones. Attendees will also be treated to cooking demos and samples from vendors such as Daiya, Coconut Bliss, Yves Veggie Cuisine, Chicago Soydairy, and more. The festival will take place at Manhattan’s Metropolitan Pavilion, and is sponsored by a host of animal-welfare organizations and food companies including Whole Foods Market, Mercy For Animals, Rescue Chocolate, One Green Planet, Yelp, and Yummy Plants.

RICE-BASED FOODS CONTAIN ARSENIC,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/rice-based-foods-contain-arsenic,"FEBRUARY 24, 2012","Researchers from Dartmouth College have published a new study revealing alarmingly high levels of arsenic in rice-based foods, including organic toddler formula and cereal bars. The government regulates arsenic in drinking water, imposing a federal limit of 10 parts per billion, but has yet to establish a limit for arsenic in food. While many foods commonly show trace amounts of arsenic, rice plants are particularly susceptible to “taking up” the naturally occurring compound. As a result, researchers say some rice products—especially those containing concentrated rice ingredients such as brown rice syrup—contain arsenic levels as high as 128 parts per billion. Dartmouth researchers recommend that people with diets rich in rice diversify their grains, since the safety threshold hasn’t been defined. "
SHRIMPS’ HUGE CARBON FOOTPRINT,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/shrimps-huge-carbon-footprint,"FEBRUARY 23, 2012","According to a new study, the mangrove deforestation required for shrimp farming results in a massive land-use carbon footprint, with a one-pound bag of store-bought frozen shrimp producing one ton of carbon dioxide. Oregon State University biologist J. Boone Kauffman, who conducted the research, says many shrimp farming ponds are located in Asia on cleared mangrove forests. Inefficient use of this land causes a substantial carbon footprint—it takes five square miles of deforested land to produce only 2.2 pounds of shrimp. According to Kauffman, the environmental impact of those 2.2 pounds is approximately 10 times greater than that of an equivalent amount of beef produced on a cleared rainforest pasture—without taking into account emissions from farm development, processing, and shipping. "
SCIENTISTS: WHALES DESERVE RIGHTS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/scientists-whales-deserve-rights,"FEBRUARY 23, 2012","A group of scientists is advocating for a Declaration of Rights for Cetaceans, which would recognize dolphins and whales as “non-human persons,” thereby endowing them with the same legal rights to life and freedom as humans. The proposal, discussed at last week’s annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, cites advances in cetacean research as proof of the mammals’ advanced cognitive abilities—abilities so sophisticated that experts say harming or killing them is as ethically unsound as harming or killing human beings. Ethics professor Tom White from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, an advocate of the declaration, says, “The science has shown that individuality—consciousness, self-awareness—is no longer a unique human property. That poses all kinds of challenges.” "
VEGAN BARBECUE KICKSTARTER,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/vegan-barbecue-kickstarter,"FEBRUARY 23, 2012","Portland-based food cart Homegrown Smoker is looking to open a second cart with the help of donations collected from Kickstarter. The cart, which specializes in gourmet vegan barbecue, has seen growing success since opening in April of 2009, and seeks $5,000 by March 15 to assist in handling costs of kitchen appliances—such as stoves, grills, sinks, and a hood system—for an additional location. Homegrown Smoker has been winning over Portlanders with menu items such as apple-smoked “pastrami” sandwiches on grilled rye, gluten-free cornbread, and mac-n-cheese relleno burritos. The operators have already been offered more than $3,000 from 65 donors, but 20 days still remain for the Kickstarter project. "
ANTIBIOTIC USE CAUSES SUPERBUGS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/antibiotic-use-causes-superbugs,"FEBRUARY 22, 2012","New research has confirmed what many have long argued—prevalent antibiotic use in livestock is leading to an increase in drug-resistant infections. A study published in the American Society for Microbiology journal mBio demonstrates that Staphylococcus aureus infections—known colloquially as “staph”—can jump back and forth between humans and livestock, developing resistance to antibiotics when transmitted to pigs and then reinfecting humans. Researchers from the Translational Genomics Research Institute performed genome analysis on a staph strain in 19 different countries in order to reach the disturbing conclusion, with the drug-resistant strain detected in almost half of all meat in the US consumer system. The study refutes the claim that rampant use of antibiotics in livestock feed will not negatively impact human populations, which livestock groups have argued for decades. "
BISHOPS GO VEG FOR LENT,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/bishops-go-veg-for-lent,"FEBRUARY 22, 2012","Several Anglican Bishops from the UK are encouraging their constituents to give up meat for Lent, calling meat consumption a “spiritual issue.” The Bishops of Oxford, Monmouth, Chelmsford, and the former Bishop of Dover—all meat eaters—have vowed to adopt a compassionate, meat-free diet until Easter Sunday, which marks the end of the 40-day religious fast. Their decision, prompted in part by encouragement from the Anglican Society for the Welfare of Animals, is also grounded in moral, environmental, and health reasons. The Bishop of Chelmsford says, “What I find intolerable and unsupportable is the way we rob factory-farmed animals of anything resembling a normal life, in order to furnish ourselves with … cheap meat.” "
WHALE MEAT SALE CONTROVERSY,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/whale-meat-sale-controversy,"FEBRUARY 22, 2012","This week, online retailer amazon.com was under fire from animal-welfare advocates after the Environmental Investigation Agency and Humane Society International found 147 products containing whale meat—which was banned as part of an international moratorium on whale slaughter in 1982—on the site’s Japanese subsidiary. An EIA report summarizing the matter revealed that many of the products were derived from endangered whale species protected under the moratorium, sparking protests from animal-welfare and conservation groups. Additionally, the EIA found that many of the products contained potentially hazardous levels of mercury far exceeding Japanese limits. In response to massive public outcry, Amazon has since removed the products from its site. "
FORKS OVER KNIVES DOCUMENTARY MAKERS TALK SEX,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/forks-over-knives-documentary-makers-talk-sex,"FEBRUARY 22, 2012","Last year’s much-hyped documentary Forks Over Knives made waves and inspired many to go vegan with its compelling argument for the benefits of a plant-based diet. Then last month, the makers of the hit film released a new video focusing on how veganism can boost one’s sexual health and performance. Intrigued, we caught up with Brian Wendel, the film’s creator and executive producer, for an inside look at why ditching meat and dairy is so hot—in more ways than one—as well as the team’s new Farms 2 Forks program. VegNews: What inspired the Forks Over Knives team to make a video focusing on veganism and sexual health?
Brian Wendel: We thought a short video that had some humorous elements would be a good way to provide an educational piece that was a little more in-depth than what we covered in the film. We had some good footage that we shot for the film that we hadn’t used, and this seemed like a great way to implement it with an interesting message. VN: For those who haven’t yet seen the video, can you summarize the ways that going vegan can improve one’s sex life?
BW: Sexual dysfunction is an indicator of the same problems that lead to cardiovascular disease, and the same plant foods that promote the free-flow of blood to the heart also promote the free flow of blood “downstairs,” if you will. VN: Any advice on certain foods that can enhance “performance”?
BW: It’s not so much the specific foods that matter as much as the overall diet. If one’s diet is based in low-fat, whole-plant foods, this is a winning formula. VN: What is the new program Farms 2 Forks, and what does it offer attendees?
BW: Farms 2 Forks is a new collaboration with [Rip Esselstyn’s] The Engine 2 Diet, comprised of weekend retreats where we will teach attendees the ins-and-outs of a whole-food, plant-based diet through hands-on activities. People will be able to go home feeling confident about the diet, and know how to make it delicious and effective for reaching good health and optimum weight. VN: Does the FOK team have any plans to create more short films or another full-length feature film?
BW: We recently released The Engine 2 Kitchen Rescue, wherein Rip Esselstyn goes into two different families’ homes, cleans out their pantries, and provides some basic lessons on making healthy, plant-based meals. We are looking at some other opportunities for a new video right now, but nothing concrete. In the meantime, we are finally launching our new website by April 1, and releasing a new book in June. VN:  How does it feel to see so many big names (Ozzy Osbourne, Jason Mraz, Russell Brand, etc.) citing FOK as a major influence in going vegan? 
BW: The fact that the film has helped so many people go vegan, whether big name or not, has been the most gratifying experience of my professional career. It’s amazing when celebrities announce their support of the film, because they in turn help us reach so many people that may not otherwise hear about it. For information about entering a Farms 2 Forks immersion program in a city near you, visit their website for testimonials, speakers, a schedule of events, and more, or check out Forks Over Knives on DVD or Netflix now.

IN-VITRO BEEF BREAKTHROUGH,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/in-vitro-beef-breakthrough,"FEBRUARY 21, 2012","A team of scientists in the Netherlands is one step closer to bringing in-vitro beef products to the masses, with a prototype of the world’s first artificially created hamburger patty expected to debut this October. The lab-produced patty, which replicates the taste and texture of real beef, is grown using cows’ stem cells—a process which doesn’t necessarily require animals to be slaughtered. Though the initial product will only be available to a select group of individuals at approximately $350,000 a portion, the scientists predict that mass-produced in-vitro meat could be a reality in the next 10 years, offering a sustainable solution for the harmful environmental impact of the meat industry, as well as for the increasing global demand for meat products.

The major food-service company pledged to discontinue sourcing from farms that use battery cages, gestation crates, or veal crates, and to eliminate the use of foie gras altogether. In an interview with The Washington Post, Co-founder and CEO Fedele Bauccio states, “I really believe that everything stems from factory farms. Everything from the issues of safe food to public health to the dead zones in the ocean to what seeps into the waterways. It’s disgusting.” The company also pledges on its website to serve food that bears in mind the needs of vegan and vegetarian diners. "
5 TIPS FOR THROWING A WINNING OSCARS PARTY,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/5-tips-for-throwing-a-winning-oscars-party,"FEBRUARY 21, 2012","Even after 84 years, the illustrious Academy Awards are as compelling as ever. Watching the gussied-up glitterati vying to get their hands on that slim, golden statuette provides as many thrills as that tense moment of anticipation before the envelopes are unsealed, not to mention the fashion feats and flops and the inevitable missteps that come with live television. Whatever your reasons for watching, the Oscars provide an excellent excuse to gather around the television with good company—and ideally some Hollywood-caliber cocktails. So roll out your red carpet, stock up on Kleenex, and follow these tips for a memorable Oscars-watching experience. Do Your Homework
What fun is it to sit through a lengthy celebration of the film industry if you’re unfamiliar with the major players? Prep for the big night by giving yourself a crash-course in all things Oscars. Many of this year’s nominated movies are out on DVD, including Best Picture candidates The Help, Midnight in Paris, Moneyball, and The Tree of Life, so bust out your biggest bucket of popcorn and cozy up on the couch for a massive movie marathon—all in the name of research, of course. Come awards night you’ll be as in-the-know as host Billy Crystal himself! Eat Up
Conveniently timed right around dinner, use the lengthy ceremony as an excuse to gather your friends and family for some glorious grub. Snack on crowd-pleasing finger foods, such as Crispy Wedge Fries, Gluten-Free Stuffed Celery Bites, and White Bean Bruschetta, during the show’s less thrilling categories—after all, nothing spices up the acceptance speech for Best Sound Editing like savory veggie hors d’oeuvres. Once you and your guests have worked up an appetite, get into the Oscars spirit by whipping up some festive dishes inspired by the leading nominees. Gush about George Clooney’s performance in The Descendants over Hawaiian Pineapple Tofu, munch on Melty Cheese Fondue while remembering Midnight in Paris, and warm your belly with smoky Vegan Sausage Stew worthy of The Help’s Southern setting. Call the (Eco) Fashion Police
Channel your inner Joan Rivers and critique the stars’ sartorial selections by tuning in to live red carpet coverage, airing on multiple networks before the ceremony. Keep an eye out for Livia Firth, wife of actor Colin Firth, who launched her third-annual Green Carpet Challenge last month at the Golden Globes in an effort to encourage sustainable fashion at high-profile events. In addition to sporting her own eco-friendly duds, Firth has paired 10 iconic designers with celebrity Green Carpet ambassadors, each of whom will wear one-of-a-kind designs to awards ceremonies throughout the year. Earlier this month, Oscar-nominee and Green Carpet Challenge participant Viola Davis wore a salmon-colored Valentino dress made from recycled soda bottles to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards, so expect more innovative fashions at Sunday’s event. Cheer on the Vegans!
This year’s Oscars roster features a noteworthy vegan presence, with longtime vegan and film-industry darling Jessica Chastain nabbing a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role in last summer’s The Help. Though The Help didn’t make it into the Best Visual Effects category, the film did feature a bit of vegan movie magic: the platter of fried chicken Chastain’s character Celia Foote devours actually contains Tofurky-wrapped tofu dogs, battered and fried. Other veg connections this year include Best Picture hopefuls The Artist, which stars proud ethical vegan James Cromwell in a supporting role, and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, based on the book penned by vegan Eating Animals author Jonathan Safran Foer.

VOICELESS PREMIERES TV ADS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/voiceless-premieres-tv-ads,"FEBRUARY 21, 2012","This week, Australian animal-welfare nonprofit Voiceless premiered two commercials about the inhumane treatment of animals on factory farms, to be screened on Free to Air satellite TV channels. The ad campaigns, which feature the tagline “The truth is hard to swallow,” are designed to encourage Australian consumers to think about the origins of their food, depicting pregnant sows confined to cramped, dirty gestation crates and chickens sickened as a result of adverse living conditions. Voiceless produced the videos in collaboration with actors Hugo Weaving and Abbie Cornish, both of whom appear in the campaign, and Academy Award-winning producer Emile Sherman. "
2012’S 10 MUST-BUY VEGAN COOKBOOKS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/2012s-10-must-buy-vegan-cookbooks,"FEBRUARY 21, 2012","Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Sage Butter. Three Cheeze Pesto Pizza. Vanilla Pound Cake with Lemon-Lime Glaze. Are your tongues wagging? Your culinary (heck, just regular) hearts racing? These three delectable dishes are just a few of the hundreds found in this year’s newest vegan cookbooks. From your ultimate guide to vegan grilling to going raw (well, almost), the upcoming books on our must-read (and by “read” we mean “cook and devour”) list cover everything under the vegan cooking sun. The world might be ending in a few months, but at least we’ll have Falafel Sliders with Avocado Hummus before it all goes down. 1. Chloe’s Kitchen: 125 Easy, Delicious Recipes for Making the Food You Love the Vegan Way by Chloe Coscarelli (Simon & Schuster, March)
Did you know that Chloe Coscarelli was the first vegan to win Food Network’s Cupcake Wars? But of course! This wonderful, talented (and adorable!) chef can make more than just a mean cupcake. The pages of Chloe’s Kitchen are filled with appetizers (Artichoke-Walnut Pesto Crostini), entrées (Herbed Polenta Cutlets with Marsala Mushroom Ragout), and sandwiches (Mango Masala Panini) that will have you preheating your oven in no time (though there are cupcakes too—Ginger Nutmeg Spice Cupcakes, to be exact). 2. Practically Raw: Flexible Raw Recipes Anyone Can Make by Amber Shea Crawley (Vegan Heritage Press, March)
Whether you’re looking to incorporate more raw meals into your culinary repertoire or a raw foodist looking to warm things up a bit, Practically Raw is the book for you. Crawley’s recipes are flexible-raw, meaning that a cooked option is available for many of the uncooked dishes. And we must say, we’ll gladly be the ones who decide if the raw or cooked version of Primavera Pesto Pizza is tastier. 3. The Sexy Vegan Cookbook: Extraordinary Food from an Ordinary Dude by Brian L. Patton (The New World Library, March)
Anyone who starts out a cookbook with a quote from Mr. Spock is already a winner in our (cook)book. The Sexy Vegan isn’t short on anything: humor, sass, creativity, or delicious food. We’re particularly excited about Patton’s breakfast chapter aptly titled “The Second Most Important Meal of the Day, After Cocktails.” Humor and the Mostest Ultimate-est Breakfast Sandwich in the History of the Universe? We’re in love. 4. Ani’s 15-Day Fat Blast: The Kick-Ass Raw Food Plan to Get Lighter, Tighter, and Sexier … Super Fast by Ani Phyo (Da Capo Press, May)
We’re already huge fans of Ani Phyo’s raw-food cookbooks, so it’s only natural that we’re stoked for her newest uncooked cookbook. Fat Blast answers your questions and concerns about a raw diet, and, if you’re looking to slim down, offers an easy, all-raw plan that will help you lose up to 15 pounds in 15 days. Losing weight while enjoying sushi and dessert? That sure beats the Master Cleanse. 5. Grilling Vegan Style: 125 Fired-Up Recipes to Turn Every Bite into a Backyard BBQ by John Schlimm (Da Capo Press, May)
We first fell in love with John Schlimm when we read his boozy cookbook, The Tipsy Vegan, in 2011. Less than a year later, Schlimm is back with Grilling, named by Publishers Weekly as one of the top 10 cookbooks for Spring 2012. And with flame-ready recipes like Grilled Corn on the Cob with Lime & Pepper Sauce and Two-Faced Avocado Sandwiches, we can see why. But don’t worry—Schlimm still keeps you refreshed with an entire chapter on happy-hour offerings. July Martini with Strawberries and Honeydew, anyone? 6. Great Gluten-Free Vegan Eats: Cut Out the Gluten and Enjoy an Even Healthier Vegan Diet with Recipes for Fabulous, Allergy-Free Fare by Allyson Kramer (Fair Winds Press, June)
Allyson Kramer knows her food. Author of the popular blog Manifest Vegan, Kramer is penning her first cookbook with Eats. Considering the fact that the recipes (and photography!) on Manifest Vegan are beyond stellar, we’re pretty darn sure her first published work is going to be a success. And with Walnut Ravioli with Vodka Sauce and Chocolate Hazelnut Brownie Cheesecake, how could it not be? 7. Vegan à la Mode: More Than 100 Ice Creams, Gelatos, Granitas, and Other Frozen Delights by Hannah Kaminsky (Skyhorse Publishing, June)
Basically, the only thing you need to know about Vegan à la Mode is that it’s all ice cream, all the time. VN Columnist and master of vegan sweets Hannah Kaminsky is on her third saccharine tome, and if à la Mode is anything like Vegan Desserts and My Sweet Vegan, you’re going to actually want all ice cream (more specifically, Pink Pomegranate Marble Gelato and Coconut Chai Ice Cream), all the time (more specifically, 24-7). 8. Artisan Vegan Cheese by Miyoko Schinner (Book Publishing Co., August)
Forget tofu feta: Artisan Vegan Cheese is going to blow the lid off of everything you’ve ever heard about vegan cheese (or tasted, for that matter). Schinner, a longtime dairy-free master, uses the culturing process to create her cheeses as opposed to lemon juice or vinegar. In addition, only whole foods are used to make everything from the soft Meltable Monterey Jack to Pub Cheddar with Chives. And that’s not all: While the first half of the book is cheese central, the second half is filled with recipes that use the cheeses, from Butternut Squash and Gruyère Ravioli to Chocolate-Chestnut Cannoli. 9. Cookin’ Crunk: Eatin’ Vegan in the Dirty South by Bianca Phillips (Book Publishing Co., August)
A native of the mid-South and a current Memphian, Bianca Phillips has spent most of her life making Southern and soul food veggie-friendly. Needless to say, Cookin’ Crunk will be both authentic and belly-filling delicious. We can’t wait to stir up recipes for Country Fried Tempeh Steak with “Milk” Gravy, Fried Tofu Chicken Wafflewich with Maple-Dijon Sauce, and Holy Molé Chocolate-Chili Cupcakes with Cinnamon Buttercream. 10. Vegan Eats World by Terry Hope Romero (Da Capo Press, November)
We’re not sure, but we can only imagine how difficult it must be to improve upon such cookbooks as Veganomicon and Vegan Pie in the Sky. However, we think the co-author of the aforementioned books, one Terry Hope Romero, could do it with Vegan Eats World. VN’s Hot Urban Eats columnists travels the world in her newest tome, and leaves readers with recipes such as Grilled Leek Crepes with Romesco Sauce and Mochi Red Bean Ice Cream Dumplings. "
CARNIVORES DEVALUE ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/carnivores-devalue-animals,"FEBRUARY 19, 2012","A new paper published in the February 2012 issue of Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin suggests that meat-eaters downplay the mental abilities of the animals they eat. Participants in the study answered a series of questions that required them to rate animals’ mental abilities, including their emotional capacities and ability to plan. Researchers found a significant correlation between viewing certain animals as food and considering them to be mentally and emotionally inferior. Participants were also much less willing to eat animals that they deemed more mentally advanced. Science writer Art Markman explains in Psychology Today that the study illustrates the moral dilemma inherent in eating meat—one that is contemplated by meat-eaters on either a conscious or unconscious level.

STUDENT DESIGNS CHICKEN “MATRIX”,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/student-designs-chicken-matrix,"FEBRUARY 19, 2012","Lobotomized chickens plugged into a factory-farm system straight out of The Matrix could become a reality if André Ford, an architecture student at the Royal College of Art in London, has anything to say about it. Ford is making waves in the media by proposing that chicken farms become vertical factories that treat “‘animals’ bred for consumption” as “crops and agricultural products like any other,” removing chickens’ cerebral cortexes to deprive them of sensory perceptions and packing 1,000 birds onto each “leaf” of a vertical system by using tubes to provide them with food, water, and air and remove waste. While Ford describes his project as “pragmatic, not cynical,” it has been highly controversial and even proposed to be an ironic statement about the trajectory of animal welfare. "
CHICKEN LINKED TO UTIS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/chicken-linked-to-utis,"FEBRUARY 19, 2012","A new study appearing in an upcoming issue of the Center for Disease Control’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal suggests that contaminated chicken may be a primary source of urinary tract infections. Researchers at McGill University in Canada found that bacteria from chicken closely resemble human urinary tract infection bacteria—typically a strain of E. Coli—unlike bacteria from beef and pork, which is less likely to be genetically related. In order to curb the risk of urinary tract infections and other foodborne illnesses, the scientists recommend that chicken farms implement stricter anti-contamination policies, particularly considering the rise of drug-resistant infections.

In a letter to owner John Basso, the organization advised the restaurant to “declare moral bankruptcy” and stop glorifying obesity and cardiovascular disease with its morbid theme—the restaurant’s waitresses wear nurse uniforms and the restaurant’s slogan is “Taste Worth Dying For.” “Bypass surgery is no joke to anyone who has lost a loved one to heart disease,” says PCRM President Neal Barnard. “This latest emergency should be a wake-up call for the Heart Attack Grill.” "

The Vohzaydas are Portland-based animal-welfare and environmental activists who hope to bring vegan street food to the masses via tandem bike—thus the project’s moniker. The pair hopes to collect $2,000 by March 7 to purchase special tires, a trailer, and licenses for the cart, which will serve items such as buffalo tofu-ranch pizza, sushi wraps, hot dogs, nachos, kombucha, and more. In addition to being fueled by pedal power, the cart will have a minimal environmental impact by exclusively using organic, locally sourced ingredients. "

Police raided the North Carolina factory farm on December 28, after MFA showed authorities undercover footage of workers kicking, dragging, and bashing the heads of turkeys. In addition to the arrests, Sarah Jean Mason, director of Animal Health Programs with the state’s Department of Agriculture, pled guilty to obstruction of justice after warning a Butterball employee about December’s police raid. Butterball says the actions at their North Carolina facility violate its “zero tolerance policy for any mistreatment of our birds,” and has pledged to reevaluate its animal-welfare policies. "
PROCESSED MEAT AND DIABETES,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/processed-meat-and-diabetes,"FEBRUARY 16, 2012","A new study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition links processed meats to higher risk of diabetes in Native Americans. The study, which surveyed the diets and health of more than 2,000 Native Americans, determined that the subjects were more likely to develop diabetes within five years if their diets were rich in processed meat, especially Spam. According to the study, 50 percent of Native Americans develop diabetes by the age of 55, a phenomenon the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine attributes to the population’s limited access to healthy foods, and its dependence on the meat-centric US Department of Agriculture commodity program.

STUDY MEASURES FOOD EMISSIONS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/study-measures-food-emissions,"FEBRUARY 15, 2012","According to a new study conducted by researchers at Lancaster University and reported in the journal Energy Policy, the British meat and dairy industries release as much greenhouse gas as half the cars in the UK. The study measured greenhouse emissions associated with 61 different foods and determined that fresh meat and cheese have the largest carbon footprints—approximately 37 and 33 pounds of carbon dioxide per pound of food produced, respectively. Researches speculate that if all UK citizens switch to a vegetarian or vegan diet, it could reduce the total greenhouse gases emitted during UK food production by up to 26 percent, potentially saving 40 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.

NJ CANCELS HORSE DIVING,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/nj-cancels-horse-diving,"FEBRUARY 15, 2012","Atlantic City, NJ’s Steel Pier is canceling the revival of its historical horse-diving show in response to pressure from animal-welfare activists. The controversial event, a popular summer attraction at the pier from the 1920s to the 1970s, was set to return Memorial Day weekend and sparked outrage from animal-rights activists, who circulated a petition decrying the animals’ roughly 40-foot dive into a 12-foot pool. The pier’s proprietor, Anthony Catanoso, says his family canceled the event because it didn’t fit in with their modern vision for the New Jersey landmark’s renovation, but acknowledged the protesters’ impact on the decision, saying, “That negativity—we didn’t want that to interfere with the positive things we’re trying to do.” "
COK EXPOSES PIG ABUSE,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/cok-exposes-pig-abuse,"FEBRUARY 15, 2012","Today, animal-welfare group Compassion Over Killing announced the disturbing results of an undercover investigation of Hawkeye Sow Centers, an Iowa factory farm. During a late 2011 stint posing as a worker at the facility, a COK investigator witnessed and documented pigs confined to restrictive crates; workers castrating piglets without anesthetic or proper sanitation, sometimes botching the procedure and exposing their intestines; and the innards of dead piglets being cannibalistically added to the food supply for other pigs. HSC allegedly supplies for meat producer Hormel, which claimed recently that it will be phasing out the usage of gestation crates. Iowa produces more pork than any other state in the US, and an “ag-gag” anti-whistleblowing law—which would make exposés like COK’s illegal—is being circulated in the state right now. "

Animal testing for cosmetics, along with the sale and importing of animal-tested beauty products, was banned in the EU in 2009, with the exception of three tests, for which researchers were given until 2013 to find humane replacements. In response to news that the EU Health Commission is considering extending the 2013 deadline, Humane Society International launched the Cruelty-Free 2013 petition, a campaign supported by Lewis and fellow British stars such as Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench.

The almost two-and-a-half minute-long commercial, which features Willie Nelson covering Coldplay’s “The Scientist” as a soundtrack, first appeared online in September, but made its network television debut this week. Its animated narrative depicts farmers forgoing traditional small-scale business in favor of “big ag,” subsequently turning to antibiotics and assembly lines for their animals, only to “go back to the start” and return to less destructive practices. Media website zap2it.com states that the powerful commercial “may turn you vegetarian.” Sales from the track on iTunes will benefit the fast-food chain’s sustainable farming initiative, the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation.

The company plans on conducting an initial assessment of its suppliers, each of which will submit a proposal outlining their plans to eliminate the crates. Dan Gorsky, senior vice president of McDonald’s North America Supply Chain Management, says, “McDonald’s believes gestation stalls are not a sustainable production system for the future. There are alternatives that we think are better for the welfare of sows.” Late last year, Smithfield Foods, one of McDonald’s pork suppliers, announced its intention to phase out the use of gestation crates by 2017.

HAVE A HEART FOR FARM ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/have-a-heart-for-farm-animals,"FEBRUARY 12, 2012","Let’s face it: Farm animals have it rough. Sure, it’s all the problems related to factory farming, but it’s also just being, as one former president liked to put it, misunderestimated. Farm animals have fascinating abilities, quirky personalities, and many hidden talents that are grossly under-appreciated in our society. And now’s a good time to change that. Of course, there are millions of reasons to have a heart for the chickens, turkeys, pigs and cows, but here are five of my favorites. 1. Chickens may be the most romantically inclined of all farm animals. They create strong social bonds and, in a natural environment, males will call hens over to share their food, even picking up and dropping food repeatedly in front of a hen as an offering. Hens make devoted mothers, too. Research reveals that even before her chicks hatch, a hen will call to them, and they respond from within their eggs. John Webster, emeritus professor at Bristol University, said that the way a hen teaches her chicks what to eat, where to find food, and what to avoid “is pretty close to culture—and an advanced one at that.” 2. Studies prove that pigs are smarter than our canine friends. On video game tests (yes, pigs can play videogames using joysticks they control with their mouths), they can perform as well as primates. Like a cat’s whiskers, a pig’s snout provides her with heightened senses to navigate and interact with her environment. In fact, pigs’ noses are so sensitive that they can smell roots and tubers deep underground, a skill that’s been used for centuries to find truffles. 3. Science shows that cows are good at figuring out problems and take pleasure in finding solutions. Researchers who challenged cows to open a door to get food measured the animals’ neural activity and found that their “brainwaves showed the cows’ excitement [when they solved the problem]; their heartbeat went up and some even jumped into the air. We called it their Eureka moment.” 4. Did you know that Ben Franklin believed the turkey—not the bald eagle—should be America’s icon? “The turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America … a bird of courage,” Franklin said. His admiration was well founded. These birds are smart, fast, and indeed brave. And turkeys have something in common with peacocks, too. Ever seen a wild tom (male turkey) trying to romance a hen? With his tail feathers stretching up and wings jutting downward, he doubles his size in an attempt to woo the apple of his eye. 5. Need a fifth reason to have a heart for farm animals? Like dogs and cats, farm animals are individuals with personalities, preferences, and most importantly, a desire to enjoy life instead of suffer. This Valentine’s Day, you can have a heart for farm animals by sharing this article with your friends and family who may not yet understand who farm animals are, and encouraging them to sign up for the Humane Society of the United States’ Meatless Monday free weekly recipes! Paul Shapiro is the senior director of farm animal protection at The Humane Society of the United States. You can follow him on Twitter. "

The site set out to determine the overlap between what vegans actually eat and what their omnivorous counterparts perceive them to eat, as part of its Venn Food Diagram series. Unlike many of its past Venn Food inquiries, the vegan diagram displayed no discrepancies between the reality and perceptions of veganism. Meat-eating Angelenos correctly identified fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, legumes, and tofu as staples of the vegan diet, along with packaged fake meat products and ethnic foods. "

The nutrition and health experts cited in the article agree that adopting a plant-based diet is undoubtedly heart-healthy, but acknowledge the social and psychological hurdles some may face when attempting to follow a vegan diet. In response, some experts recommend that people transition to veganism with the help of a nutritionist, cookbooks, and websites, while others recommend easing into a plant-based diet by limiting animal products to occasional indulgences.

ETHICAL VEGAN SEX,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/ethical-vegan-sex,"FEBRUARY 9, 2012","In the age of stretchy cheese, scrumptious chick’n filets, and fashionable manmade shoes, it’s about time the sex industry caught up with humane alternatives. While most intimacy items found on drugstore shelves fail cruelty-free standards, there are many great options available online for conscious consumers. Condom Sense
One of the best ways to protect against unwanted pregnancies and STDs is to use a condom, but the traditional processing of latex involves casein, a milk protein. Fortunately there are several cruelty-free safe-sex alternatives on the market. Founded in Australia in 1990, vegan prophylactics and dental dam innovator Glyde has long since gone stateside with its ethical offerings. Particularly impressive is Glyde’s line of fruit-extract-flavored condoms in strawberry, blueberry, vanilla, and wild berry. While Glyde paved the way, newer companies, such as RFSU (Swedish Association for Sexuality Education) and Natural Sensation, have emerged to give consumers more options. Despite the uncomfortable cartoon packaging on RFSU’s products, they offer a wide selection of condoms, including one for increased sensitivity. For a non-latex option check out Natural Sensation’s condoms, made with synthetic resin. To try any one of these on for size, head over to one-stop online shop Vegan Essentials.

Contraception Conundrum
Veg women need to be especially careful when choosing a contraceptive since most hormone-based varieties, like the pill, patch, and implant, contain animal-derived ingredients and have been tested on animals. Oral contraceptives such as Lybrel and Lo Ovral, produced by pharmacy giant Wyeth, contain lactose. The good news is that Pfizer’s Depo-provera, a contraceptive injection, is in the clear (though its other products contain lactose and magnesium stearate). Representatives from Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceutical, Inc., manufacturers of the widely available Ortho-Evra contraceptive patch, confirmed that its product is also free from animal-derived ingredients. Behind Closed Doors
Once the issue of contraception is sorted out, it’s safe to set the mood. Since aromas can aid in arousal, invest in some soy-wax candles. Choices abound over at A Scent of Scandal, where sophisticated scent combinations come with clever names, such as “Morning Wood,” a mix of sandalwood and amber, and “original sin,” which blends fig leaves, lemons, dates, coconut, and musk. If candles don’t do the trick, try out some eco-friendly perfumes and colognes. Pacifica’s line of spray perfumes, especially the woody and resine fragrances, are perfect for getting-and keeping-attention. Men looking to find sensuous, eco-friendly products should explore the selection at Herban Cowboy. For the best in cruelty- and friction-free togetherness, The Sensual Vegan, a VN award-winning adult online store, offers a great selection of lubricants and toys. A classic and simple choice would be the flavorless Yes organic lube. To spice things up, check out one of Hathor Aphrodisia’s flavored lubricants, in hazelnut caramel, coconut orange, or chocolate strawberry. "
VEGAN RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/vegan-running-for-city-council,"FEBRUARY 8, 2012","San Diego-based public-interest attorney Bryan Pease, co-founder of the Animal Protection and Rescue League, is running for San Diego City Council in District 1. Pease, a devoted animal-rights activist, has been involved with several landmark legislative victories, including the passage of the California Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, which banned gestation crates and battery cages on California farms. Pease is running on a democratic platform in a campaign he says “will be entirely grassroots and funded on a shoestring budget.” In addition to his continued efforts to advocate for animal-welfare issues, Pease identified his political priorities as “environmental protection, governmental transparency, and fiscal responsibility.” "
COMPANIES RECALL EGG PRODUCTS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/companies-recall-egg-products,"FEBRUARY 8, 2012","In response to this week’s massive recall of hard-boiled eggs possibly contaminated with listeria, food suppliers across the country are recalling products that may have been prepared using Michael Foods’ eggs. A South Carolina company is recalling 2,800 chicken salad sandwiches distributed under a variety of brand names in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, and 389 pounds of egg-laden Cobb and spinach salads produced in New Jersey have also been recalled. According to Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, pails of hard-boiled eggs like the ones recalled by Michael Foods often spend weeks in commercial refrigerators, which provide a hospitable environment for bacteria such as listeria.

VEGAN ICE CREAM TRUCK CAMPAIGN,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/vegan-ice-cream-truck-campaign,"FEBRUARY 8, 2012","With the help of donations from vegan ice-cream lovers, Portland could be home to a new scoop-serving truck in the near future. Artisanal vegan ice-cream vendor Savor the Chill has launched an Indiegogo project in hopes of collecting funds to make a mobile truck serving the frozen treat a reality. The cart’s ice creams will be made with coconut or almond milk and all-organic ingredients, and will include flavors such as Ginger Snap Back, Stout at the Devil, Berry Your Dead, and White Chocolate Zombie. Savor the Chill hopes to collect $10,000 from Indiegogo donors by February 28, and the money will go towards purchasing a professional batch-freezer ice-cream machine and establishing wholesale accounts.

ETHICAL VALENTINE GIFTS FOR YOUR COMPASSIONATE SWEETHEART,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/ethical-valentine-gifts-for-your-compassionate-sweetheart,"FEBRUARY 8, 2012","If your sweetie doesn’t see bouquets or baubles on Valentine’s Day, you could be sleeping on the couch (or worse). But far worse than a cold shoulder is how those roses and cufflinks get into stores. From fossil fuels to farm-laborer exploitation, a whole host of nasty deeds go into many Valentine’s buds and studs. Fortunately, you can avoid harming both humans and the environment with a few tips. From Farms to Florists
Think factory farming is only for food? Think again. Almost 80 percent of the 4 billion cut flower stems purchased in the US come from flower farms in South America. Hundreds of acres are covered in chemicals and pesticides, seeping into the soil and contaminating water supplies. These chemicals have also caused workers to contract health problems such as skin rashes and respiratory problems. The workers, 70 percent of whom are female, have even been found to have higher-than-average rates of premature births and miscarriages. Additionally, the environmental cost incurred from transporting flowers to the US (including trucks, airplanes, and refrigerator vans) substantially contributes to global warming. From Terror to Tennis Bracelettes 
The gemstone and metal mining industries abuse both labor and environments to make everything from necklaces to watches. The diamond industry is a hotbed of violence—blood diamonds, or conflict diamonds, are diamonds that are sold to fund illegal military and terrorist groups in countries such as Angola, Liberia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Gold mining is also a toxic process. The most common method of extraction involves huge open-pit mines where earth is dug up and sprayed with cyanide to extract gold—to the tune of about 18 tons of mine waste for an 18 karat gold ring. The abandoned earth releases heavy doses of toxic chemicals into groundwater and streams. Labor law violations are common in these mines—for example, a February 2011 report on a gold mine in Papua New Guinea stated that workers had been physically and sexually assaulted by members of a private security force stationed at the mine. Earth-Friendly Florals
The absolute best way to make sure your flowers are cruelty-free and planet-friendly is to buy local and seasonal flowers. If roses are the only option, buy flowers at Organic Bouquet or Organic Style, two companies that are committed to eco- and human-friendly flower production. If you really want to get your Martha Stewart on this year, how about making some flowers of your own? Use recycled paper to make a permanent, handmade (with love!) bouquet. Feel-Good Jewelry
The best advice for jewelry shopping is simple: ask! If you’re hunting for diamonds, make sure it has a Kimberley Process certification—a system put in place in 2003 to document and track all rough diamonds to ensure they came from conflict-free mines. To ensure that metals like gold and silver have been processed using green practices, you can ask your jeweler or check with Earthworks to confirm the metals came from a mine where workers are treated fairly and mine waste is disposed of responsibly. Additionally, you can buy jewelry from recycled or sustainable materials such as silver and bamboo, or a recycled owner—vintage jewelry is unique and timeless. With these tips, this year’s Valentine’s gift will not only look lovely but will also be guilt-free. Your ethical bouquet of roses or diamond necklace will have your partner—and the world—feeling the love. "
APRL FOIE GRAS INVESTIGATION,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/aprl-foie-gras-investigation,"FEBRUARY 7, 2012","Hot in Cleveland actress Wendie Malick is the narrator of a recent Animal Protection and Rescue League video revealing the mistreatment of ducks on foie-gras factory farms. Foie gras, French for “fatty liver,” is produced by force-feeding ducks until their livers become severely enlarged—a process that has led to a pre-slaughter mortality rate up to 20 times higher than other duck factory farms. An industry-wide investigation into the practice conducted from 2002 to 2004 prompted a statewide ban on force-feeding in California, effective this year, and caused foie-gras producers to vow to make the process more humane. However, APRL’s new video, portions of which were filmed in 2011, exposes the continued inhumane treatment of ducks on New York and California farms. "
CAVIAR FISH DECLARED ENDANGERED,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/caviar-fish-declared-endangered,"FEBRUARY 7, 2012","Overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction have severely depleted East Coast populations of once-plentiful Atlantic sturgeon, leading officials from the National Marine Fisheries Service to declare it an endangered species. Sturgeon has been in high demand for decades because of its prized caviar, and increased demand has significantly decreased populations. Now, sturgeon is at risk of extinction in the entire New York Bight, an area that covers the Chesapeake, Carolina, and South Atlantic populations, as well as the Delaware and Hudson rivers. Federal officials report that the number of female sturgeon spawning in the Delaware River has dropped from 180,000 in 1890 to an estimated 300 today. "
GREECE BANS ANIMAL CIRCUSES,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/greece-bans-animal-circuses,"FEBRUARY 6, 2012","Four days ago, Greece became the first European nation to ban the use of animals in its circuses, responding to pressure from animal-welfare groups Animal Defenders International and Greek Animal Welfare Fund. More than 50 local animal-protection agencies expressed their support for the campaign, which was launched in 2006 by ADI. The new law also mandates that it is henceforth forbidden to use animals in amusement parks, concerts, exhibitions, fairs, and festivals. In 2009, Bolivia became the first country in the world to ban circus animals. While Greece is the only country in Europe to take the measure, several other nations—including Austria, Portugal, Denmark, and Croatia—are currently working to implement similar bans. "
PETA’S SEAWORLD LAWSUIT,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/petas-seaworld-lawsuit,"FEBRUARY 6, 2012","Yesterday, a federal judge in San Diego addressed the issue of whether or not animals are protected under the Constitution’s 13th Amendment, which outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude. The issue is central to a controversial lawsuit filed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals against SeaWorld, in which PETA accused the theme park of enslaving five high-performing orcas. In response, SeaWorld filed a motion to have the case dismissed, calling the lawsuit a “publicity stunt” with no legal merit. The US District Court judge presiding over the case did not make an immediate ruling, but PETA declared the hearing a victory, saying it was the first time animals were considered under the 13th Amendment. "
PETITION TARGETS KARDASHIANS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/petition-targets-kardashians,"FEBRUARY 6, 2012","Frequent fur-wearers the Kardashians are the target of a new online petition urging the fashionista clan to stop selling fur at their boutique chain Dash. Models Joanna Krupa and Katie Cleary, who started the petition, are outraged at the reality-TV family’s repeated use of fur in their various retail ventures, as well as for personal use, citing their responsibility as role models and trendsetters to set a good example for their impressionable fans. In a recent interview about the petition, Krupa expressed disappointment in Khloe Kardashian, who posed for a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals anti-fur campaign in 2008. Currently, the petition has gathered more than 21,000 of its goal of 30,000 signatures.   Photo credit: CNN "

SUPPLIER RECALLS EGGS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/supplier-recalls-eggs,"FEBRUARY 5, 2012","A Minnesota food supplier is recalling cooked eggs from 34 states due to the possibility of listeria contamination. Michael Foods, which processes the most eggs worldwide, is recalling 10- and 25-pound pails of hard-cooked eggs that were distributed for institutional use under various brand names. Though the US Food and Drug Administration says there have been no reported illnesses linked to the eggs, Michael Foods is withdrawing the products as a precautionary measure due to their potential to sicken individuals with weak immune systems. The company has identified the likely source of the contamination as a repair project in the packaging room of its Wakefield, NE location. "
VEGAN SLIDERS,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/vegan-sliders,"FEBRUARY 5, 2012","When planning winning snacks for the perfect game-day party, what could be more quintessential than nachos, brewskies, and sliders? White Castle may have invented these meaty munchkins, but it’s 2012, and they’ve gone vegan in all of their salty, smoky, satisfying little glory. Awaiting condiments and dairy-free cheese or just dang good on their own, Gardein’s Ultimate Sliders scored a touchdown with the VN staff and left us eager for more.

Vanessa Rees
Brooklyn-based photographer Vanessa Rees not only has an array of beautiful still-lifes and portraits, but also a dedicated “Nom Nom Nom” board with craveworthy, mostly vegan dishes gathered from around the web.

As if we needed another reason to adore Daiya and all of its splendorous uses, the company offers dozens of ideas for cooking with its three varieties of dairy-free cheeses. We came for the butternut squash and kale mac ‘n’ cheese; we stayed for the board of cute baby animals. Shape
Don’t get us wrong—we could never get enough gorgeous vegan recipes and adorable photos of baby animals.

Hormel is best known as the producer of SPAM, but also produces brand names such as Dinty Moore, Stagg, Jennie-O, and more, and has 54,000 breeding pigs in total. The announcement was made just six weeks after Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer, made the same pledge, and just days after Humane Society of the United States released undercover video footage of pigs suffering in gestation crates at the facilities of Seaboard Foods, the nation’s third-largest pork producer. "
SCIENTISTS SLAM SUGAR,https://vegnews.com/2012/2/scientists-slam-sugar,"FEBRUARY 2, 2012","A team of scientists from the University of California, San Francisco argues in a new paper that sugar is primarily to blame for widespread instances of chronic illness around the world. The report, published in international science journal Nature, likens sugar to addictive, harmful substances such as alcohol and tobacco, and says that excessive consumption of sugar alters the body’s biochemistry, leaving people susceptible to a wide range of life-threatening conditions. To intervene in what they view as a public health crisis, the UCSF scientists advocate for taxes on sugar-laden products, and for drastic legislation that would limit children’s access to highly sweetened beverages and foods.

VEGAN VALENTINES,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/vegan-valentines,"JANUARY 31, 2012","The season of smooching is upon us. Whether we like it or not, Valentine’s Day is our yearly occassion to celebrate love. Savvy singles, happy couples, and those who fall somewhere along the middle of the spectrum can all appreciate whatever it is we love in life. A caring, considerate partner brightens any day, but so does loving a cruelty-free lifestyle, rescuing a companion animal, or treating yourself as well as humanly possible. Here are a few ideas to infuse your life with love—romantics rejoice! Why Do You Build Me Up, Buttercup?
On Valentine’s Day, nobody wants to be let down, nor is anyone out there really hoping to be messed around. Worst of all? Not calling is a pretty damaging diss on this ultra-sweet holiday, but even worse is gifting your beloved with buttercups (or, more likely, roses) that are damaging to the environment and to the farmers who grow them. Check out these handy tips for sourcing Eco-Friendly Flowers to ensure that your buds aren’t duds (environmentally speaking). The Pick-Up Artist
Pick-up lines can range from come-hither whispers that set your toes atingle to downright cheesy come-ons that get you absolutely nowhere. Trying to determine which one of these two options your line exemplifies can be harder than itemizing your taxes while blindfolded. Our favorite trick to using pick up lines is: use sparingly, and use only with your friends. That’s right, picking up your friends is always a much better time than trying to actually talk to someone intimidatingly attractive. Would you rather have an evening of uproarious laughter, or an evening of mortification? We’ll take the former, please! Of course, veg-themed pick-up lines get extra points. Our Top 10 Veg-Themed Pick-Up Lines are sure to tickle your friends’ funny bones. Eat Your Heart Out
It should be clear by now that the way to any person’s heart is through the stomach. Cooking a dynamite dinner is a fantastic way to show your affections any time of year, and today’s no exception. Whether you’re hoping to win the heart of your latest crush, reignite the spark with your long-time steady, or just turn someone new on to veganism, a well-planned meal can do the trick. First, take a gander at these utterly appropriate Heart-Shaped Foods, and then try combining the shapely theme with these Vegan Aphrodisiacs. Are all the aprhodisiacs food? Yes. Do we recommend eating them all at once? No. Or if you do, at least make sure to have a mint on hand! Animal Amour
Obviously, we’re suckers for all kinds of cute critters. Aside from the obvious step of leaving animals off your Valentine’s Day dinner plate, sharing your love with a furry friend is an excellent way to soak in the spirit of the sappy season. From showering your pampered pooch with organic dog treats, to enjoying the stories of animals who’ve made it safely to sanctuaries all around the country, take some time today to remember the special place in your life that non-human animals hold. Me, Myself, and I
Finally, there’s one person who needs special attention today, no matter what kind of relationship you are (or aren’t!) in: you. Treating ourselves like loved ones can be difficult in the midst of busy schedules and hectic lives. But taking the time to really care for ourselves sets us up for success in all of our other endeavors. Can you be your most witty, charming, seductive self when you’re sleep deprived, hungry, or lethargic? Not likely. Whether it’s attending an extra yoga class, running a mile longer than usual, taking the time to meditate regularly, or simply indulging in a hot sauna followed by a luxurious massage at a veg-friendly spa, don’t forget the person who’s your valentine every year: you!

FLORIDA AG GAG BILL FAILS,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/florida-ag-gag-bill-fails,"JANUARY 31, 2012","Much like the proposed “ag-gag” bills that failed in 2011, Florida’s Senate Agriculture Committee and House Criminal Justice Subcommittee recently removed language from a proposed bill that would have criminalized taking both videos and photographs on factory farms without explicit permission. Florida’s animal producers have a history of violating humane-treatment standards, including a Miami-Dade slaughterhouse that was closed after the results of an undercover investigation released in November 2011 documented heinous animal cruelty and blood leaking from the plant. Workers’ rights advocates joined animal-protection advocates in praising the committee’s decision, as the removed language would have also made it illegal to document worker-safety violations, sexual harassment, or embezzlement.   "
BARKER AND PCRM FIGHT TESTING,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/barker-and-pcrm-fight-testing,"JANUARY 31, 2012","Former host of The Price Is Right Bob Barker has joined the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in the fight to end the use of cats for medical experiments at the University of Virginia. In an open letter to the university’s president, Teresa A. Sullivan, Barker expresses his concern for the suffering of cats used in its pediatrics residency-training program, which requires students to force plastic tubes into the mouths and tracheas of the animals. Barker suggests transitioning to human-patient simulators, a move that 94 percent of pediatrics residency programs have already made.

HSUS REVEALS PIG ABUSE,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/hsus-reveals-pig-abuse,"JANUARY 31, 2012","Today, The Humane Society of the United States filed complaints against two of the largest pork suppliers in the US following an undercover investigation that revealed the abuse of pigs. The animal-welfare organization infiltrated two Oklahoma facilities owned by Seaboard Foods and Prestage Farms—the nation’s third- and fifth-largest pork producers, respectively—and discovered lame and diseased pigs denied veterinary care, distressed and suffering pigs confined within tiny gestation crates, and piglets being castrated without anesthetic. HSUS filed the legal complaints with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission, disputing Seaboard’s claim that it uses “the most humane practices throughout the animal’s life,” which could qualify as a false and misleading statement.

TED DANSON GOES VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/ted-danson-goes-vegan,"JANUARY 30, 2012","Actor Ted Danson has adopted a vegan diet in order to maintain a high energy level on the set of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. According to contactmusic.com, Danson decided to go vegan after filming back-to-back episodes of the hit crime drama began to take a toll on his physical well-being. Roughly six months later, the TV star says he feels energized, remarking, “I feel good and I look fabulous.” This is not the first time Danson has limited animal products in his diet for health reasons.

CHAINS STOP USE OF CHEMICAL BEEF,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/chains-stop-use-of-chemical-beef,"JANUARY 30, 2012","Several of the largest fast-food chains in the US—including McDonald’s, Taco Bell, and Burger King—have announced that they will no longer be using ammoniated beef, also known as “pink slime” in the industry. McDonald’s made the decision partially in response to a campaign by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, who drew attention to the chain’s practices and denounced the controversial substance. “Pink slime” is made by adding ammonia and water to fatty beef trimmings in order to kill bacteria, and the subsequent product is then sold for use as hamburger filler or pet food. Food Safety News reports that at one point, ammoniated meat was used in roughly 70 percent of ground beef in the US. "

In a January 24 article in The Herald News, the vegan blogger-turned-entrepreneur describes how an unanticipated layoff led her to launch Dirty Vegan Foods, her homage to the retro sweets she enjoyed as a kid. Dirty Vegan Foods currently offers more than a dozen products, including a veganized version of Hostess Twinkies and Ding Dongs, but Gill plans on expanding the company’s inventory to include more cruelty-free creations. In addition to being available online and at Rhode Island Whole Foods, Dirty Vegan Foods will be available at the supermarket chain’s Boston-area locations this year. "

Secretary Vislack suggests to move in order to save money, and predicts that $95 million can be cut from the agency’s budget for the first three years after implementation. Food and Water Watch, a consumer-rights organization, opposes the move, saying that it will give the poultry industry too much free reign.

BRYANT TERRY ON (VEGAN) FOOD POLITICS,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/bryant-terry-on-vegan-food-politics,"JANUARY 29, 2012","We may only be a few weeks into the new year, but author and food activist Bryant Terry already has plenty on his literal and figurative plate. Between penning his third book The Inspired Vegan: Seasonal Ingredients, Creative Recipes, Mouthwatering Menus and hosting the new web series Urban Organic, Terry is using his culinary prowess and progressive knowledge of food politics to make changes on a scale from dinner plates to entire communities. We caught up with Terry the day after his book-launch party to hear more about his inspirations, goals, and theories about putting the passion back into vegan cuisine. VegNews: How do the recipes in The Inspired Vegan vary from those found in your previous books, Vegan Soul Kitchen and Grub?
Bryant Terry: All three of my books have the texture of autobiography—I share what’s happening in my own personal life, what’s happening to me politically, and what I’ve been consuming and enjoying. So, this book was written throughout the time that I was in the process of getting married, and my wife’s cooking deeply influences not only what I eat, but also my approach in general. My wife is Chinese-American, and she is adept at cooking a range of Asian foods from Chinese to Vietnamese to Thai. We have intentionally combined our cultural food styles, especially after having a daughter last April. We really want our daughter to embrace both her Chinese-American side and her African-American side, and the foods that come along with each culture. Another important aspect of this book is the structure around menus. One of the questions I frequently get when I’m speaking—especially from people who have transitioned from an omnivorous diet to a plant-based diet, to vegetarian or vegan—is how to put together well-balanced, delicious, interesting meals if meat isn’t at the center of the plate. I wanted to use this book as an opportunity to educate people about putting together sumptuous vegan meals that are interesting, exciting, and cutting-edge.  VN: Your daughter is going to have some awesome school lunches! Speaking of other aspects that make this book unique, what made you decide to include the song and book pairings with each dish?
BT: Our industrial food system has made food items into commodities, and I think that there’s a chasm that has come out wherein food is on one side and art, culture, and community are separate. When I consider my own upbringing, eating a meal wasn’t just a way to fuel yourself—it was about gathering at the table and enjoying the sensual pleasures of cooking. Meals were about harvesting the fresh food that my family was growing in their backyard garden and then collectively taking part in the preparation of it, gathering and talking and connecting. I come from a very musical family. My relatives were always playing the piano, singing, and having fun. When we finally sat down at the table, it was a very festive moment where we shared what was going on in our lives. I just don’t think I could ever write a book that didn’t include soundtracks and ideas, because those are the ways that food has been so central to my life. VN: You cite your grandparents as major influences for your interest in food. What activities or lessons did they share with you that shaped your passion for cooking and for food activism?
BT: One of the main lessons that I learned from my grandparents is that growing one’s own food is vital for self-determination. I think about the fact that my paternal grandfather used every bit of available space in his backyard to grow food. And he lived in the city! When I think about my food and cooking, I have the political objective to move people to be more active and create a more helpful, just, and sustainable food system, and I have my ideas about why I think it’s important that we all contribute to a compassionate food system and advocate for the rights of animals. VN: Is there a particular type of person or group that you envision as your audience or are hoping to reach specifically with your food?
BT: One of the things that I’ve been so excited about is that I have such a diverse audience. In terms of my activist self, I certainly understand that in this country we’re looking at a moment in history where we’re one of the sickest and one of the most obese nations. I also understand that there are certain communities that are deeply impacted by these issues, whether it’s poor white people living in rural Appalachia, or historically, marginalized African Americans living in urban centers. There are diverse groups of people living in food-insecure situations in the United States. I’m interested in illuminating the deep-seated issues that I know these communities are facing, because I know that often these issues are overlooked and these people feel voiceless. But then there’s another part of me that just loves making tasty vegan food, and knows that I have the power to continue to shift perceptions about vegan food and educate people about how you can have such a diverse and varied plant-based diet, such flavorful and delicious meals made just from vegan foods and not have to have any animal products. VN: Do you view The Inspired Vegan and your new web series Urban Organic as being related, or do you have separate or unique goals for each?
BT: I see them as being related, certainly, going back to part of my mission ensuring that I connect with the most impacted and the most food-insecure communities, that I can help spread knowledge about preparing wholesome, healthful meals. A lot of that is encouraging people to think about not only the existing cutting-edge solutions for bringing healthful food into cities, but also helping people understand that we don’t have to have advanced degrees, run some multimillion dollar NGO, or have a cookbook to be active in this role of helping communities around the US. That’s what I want to prove when I’m interacting with the Urban Organic communities. VN: Why do you think the belief persists that veganism is a privileged white person phenomenon?
BT: Most of the catalysts for my embracing vegetarianism—and then veganism—came from people of color. The first moment when I really thought about animal rights and a compassionate outlook was when I heard the song “Beef” by Boogie Down Productions and the rapper KRS-One. It was such a brilliant, articulate discussion of the horrors of factory farming and what animals have to endure. I also read this book by African-American activist and comedian Dick Gregory, Dick Gregory’s Natural Diet For Folks Who Eat: Cookin’ with Mother Nature, in which he talks about his journey of going from an omnivore to a vegetarian and a vegan and a fruitarian, and that was deeply impactful. I started connecting with this community of folks in Memphis who were Rastafarians, who were Seventh-Day Adventists, who were people in the Nation of Islam, who all had vegan diets. Before that, I had been in the straight-edge punk community, which was made of conscious white folks who were thinking about these issues, but I pretty much always hung around vegans of color. So many things that people of color do aren’t illuminated in the media or shown to the wider culture. If you never go into an African-American community or go into an Afro-Caribbean community, how would you even know that they have five or six vegan restaurants? One of my missions as well as a cookbook author is to ensure that African American and Afro-Caribbean cuisine isn’t “ghetto-ized” or approached in a very patronizing way. I want to let people know that they can have a healthful meal of African-American cuisine, beyond stereotypes, beyond this very narrow perception. VN: What direction or what light do you see food politics going into in the next 10 or 20 years?
BT: The direction I hope it continues in is toward solutions for food insecurity, for problems that people are facing in the US due to lack of access to healthful sustainable foods. All too often I’ll see well-meaning, altruistic, beautiful people who have a desire to work in and address food insecurity issues in communities that they don’t come from. There are some complicated race and class issues around that, but if one has the resources, the desire, and the access to information to be an ally for many of these impacted communities then I applaud that. However, if outside people aren’t working to fundamentally shift the power and ensure that the people living in those communities are in charge of contributing to the ideas of and guiding the solutions for the pervasive problems, I don’t think it will be as effective, and I don’t think it’s as authentic. It’s about helping communities build that power and be self-determined. "

Prominent health and nutrition experts—including Caldwell Esselstyn and Kathy Freston—appear in the video, explaining how heart health and vascular function are deeply intertwined with sexual function and enjoyment. Animal products such as meat and cheese can clog arteries, leading to decreased blood flow to all areas of the body—including the ones used in the bedroom. “Vegan is the new Viagra,” Freston declares in the short film.

ANIMAL DRUG CONTROVERSY,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/animal-drug-controversy,"JANUARY 25, 2012","Controversial livestock drug ractopamine hydrochloride is at the center of an international trade dispute, MSNBC reports. The drug is administered to an estimated 60 to 80 percent of pigs raised in the US, as well as other livestock, in order to reduce the animals’ fat content and increase their growth. While the Food and Drug Administration has deemed ractopamine safe for human consumption at low levels, the drug has sickened or killed more pigs than any other livestock drug, leading to international concern over its health implications. Currently, key markets such as the European Union, China, and Taiwan have all banned the use of ractopamine and, as a result, are rejecting some US meat exports. The Obama administration has declared resolving the dispute a top agricultural priority, trade officials say. "

Requirements in the bill include the gradual abolition of battery cages, enriched environments for hens that allow them to engage in natural behaviors, labeling of cartons to provide transparency about the welfare standards of each company, and more. While HSUS supports the bill because of its increased concern for the comfort and safety of hens, the UEP also sides with it because it will resolve state-by-state inconsistencies in policy that creates conflict in the industry’s commerce.

The law won the vote in 2009, but cannot go into effect due to its violation of federal regulations instituted by Congress that control slaughterhouse policy. California sought stronger laws concerning sick and immobile livestock following an HSUS undercover investigation in 2008 that showed workers abusing and dragging downed cows at a Southern California facility. The National Meat Association considers the Supreme Court’s ruling a victory, while animal-welfare activists are dismayed by the decision. "

10 REASONS WE NEED DENNIS KUCINICH IN CONGRESS,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/10-reasons-we-need-dennis-kucinich-in-congress,"JANUARY 23, 2012","With the 2010 US Census came the usual reapportionment of Congressional seats, shifting the number of representatives each state is allocated based on the state’s change in population. The state of Ohio, from where our nation’s lone vegan Representative hails, is losing two seats (as is New York), while Florida is gaining two and Texas gaining four. The Ohio powers-that-be have combined two Cleveland-area districts, both of which lean heavily Democratic, into one. Rep. Dennis Kucinich represents one of those two districts, and he is currently in a very tight primary re-election campaign. The Ohio primary takes place on Tuesday, March 6, and it is a fair bet that the winner of the Democratic primary will win the Congressional seat this fall.  In other words, the election that takes place six weeks from today is the real election. I believe it is important to have a voice in Washington standing up for many of the same issues I believe in, and that is why I’m supporting Congressman Dennis Kucinich in his re-election bid. If you aren’t familiar with Dennis’ record, take a few minutes to get to know him and his policies a little better: 1. Dennis is the leading spokesperson for peace in the Congress. He is the author of the Department of Peace legislation, and he led Democrats in opposing the Bush Iraq War resolution. He is also the recent winner of the Peace Abbey’s Courage of Conscience Award for his tireless advocacy of non-violent conflict resolution in international affairs. Dennis wants to change the US role in the world from one of aggression and dominance to one of cooperation. 2. Dennis is the leading advocate of protecting the globe through reducing carbon emissions; transitioning from coal, oil, and nuclear to wind and solar micro-technologies; and tapping the inventive genius of NASA for environmental solutions through new technologies. 3. As far as I know, Dennis is the only vegan in Congress, his diet and lifestyle an extension of his commitment to nonviolence, compassion, and sustainability. He is also a major spokesperson for supporting locally grown food through regional farm-to-market strategies, and the author of a bill to label and safety test all GMO products. 4. Dennis is married to Elizabeth Kucinich, one of our nation’s leading advocates for diet-based health solutions, as well as a well-known animal-rights activist. Elizabeth is Government Affairs Director for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. 5. As the United Nations Representative for Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, Dennis is a leading voice for nuclear disarmament. 6. Dennis is author of Constitutional Amendment HJ Res. 100, which would forbid all private-money contributions in federal elections. 7. He’s also the driving force behind HR 2990, the National Emergency Employment Defense Act (NEED Act), which would create millions of private sector jobs and rebuild America’s infrastructure while paying off the national debt, all without raising taxes. 8. Along with Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), Dennis is author of HR 676, the bill to create a universal, single-payer, not-for-profit-health care system. 9. And he’s the author of the Universal Prekindergarten Act, which would make it possible for all children, ages three to five, to have access to full-time pre-kindergarten education. 10. And finally, Dennis is a proponent of Universal College Education, which would enable every young person to attend a public college or university tuition-free. These are just 10 of the reasons I support Dennis Kucinich for Congress. To learn more about Dennis and support his campaign, please visit his website. Do we really want to imagine a Congress without his voice? VN Publisher Joseph Connelly first interviewed Rep. Dennis Kucinich in 2003 when he was running for US president. "
5 FITNESS MUST-READS,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/5-fitness-must-reads,"JANUARY 22, 2012","Going to the gym, cleaning up our diets, and generally de-cluttering our lives are at the top of everyone’s priority list when January 1 strikes. But as the new year becomes less and less new, our resolutions to get healthy can start to fall by the wayside. The good news is that there’s a cadre of vegan experts who are just waiting to help us get back on track. Well, technically their out living their lives, but they’ve each penned a pivotal book that incorporates sure-fire strategies for excellent health. Here are five books that will help keep your resolve (and your biceps) strong all year long.

Power Moves: The Four Motions to Transform Your Body for Life by Marco Borges
Borges isn’t just a personal trainer to the stars (though he is that, too—note the foreword to this book by Jay-Z), he’s also the founder of 22Days Nutrition, a vegan energy bar company. His training philosophy stems from four power moves, each of which is based on the shoulder, elbow, hip, or knee. Borges’ energy is infectious, and his passion for helping people create better health in their lives is limitless. And his success speaks for itself—Jay-Z might have 99 problems, but being out of shape ain’t one.

Crazy Sexy Diet: Eat Your Veggies, Ignite Your Spark, and Live Like You Mean It! by Kris Carr
Part nutrition primer, part vegan advocacy tome, and part 21-day cleanse guide, this book has it all. Carr’s incurable cancer diagnosis spurred her to action to take charge of her own health, and charge she did. Armed with a vivacious personality that comes through clearly on each page, Carr informs, inspires, and instructs on how to optimize not just the health of one’s body, but also the clarity of our minds, and the passion with which we live.

Vegan Bodybuilding & Fitness by Robert Cheeke
Fresh off a feature in The New York Times on vegan bodybuilding, there’s never been a better time to pick up Cheeke’s book. Cheeke is serious about bulking up on plant-based protein (and he has the guns to prove it). Don’t be scared off of this one for fear that you’ll end up in a Borat-style Speedo with a spray tan—Cheeke makes sure that even newbie fitness enthusiasts can find his book helpful.

Thrive Fitness: The Vegan-Based Training Program for Maximum Strength, Health, and Fitness by Brendan Brazier
Brazier is an Ironman triathlete—aka a crazy person. From someone whose livelihood has depended on his fitness level for years, he’s incredibly well-versed in exactly what it takes to build a healthy, fit body on plants. He’s another food-company founder, having started Vega in after creating his own recovery drinks and energy bars to power his workouts. Brazier focuses on what, specifically, athletes should eat to fuel their bodies efficiently.

Finding Ultra: Rejecting Middle Age, Becoming One of the World’s Fittest Men, and Discovering Myself by Rich Roll
OK, this one’s a bit of a cheat: The book isn’t out yet (but will be come early May). Rich Roll, however, has already inspired the VN staff aplenty with his story of couch-to-completely insane levels of fitness. You know how sometimes people tell you that they’ve run a marathon, and you’re (rightly) impressed? Roll ran five Ironman-distance triathlons (yes, those include full marathons, plus swimming and biking legs) in one week. Oh, and he didn’t start training until he was in his 40s. No big deal. We can’t wait to hear what this plant-powered athlete has to say about getting extra, ultra, super fit. "
ABUSE REGISTRIES PENDING,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/abuse-registries-pending,"JANUARY 22, 2012","Efforts to establish online animal abuser registries are gaining momentum across the country, with legislation currently in the works in five states. According to The Los Angeles Times, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, and New York have all proposed new legislation that would require convicted animal abusers to register with law enforcement, much in the same way sex offenders do. The registries would follow the model set forth in Suffolk County, NY, which created the nation’s first public animal abuser database in 2010. Proponents of the measures believe that registries would reduce and prevent incidences of animal abuse by barring convicted abusers from adopting or buying animals. "

VEGANISM SAVED MY LIFE!,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/veganism-saved-my-life,"JANUARY 22, 2012","In the feature “Veganism Saved My Life” from our January+February issue, we highlighted five amazing stories of people who transformed their health and achieved a new lease on life by adopting a vegan diet. After watching their health deteriorate for months or years, these remarkable individuals utilized a plant-based diet for their personal restoration and relief from disease, fatigue, and pain. With the help of VegNews correspondent and Our Hen House co-founder Jasmin Singer, we spoke to three more people who revitalized their bodies and attitudes by going meat- and dairy-free. The Meaty Midwesterner
When now-55-year-old Randy Hale was a child in Madison Park, OK, he ate the meat-heavy diet for which the Midwest is well-known. “Everything circled around beef—maybe one day a week we’d have some other meat, like chicken or some pork,” Hale recalls. “In terms of vegetables, I really only grew up eating three, which were corn, fried potatoes, and beans.” Instead of an apple or banana, he would down a spoonful of crunchy sugar right out of the jar when the craving struck for something sweet. As he grew older, Hale saw virtually everyone around him developing similar health problems. “This lifestyle was just passed down from generation to generation,” he explains. “So growing up, I expected as I aged, I would hurt like they do, I would be on medications like they were. I would have an issue with diabetes or some heart disease.” Ten years ago, Hale experienced a self-fulfilling prophecy when he visited the doctor and discovered that he had developed high blood pressure, unsafe cholesterol levels, and type 2 diabetes. Although he promised his doctor that he would make changes toward improving his health, he continued to indulge in a fatty, meat-heavy diet—until he talked to his friend, Steve Ryan, who “pestered [him] about how easy this diet was, this lifestyle change.”  Ryan had experienced amazing results from going vegan, and encouraged Hale to do the same. When Hale picked up a copy of Neal Barnard, MD’s Program for Reversing Diabetes, he wasn’t sure what to expect, but he was willing to give it a shot. On the 13th day of the diet, Hale began experiencing remarkable changes. His blood sugar levels had returned to normal. Hale works on a national wildlife refuge, and when he got there that day, he hiked six miles and “felt unbelievable,” in his words. Hale recalls, “Before, I would never, ever have done that, because I was all bent out of shape and heavy [and had] pains in my joints and my ankle. My arthritis was bad from my waist down, my lower back—I would be miserable, whether I was active or not. But on the 13th day, my blood sugar dropped, my energy level skyrocketed, and I didn’t hurt, so that enabled me to get out and become active.” Astounded, Hale returned to his doctor on the 21st day of his vegan diet to find that he had already lost more than 14 pounds and no longer needed his diabetes medication. Hale has been vegan since August 2011, and in addition to losing 44 pounds himself, he has already helped more than 14 people adopt a plant-based diet. Before going vegan, Hale had never tried Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, collard greens, beets, turnips, or sweet potatoes, all of which he now consumes voraciously. “It’s like there’s this big heavy dark curtain that was around me when I was growing up, and it limited my vision, so I couldn’t see myself being healthy or not being on medication or being active,” he describes. “[Now] I can see myself being healthy, living to be 95, and maybe being medication-free.” He’s also adamant in his belief that anyone can give up meat and dairy, laughing, “It’s not hard to convert from a meat-loving carnivore to a little friendlier vegan. My friends, they would think I’m the last guy to become a vegan.” The End of Endometriosis
Katherine Lawrence was an engineer at Bell Helicopter, happily living in Fort Worth, TX. While she had an accomplished career in the United States Air Force as an aerospace engineer, Lawrence enjoyed spending much of her free time cooking and preparing gourmet, meat- and dairy-laden meals for friends, classmates, and troops. Unbeknownst to her, Lawrence was about to receive a major wake-up call that would make her reconsider how her diet and health were intertwined. In 2006, Lawrence began to experience severe pain in her abdomen. After months of tests, she was diagnosed with severe endometriosis, a female reproductive disorder that causes overgrowth of tissue in the pelvic area and localized cysts, causing pain, irregular bleeding, and possibly infertility. Seeing no other alternatives, Lawrence’s doctor sadly informed her that there was no cure for her condition, and suggested that she pursue surgery and a hysterectomy to alleviate her pain. Faced with the prospect of never being able to have children, she researched holistic medicine and sought alternatives, eventually making the decision to switch from the Standard American Diet to a low-fat, plant-based regimen. After only five weeks on a vegan diet, Lawrence saw major results, as her doctor informed her that 95 percent of her endometriosis had disappeared. Her doctor was also shocked to find that within a matter of months, her reproductive system had healed, and additionally, she sported lower cholesterol, clearer skin, and shrinking fibroid cysts in her breasts. Within two years, Lawrence was able to conceive and give birth to a healthy (vegan) baby boy. In addition to being able to start a family, she lost 40 pounds and improved her overall health. Astounded by the effects of a plant-based lifestyle, Katherine pursued a certificate in Plant-Based Nutrition from Cornell University’s online program, being accepted as an instructor for nonprofit The Cancer Project in 2008. Recently, Katherine has offered her vegan culinary expertise for the web cooking series Delectable Planet, and assists a program for insurance-company Geico that aims to inform its employees about the benefits of a plant-based diet. The Leukemia Survivor
In 1983, when she was 26 years old, Christina Pirello (then Hayes) was given a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia and told she had six to nine months to live. “I had just watched my mother die at 49 of colon cancer,” Pirello remembers, “and I knew I could not go through that.” It was her mother’s suffering with conventional medicine, followed by her ultimate and untimely demise, that caused a terrified Pirello to make the decision to not pursue allopathic treatment. Her doctor saw no hope, and neither did she. Around that time, a friend introduced her to a man who, according to Christina, “thought he might have advice that could help me save my life.” Robert Pirello—who would later become her husband—had been a long proponent and follower of a vegan macrobiotic diet, high in whole grains, lightly cooked vegetables, legumes, seaweed, healthy fats, and miso. “Robert ate this weird diet and said it could cure cancer. I was skeptical, obviously.” So were her doctors, who told her that regardless of what treatment she pursued, she should get her affairs in order. Christina had been vegetarian since she was 14, but ate a lot of processed foods, making sure they were “loaded with butter and cheese.” It wasn’t until she was diagnosed with cancer that she even considered the effect that dairy had on health, and, thanks to Robert’s guidance, understood the healing that can come with a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich foods. She also found a community in her town of Philadelphia, and started attending weekly dinners and lectures that focused on the benefits of a macrobiotic diet. To her astonishment, her body started to heal itself. “The vegan macrobiotic approach to eating changes the pH of your blood, creating an alkalized body and blood chemistry—as opposed to acidic, which we are when we are ill,” she explains. “By alkalizing the blood, you can alter the pH and create an atmosphere where your body can heal from any number of conditions.” This radical shift in her diet led to a radical recovery. “After about eight months of ups and downs, into remission and out, I stayed in remission, moved into what they called spontaneous regression, and after 14 months, was declared cancer-free.” Pirello’s transformation led her to study Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, pursue a Masters Degree in Nutrition, and eventually found The Christina Pirello School of Natural Cooking and Integrative Health Studies in Philadelphia. “Now I teach cooking all over the world,” Christina beams. “People want to be healthy. I am convinced they are just confused and lost in information overload. If I can just show them simple truths, proven by science, they can change.” These three survivors and countless others have literally saved their own lives with a plant-based diet.

GERMANY SEEKS WELFARE LABELS,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/germany-seeks-welfare-labels,"JANUARY 19, 2012","In a new charter released Thursday, German Agriculture Minister Ilse Aigner urged the European Union to label meat based on the welfare standards of its source, in an effort to increase transparency about which products come from animals raised in better conditions. The labeling system would be implemented as part of a new government program that seeks to shift German farm policy toward better animal-welfare standards and allow consumers to make informed decisions about their purchases. Officials with Deutscher Bauernverband, the German farmer’s association, argue that citizens will have to reevaluate their pricing standards and be willing to pay higher prices for humanely raised meat. Other key issues in the charter included farm animals’ designated space and freedom of movement, and the elimination of certain cruel practices such as castrating piglets without painkillers. "

Busy days, stressful jobs, and a healthy social life can make us turn to couches instead of treadmils and tortilla chips over kale salads, but the VegNews Health Challenge makes it easy to achieve our get-healthy goals with one simple change every day (example: Love yourself. So easy!). Fresh from our January+February issue, this month-long plan is all you need to reach the vibrant, high-on-life levels of health you’ve only read about. And it works, whether you start on New Year’s Day or 22 days after.  Here are just a few sneak peeks of what you’ll find in the VegNews Health Challenge: 
Day 4: Work out. Try this advice from vegan bodybuilder Robert Cheeke: “When deciding whether to exercise or not, I always think of my reasons for doing so. If I want to succeed, I know consistency and application are the only ways to get there, and therefore, my only rational response is to apply myself in ways to make success a reality.” 
Day 12: Make a mistake. In any transition, be it in your eating habits or at work, there will be screw-ups. Take it from best-selling author Kris Carr, who refuses to be labeled as a guru. “I get afraid that if I get to be the ultimate expert and the ultimate guru, that means that I can’t make any mistakes and discover.”
Day 26: Heap on whole foods. Need more motivation to kick your fast-food habit? Consumption of trans fats—typically found in processed fast food, even veg options like French Fries—have been associated with a higher risk of developing depression. Replace go-to spuds with homemade baked sweet potato fries. Download the free VegNews Health Challenge here!  "

DANGERS OF URBAN FARMING,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/dangers-of-urban-farming,"JANUARY 17, 2012","In the past few years, independent bookstores in cities such as San Francisco, Oakland, and Portland have sprouted new urban-farming sections. Sandwiched between celebrity gourmands and sustainable gardeners are newly minted books covering a range of topics relating to hobby-scale urban agriculture. Covered with colorful pastoral graphics overlaid on a gritty urban backdrop a reader can find an artsy watercolor painting of happy farm animals or images of a rooster atop a graffitied brick wall, a metropolitan rendition of American Gothic. Urban farming is a growing trend and has captured the imaginations of many people. City planning scholars, food writers, environmentalists, activists—basically anyone with a political interest in food is now likely interested in urban farming. Because of its newfound popularity in such a wide variety of intellectual disciplines, urban farming is often written about glowingly and with uncritical praise. It is often portrayed in sweeping terms as a panacea for the problems of the inner-city poor, with urban farms held in the same esteem as community centers, city parks, or public libraries. So what’s the problem? Providing access to healthful fruits and vegetables for people in low-income communities is crucial to address the inequities in the distribution of nutritious food. But in the haste to create laws to encourage farming in cities, many city governments are making one fatal mistake: deregulating animal farming. Animal Farm
Of all the community gardens and farms in cities across the country, generally less than 10 percent include animals. Some cities such as Boston, Detroit, and Washington, DC prohibit keeping animals within city limits, and others including Denver, Chicago, and Long Beach, CA prohibit the slaughtering of animals, which precludes raising animals for meat. In the past five years, the majority of cities that have deregulated animal husbandry in some way have done so because people want to have backyard chickens as “pets with benefits”—specifically, using the chickens for (urban) farm-fresh eggs. The practice of breeding, keeping, and killing other animals is an afterthought in many locations, without any real scrutiny of the larger impacts on animal welfare, human health, the environment, or city livability. If the problem we are trying to solve is food injustice, breeding animals for slaughter misses the mark. Even keeping hens for eggs is of questionable benefit. Given the costs, risks, and dangers involved in animal farming, cities should focus on creating exclusively horticulture-based urban farming systems. Out Back
What, exactly, are the risks of raising animals within city limits? The vast majority of urban farming’s shortfalls result in unnecessary suffering on the part of backyard poultry and other food animals. In his recent book, editor in chief of Make magazine Mark Frauenfelder recounts how his backyard chickens Rosie and Daisy were eaten by coyotes because the coop they were kept in was not predator proof, and later posted a recording of the neighborhood coyotes to his blog. Botched slaughter is all too common, but even slaughter that is performed “correctly” is still no treat to witness or hear happening next door. Free-roaming animals are often attracted to “livestock” enclosures, which cause conflict with human neighbors. The list of problems goes on. With so much that can go awry in backyard husbandry, communities need to evaluate what, if any, problem the practice actually solves. Sprouted Solution
Urban farming can be a positive step for people in cities who are trying to feed themselves, but if changes to city policies are not crafted with great caution they could have a large negative impact on animals. So what is the solution we should be advocating for as people who care greatly for all animals and for all people? Food Empowerment Project is doing great work to help create food systems that are just, humane, and sustainable—goals which are most effectively realized by creating food policy that is based exclusively on horticulture, leaving the controversial business of animal husbandry and slaughter aside. A 2010 study on the inequities of food distribution in California’s Santa Clara County called “Shining a Light on the Valley of Heart’s Delight” details some of the major problems that people in the inner city face with regards to accessing food that is healthful and sustainable. No one disputes the health benefits of a diet that includes copious amounts of fruits and vegetables, which can be grown on urban farms with some education and a little hard work. If our cities want to solve the very real problems of food justice and food insecurity—and not create a host of additional problems—urban horticulture should be vigorously promoted and incentivized, while animal farming and slaughter in cities should be specifically prohibited.

THE NEW RAW FOOD DIET,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/the-new-raw-food-diet,"JANUARY 16, 2012","Boutenko. Love. Sarno. Some of the biggest names in the modern raw-food movement, all one-time strident proponents of uncooked cuisine. Their daily diet consisted of kale salads, sunflower patés, date truffles, and banana ice cream—as long as it wasn’t cooked more than 118 degrees, it was fair game. But now, in the groundbreaking new book Raw & Beyond, the trio tells all on the pitfalls of the raw-food diet, why they’re all now eating cooked food, and their path to discovering the most optimal diet for human beings. Today, all three say they are experiencing the best health of their lives, so what turned them off to a 100-percent raw-food diet? Colleen talks to author and chef Victoria Boutenko to gain insight into this remarkable transformation, and how they think this book will be received by raw foodists around the world. VegNews: When did you go raw?
Victoria Boutenko: My family went raw on January 21, 1994. We decided to try the diet because we were all diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses and had lost our trust in allopathic medicine. After meeting a raw foodist and reading several books, we were excited to try this way of eating. VN: What kind of illnesses was your family dealing with?
VB: My husband had hyperthyroidism and chronic rheumatoid arthritis, I was diagnosed with arrhythmia, our daughter Valya was born with asthma and allergies, and our son Sergei had diabetes. VN: At the time, why did you think a 100-percent raw was optimal for your health?
VB: We understood that raw food was the most natural and ancient way of eating for humans. For, example, if I take two almond seeds, one raw and one roasted, they look almost the same to the eye. However, if I put these two seeds into the ground, they will behave differently. One of them will quickly rot and the other one will grow into a beautiful tree that will yield thousands of almonds every year indefinitely. From this, I concluded that the difference between those two seeds is as profound as life and death. All four of us felt better immediately after adopting an all-raw diet. VN: Since then, what flaws have you discovered in the raw diet?
VB: I found an error in my favorite statement “anything raw is superior to anything cooked.” For example, I compared the nutritional value of raw cabbage versus cooked cabbage, raw potatoes versus fried potatoes, raw walnuts versus roasted walnuts, and so on. The conclusion seemed clear to me. What I failed to think about was if there was any cooked food that had more nutritional value over any raw food. What is more nourishing: steamed asparagus or cashew nuts? Lightly cooked red cabbage or an ounce of raw almond butter? A baked apple or a slice of a raw dessert? I know now these cooked foods are nutritionally superior, but I didn’t know then to ask these questions. VN: Why are those foods—the steamed asparagus, cooked red cabbage, and baked apple—nutritionally superior? 
VB: Because in a typical raw-food diet, most calories come from oils and nuts, which we now think should be avoided. Think about one of the gourmet raw desserts, where one slice of cake can contain a cup of nuts, or all the raw burgers, pizza, and nut loafs people are eating. We understand now that regular consumption of large quantities of nuts, seeds, and oils is not healthy due to their high levels of omega 6s— which can contribute to negative health conditions including slowed metabolism, inflammation, and obesity. So in order to still get enough calories but avoid nuts, we’ve added cooked food to our diets. VN: Yes, in the book, Chad Sarno talks about how a high-oil raw diet sent his cholesterol and triglycerides through the roof, which put him at risk for heart disease. You also talk at length about omega-3s throughout the book. Tell us why you think they’re vital to good health, and the best way to get them?
VB: The latest scientific research reveals that the vast majority of us are seriously deficient in omega-3 essential fatty acids, causing thousands of preventable deaths each year. It became apparent to me that omega-3 fatty acids were essential to positive rejuvenation and healing in the body, while as raw foodists we were consuming too many omega-6s (most nuts have an extremely high omega-6 content, with almonds containing 2,000 times more omega-6s than omega-3s). Fortunately, omega-3s are widely available in all greens, especially spinach, romaine, arugula, and purslane, as well as in flax seeds, walnuts, hemp, and chia seeds. VN: What about the long-standing argument by raw foodists that animals in the wild only consume a raw diet?
VB: This was another argument I often made. However, I didn’t pay attention that they eat for at least six hours a day, which is impossible for human beings to do. VN: Knowing what you know now, what do you think is the optimal diet for great health?
VB: I consider a high-raw diet, meaning 80–95 percent raw vegan food, to be optimal for everyday life. I have stopped eating most nuts, all nut butters, and most oils, and have added cooked foods into my diet like steamed broccoli, asparagus, and cabbage. VN: So why write this book?
VB: We wanted to prevent our followers from making the same mistakes we did. VN: How did you connect with Elaina Love and Sarno to pen this book?
VB: All three of us discovered the benefits of raw eating approximately at the same time, some 17 years ago. Throughout this time, we often participated in the same events teaching people how to prepare raw foods. In 2010, our paths crossed again at at Living Light Culinary Arts Institute in Northern California. We discovered that we had all independently come to similar conclusions and are now practicing the same “beyond-raw” cuisine. We decided it was important to share our adjusted raw-food diet with our followers. VN: You used to say a 99 percent raw-food diet wasn’t good enough. What has been the response from the raw community on your new take on raw food?
VB: I was surprised to discover that most people have already arrived to the same conclusions. I did hear from some readers who blamed me for a “betrayal” of the 100-percent raw idea. I am sorry that they feel this way, but I couldn’t act in any other way, considering the new data on nuts and oils. I cannot continue encouraging my followers to consume those heavy raw desserts, and without them many people lose too much weight and become too skinny—since they do not consume adequate amount of calories for their lifestyle. I chose to add a small percent of steamed veggies instead. VN: Is a 100-percent raw-food diet ever a good idea?
VB: I think a 100-percent raw-food diet is an effective practice as a way of healing. That was extremely beneficial for my family. Now my experience and research has brought me to a high-raw diet for sustainable living. VN: How has your health changed since adopting a high-raw diet?
VB: I do not feel that anything is missing in my diet any more. I feel good and my weight is steadily normalizing. In addition I feel a profound peace inside from abandoning a place of limitation and idealism. I choose to be healthy, instead of being 100-percent raw.

HSUS GRADES OBAMA POLICIES,https://vegnews.com/2012/1/hsus-grades-obama-policies,"JANUARY 15, 2012","The Humane Society of the United States has donned a low grade of C- to the Obama administration for its efforts and policies in animal-welfare work this past year. The administration received a B in 2010 and a B- in 2009, but measures such as compromising federal protection for wolves and state laws for farm-animal welfare led to the organization lowering its score. HSUS also criticized the administration’s generous spending on lethal-predator control programs, authorization of the killing of sea lions, and capture of more than 10,000 wild horses and burros, but commends the federal government for tightening restrictions on horse transport, recommending increased funding for the more thorough implementation of federal animal-welfare laws, and refusing to import Canadian polar bear-hunting trophies.

In the second trial, the woman addressed the dogs indirectly and without eye contact before turning toward a container. By tracking the dogs’ eye movements, researchers found that the animals tended to look at the same container as the woman when they were addressed directly, suggesting that dogs, like infants, are sensitive to human communication signals.

Cromwell advises readers of Take Part, “Work your way into not consuming animals and animal products and inform yourself … This process begins your consciousness.” "

TOP 10 DETOX FOODS,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/top-10-detox-foods,"DECEMBER 30, 2011","If you’re still recovering from the overindulgences of the holiday season, there’s no better time than right now to revamp your diet and give your body a well-deserved break. Many healing, cleansing foods known for their disease-prevention properties are probably ones you already eat; those included here that you’re not consuming on a regular basis might offer inspiration the next time you’re stuck in the kitchen.

Cayenne: Enhances blood circulation, stimulates the digestive system, and protects the body with its antioxidants from the effects of harmful chemicals. Cinnamon: Helpful for reducing intestinal gas and aids in increasing blood circulation. This spice is also known to treat diarrhea, nausea, arthritis, menstrual cramps, and Candida. Garlic: Antibacterial, anticarcinogenic, and antifungal, garlic is used to treat ear infections, influenza, blood pressure, and high cholesterol. It eliminates toxins from the body and is antiparasitic. Ginger: Used to improve circulation, aid detoxification, and improve the cleansing of the kidneys and bowels. Also used to treat colds, motion sickness, nausea, and morning sickness. Miso: Helps to protect the body from radiation, cancer, air pollution, and environmental toxins. A wonderful digestive aid and protein source. Nori: This sea veggie is great paired with fried foods since it emulsifies fat and aids in its digestion. Rich in vitamin A, protein, B vitamins, calcium, and iron. Quinoa: This simple seed is a complete protein, and also boasts high calcium and lysine contents. Turmeric: Found in most curry powders, this mustard-colored spice is high in beta carotene, strengthens the immune system, and helps to dissolve cysts and tumors. Winter Squash: A warming food, these sweet squashes are a good source of vitamins A, C, and potassium. "

5 MUST-READ VEGAN FITNESS TIPS,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/5-must-read-vegan-fitness-tips,"DECEMBER 29, 2011","We all know it’s important to stay in shape, but as January 1 becomes a distant memory, distractions arise. Going back to school, the new television season, cupcakes—you know the usual list of saboteurs. Add on the fact that cold weather is ever-present, making it more difficult to stick to your fitness goals. So what’s the best way to stay motivated? Veg fitness guru and VN writer Christine Vardaros offers up a five-step strategy to staying toned, trim, and off the couch in the new year. Step 1: Target your goal and tell the world
Setting a goal is always the first step to success, and a great way to commit to exercise is to choose a challenging and exciting sporting event to train for. The event—whether it’s a walkathon, 5K run, softball game, or triathlon—should be scheduled a few months down the road to give you time to prepare, and it should require registration to ensure your commitment. Next, tell everyone about your plans. Who knows, some of your friends might decide to join you! Step 2: You are what you eat
Make sure your diet provides adequate nutrition to enhance your performance and support optimal recovery. Contrary to popular belief, muscle size doesn’t depend so much on protein intake as it does on your training and genetics. Too much protein can actually hinder your fitness efforts because it is tough to digest. Carbohydrates are the optimal nutrient for active bodies, especially if you want increased endurance during exercise. Ideally, carbs should make up 55 to 70 percent of your total caloric intake. Make sure you incorporate carbs into your pre-event breakfast to keep energy levels up. Step 3: Slow and steady wins the race
When you start training, pace yourself and gradually increase the intensity. If your goal is a 5K run, start by going for short walks, and then start to incorporate short runs. Keep building until your body is ready to handle the distance and intensity you plan to conquer. Even though you may be eager in the beginning, a conservative approach will prevent injury, keep you mentally and physically fresh, and give your body time to recover and adapt. Step Four: Amp up the H2O
Make sure you are hydrated before, during, and after your workout. Start sipping water the minute you wake up on the day of your event. About 40 ounces—the equivalent of two sports bottles—is optimal before an event, and you should keep drinking until an hour before it begins. During the event you’ll want to drink between 20 and 40 ounces of liquid and eat between 200 to 350 calories per hour to keep your energy high, even if you don’t feel hungry or thirsty. Step Five: Congratulate yourself and stay motivated!
You set a goal, created a plan, stuck to your strategy and worked hard for your success. Now, give yourself a well-deserved pat on the back! But don’t stop there. Make a commitment to continue your training routine, and if you need extra motivation, you can always find another event, sport, or workout buddy. Now go ahead and indulge in your favorite vegan dessert. You earned it! "
PREVENTING AGING WITH VEGAN FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/preventing-aging-with-vegan-food-1-1,"DECEMBER 29, 2011","While we have yet to crack the code to the fountain of youth, there are some sneaky ways to ensure you’ll get carded a little longer than your omni friends. As PETA’s sexiest vegetarian over 50 Mimi Kirk proves, 70 really can be the new 20. Here’s how to maximize the anti-aging benefits inherent in vegan foodstuffs. Vitamin C
Nothing gives away your age more than wrinkles—or a bad botox job. But instead of using expensive creams that work from the outside, try something that works from within. Vitamin C supports the synthesis of collagen, the structural protein in our tissues that makes up 75 to 80 percent of skin, and collagen breakdown is responsible for the wrinkles that seem inevitable. With vitamin C abundant in countless plant foods from cabbage and potatoes to citrus and pomegranate, some hypothesize that diets packing seven to nine servings per day of fresh produce may help skin retain its elasticity. Taste the Rainbow
Antioxidants prevent the formation of free radicals, which are unstable particles produced in the body that can damage cells and lead to a whole host of health problems. Without antioxidants, these harmful particles accumulate over time. If you want to avoid this, just think color! Blueberries’ rich hue reveals they are full of flavanoids that fight free radicals. Bright orange carrots and sweet potatoes have high levels of beta-carotene, which is known to promote healthy skin, eyes, and cardio health. Ruby red tomatoes have lots of lycopene, a compound that protects the arteries. Got Calcium?
Bone loss becomes a major concern as the years progress. It is important for bones to stay strong so you can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and stay fit. What squashes an active lifestyle more than a broken hip? Calcium is an important mineral for bone health, and one great plant source is kale, which has more calcium per gram than cow’s milk. And don’t forget to up your vitamin D intake to help calcium absorption—15 minutes per day of sun exposure should be sufficient. Stay Svelte
Maintaining a youthful figure is harder at 60 than it is at 16, because metabolism slows down with age. So pick foods that are full of nutrients but light on calories. Another way to stave off the pounds is to increase your fiber intake, because it keeps you fuller for longer. Luckily, fiber is available everywhere in whole fruits, vegetables, and grains. Try to incorporate beans into your meals for some soluble fiber that promotes digestive health. Don’t Fear the Fats
Fats derived from animal sources can speed up aging and add to health problems, but plant-based fats offer a great deal of benefits. Walnuts are loaded with alpha-linoleic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid that keeps your heart and brain functioning optimally. Avocados contain oleic acid, which works to improve cholesterol levels. This good-fat-filled fruit also has potassium and folate, which lower the risk of heart attack and stroke. While genetics play an important role, when it comes to aging, you are what you eat. "
STUDY: RATS EXHIBIT EMPATHY,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/study-rats-exhibit-empathy,"DECEMBER 28, 2011","A new study published in Science magazine has found that rats display behaviors of empathy and will even choose to help other rats over receiving food rewards. Conducted at the University of Chicago, the experiment found that when untrained rats were presented with the option of freeing a trapped cage-mate by opening a door or indulging in chocolate behind another door, the rats chose to help their cage-mate. When given both options simultaneously, rats would free their cage-mates and then share the chocolate together. In a discussion on the study from The Huffington Post, writer Marc Bekoff comments, “The desperation of science to rob animals of their sentience produces distortions that open the door for egregious and reprehensible abuse.” "
BE VEG CAMPAIGN BROADENS,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/be-veg-campaign-broadens,"DECEMBER 27, 2011","Organizers behind the “Be Veg” Toronto Subway Ad Campaign report that a series of ads asking viewers, “Why love one but eat the other?” featuring companion animals alongside cows and baby chicks has raised awareness in the area. Lisa Kramer and Kimberly Carroll launched 1,000 ads in the Toronto subway system starting in October and have inspired many area residents to go veg as a result of the campaign. Carroll and Kramer originally conceived of the idea in 2009 and started the campaign on a smaller scale with support from Mercy for Animals, which started a similar campaign in the United States. Presently, Carroll states that other countries such as New Zealand, France, Taiwan, and the UK are considering running the same advertising in transit systems. A companion video to ads has garnered more than 35,000 views since launching in December. "

2011’S TOP 10 VEGAN TRENDS,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/2011s-top-10-vegan-trends,"DECEMBER 19, 2011","1. Chains Add Vegan Options
This year, mainstream restaurant chains across the country hopped on the vegan bandwagon, making it easier than ever to dine cruelty-free. Just a few months after adding vegan Bistro Box meals to its line of café foods, Starbucks announced that it had acquired juice company Evolution Fresh, with plans to open retail locations focused on juice and health food in 2012. More than 100 7-Eleven stores began carrying new vegan meals such as Pad Thai and Linguine Tikka Masala after a test run in New York received rave reviews. And in October, Subway reached out to its vegan customers for feedback on its veg menu options before adding a vegan patty to its menu at several Canadian outlets of the more than 34,000-location chain. 2. Celebrities Go Vegan
Whether moved by a compelling documentary or inspired by a groundbreaking book, it was a banner year for ditching meat and dairy among the famous and infamous. Celebrities who abandoned their omnivorous ways in 2011 included country music darling Carrie Underwood, Lost actor Jorge Garcia, actress Eliza Dushku, godfather of heavy metal Ozzy Osbourne, and actor-comedian Russell Brand. Former President Bill Clinton opted for a plant-based diet to cure his ailing heart, while Oprah brought veganism to daytime television by spending a week as a vegan with nearly 400 of her employees. And just last month, vegan power couple Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi announced plans to open a new vegan restaurant in Los Angeles.  3. Shark Finning Banned
2011 marks a year chockfull of added protections for sharks, who are often thrown back into the ocean, still alive, after their fins have been cut off for human use. Taiwan made history as the first Asian nation to ban shark finning, following the Pacific island of Guam. On the homefront, President Obama signed a law to toughen an 11-year-old ban on the practice in January. California, Washington, and Oregon all approved legislation to end the sale, trade, and possession of fins, most to take effect in 2012 and 2013. Finally, The Food Network joined the upsurge to protect sharks—it agreed to discontinue the use of shark fin as an ingredient in its recipes after tens of thousands of viewers signed an online petition. 4. Food Trucks Take Off
Vegan chefs have hit the road across the US in what can only be described as a food truck explosion. Hit television series The Great Food Truck Race helped vegan contestant Seabirds Truck claim national fame for its meals on wheels. New Jersey’s The Cinnamon Snail expanded service of its organic vegan doughnuts and raw pizza into New York City in December. Other vegan food trucks that opened this year include macaroni-and-cheese specialist Mac’n Food Truck in Miami, Loving Hut Express in Vancouver, Dallas-based Jackalope Mobile Kitchen, and Denver’s Vegan Van, among dozens of others. 5. Nonprofits Strengthen
Animal organizations made huge strides in bettering the lives of all creatures this year. Mercy For Animals, VegNews’ 2011 Nonprofit of the Year, influenced major businesses like Target, McDonald’s, Costco, Kroger, and Safeway to drop cruel suppliers after releasing footage depicting inhumane treatment of hens and pigs at suppliers’ farms. Farm Sanctuary celebrated 25 years with cross-country anniversary events and hosted the first-ever National Conference to End Factory Farming in October. DC-based Compassion Over Killing made strides by uncovering a $9.5 billion price-fixing scheme in the dairy industry, expanding its VegWeek campaign, and working with meat-alternative producer Quorn to develop its first vegan product. 6. Vegan Cookbooks Explode
For culinary amateurs and seasoned chefs alike, 2011 brought more vegan cookbooks to bookstore shelves than ever before. The much anticipated release of The Candle 79 Cookbook had many drooling over recipes like Saffron Ravioli, Ginger-Seitan Dumplings, and Mexican Chocolate Cake. VegNews celebrated the release of Spork-Fed, the first book from LA-based sisters Jenny Engel and Heather Goldberg, with a glamorous evening bash in San Francisco. Robin Robertson’s Quick-Fix Vegan taught us how to make appetizing vegan meals in less than 30 minutes, and Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero’s Vegan Pie in the Sky gives delicious details on overhauling the all-American classic dessert. And with The Healthy Voyager’s Global Kitchen set for publication on January 1, we know 2012 will no doubt rival this year’s cookbook trend. 7. Dairy Substitutions on the Rise
In January, The Wall Street Journal reported that the alternative-milk industry, fueled by almond milk from Silk and Blue Diamond Growers, grew by 13 percent in 2010. Today, shoppers can find grocery-store shelves packed with milk substitutes ranging from hemp and cashew to coconut and oat. Clearly, the dairy industry has taken notice that competition is on the rise—Got Milk?’s current ad campaign challenges viewers to “find the real milk” while criticizing non-dairy milk alternatives. This year also brought more options such as coconut milk nog, almond-based yogurt, macadamia–based cheese, and cashew-milk ice cream. 8. School Lunches Revamped
With the demise of the food pyramid in favor of the new MyPlate nutrition campaign, school lunches across the US received a makeover this year, and the benefits are being felt across the country. Students at South Carolina’s Greenville County schools were in for a treat after their district teamed up with a local culinary institute to train cafeteria workers on the preparation of vegetarian and raw lunches. In Salt Lake City, the Granite School District adopted Meatless Mondays for a month-long trial run in October, with the possibility of continuing the program in 2012. Even colleges have caught on—the University of North Texas in Denton revamped one cafeteria into a completely vegan dining hall just in time for the fall 2011 semester. 9. Mainstream Media Goes Veg
While Oprah’s vegan week brought the cruelty-free lifestyle to daytime TV, she wasn’t the only small-screen star to broach the subject. Martha Stewart devoted an episode of her show to veganism in March with guests Biz Stone and Kathy Freston, while CNN aired an hour-long special on Clinton’s journey to a plant-based diet. In print and web media, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Glamour, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, and National Public Radio all published vegan-related stories this year. And for the holidays, VegNews was just one of many places to turn to for vegan recipes—mainstream publications like Sunset, The New York Times, Shape, The Wall Street Journal, Women’s Health, Whole Living, Bon Appetit, and Every Day with Rachael Ray all published seasonal veg-friendly recipes. In short, veganism has never received so much ink and airtime in one year. 10. Vegan Films Hit Silver Screen
2011 was a remarkable time for vegan films hitting big screens across the country. VN’s Movie of the Year, Forks Over Knives, impressed audiences at sold-out screenings nationwide with its scientific evidence and inspiring stories, influencing many to jump on the vegan bandwagon. With Vegucated’s compelling storyline of three meat-and-cheese-loving New Yorkers experimenting with veganism for six weeks, it’s no wonder it took home myriad awards during its cross-country film festival tour. Planteat documented the lives of three men as they searched for a diet that improves the health of people and the planet, while Got The Facts on Milk? gave the inside scoop on what’s really behind the frothy white stuff. These eye-opening films captured the attention of film critics and continue to influence viewers—heck, even Ozzy Osbourne changed his diet after watching Forks Over Knives.

Ten famous faces—including actors Ryan Gosling, Zooey Deschanel, Alicia Silverstone, and singer Bryan Adams—issued the appeal yesterday in response to a recent undercover investigation by Mercy For Animals that revealed cruel and deplorable conditions at the facilities of Sparboe Farms, one of McDonald’s biggest suppliers. “On behalf of compassionate people everywhere,” the letter states, “I implore you to help end the needless suffering of these animals by adopting strict and meaningful animal-welfare policies worldwide, including the commitment to prohibit the purchase of eggs produced by hens who spend their miserable lives crammed into tiny wire cages.” McDonald’s discontinued the use of eggs from Sparboe following MFA’s investigation.

VEG DIET HELPS KIDNEY HEALTH,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/veg-diet-helps-kidney-health,"DECEMBER 19, 2011","Recent research has found that a vegetarian diet can help people with kidney disease prevent dangerous levels of phosphorous from accumulating in their bodies. A study conducted by Sharon Moe, MD and her colleagues at the Indiana University School of Medicine and published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology assigned patients a vegetarian or meat-based diet for one week, and then switched the diets two to four weeks later. At the end of each week, patients on the vegetarian diet were found to have lower blood phosphorus levels and decreased levels of phosphorous in their urine, despite equal amounts of protein and phosphorus concentrations in both of the diets. Researchers concluded that the source of dietary protein has a significant effect on the accumulation of phosphorous for patients with chronic kidney disease. "

EGG INDUSTRY LAWSUIT,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/egg-industry-lawsuit,"DECEMBER 18, 2011","Last week, a group of major food companies filed a federal antitrust complaint against United Egg Producers, United States Egg Marketers, and 11 other egg farms and distributors, claiming that the groups conspired to control egg prices by tampering with supply to increase demand. The plaintiffs, which include Kraft Foods, Kellogg, General Mills, and Nestle, allege that the egg groups profited from reducing their supply to raise prices through means such as destroying hens and chicks. The complaint also claims that almost 2,000 small egg farms went out of business as a result of the conspiracy. The food companies are hoping to receive monetary damages for violations of antitrust and fraudulent concealment laws, as well as a ruling to bar the producers from manipulating prices in the future. "

10 BEST VEGAN BOOKS OF 2011,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/10-best-vegan-books-of-2011,"DECEMBER 18, 2011","Whether you still prefer flipping pages of paper, or finger scrolling is your choice delivery system, 2011 was a literary feast for the eyes and cerebral cortex, delivering a banner crop of reads ranging from pseudo-memoirs to women empowerment, plus a couple of vegan treatises, a pair of beautiful picture books, and a scathing censure of bovine secretions. Veganism hit a new high-water mark this year, with much more media attention than ever in mainstream magazines, widely distributed documentaries, ample vegan contestants on TV cooking shows, and myriad celebs eschewing the chewing. The following books were part of this marvelous maelstrom, benefiting from the newfound attention and augmenting the evidence that a plant-based diet, along with compassion and kindness, is our future. The Bond: Our Kinship with Animals, Our Call to Defend Them by Wayne Pacelle (William Morrow)
HSUS head Pacelle replays his 20+ years of animal advocacy through stories of actions and campaigns he has been involved with and in. Part bio, part historical, and with a keen eye toward the future, The Bond entertainingly bridges recent progress with attainable successes clearly on the horizon. Change of Heart: What Psychology Can Teach Us About Spreading Social Change by Nick Cooney (Lantern Books)
However you feel about the Occupy movement, one thing the 99-percenters would benefit from is required reading of Nick Cooney’s Change of Heart, a handbook for social change. Cooney transmogrified himself from loud, in-your-face activist to short-haired, suit-and-(sometimes)-tie director of The Humane League, and his effectiveness multiplied exponentially. Heart shows how it can work for you, too. The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Plant-Based Nutrition by Julieanna Hever, RD (Alpha Books)
The first of two books by dietitians to make this list, VN’s “Plant-Based Dietitian” columnist Hever’s effort is the perfect Rx for those new to a diet sans animal products. Plant-Based covers all the bases, a reference that you will joyfully turn to again and again while you transition toward a healthful, nutritious diet. The Exultant Ark: A Pictorial Tour of Animal Pleasure by Jonathan Balcombe (University of California Press)
Ark is a museum exhibit waiting to happen. More than 130 visually and emotionally beautiful full-color photographs of non-humans, from the African elephant to the zebra shark, combined with the insightful and poignant prose of Balcombe, an ethologist who has few peers. This book will lift your spirits. Green is the New Red: An Insider’s Account of a Social Movement Under Siege by Will Potter (City Light Publishers)
Journalist Potter chronicles the US Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, both the law and its implications, through sad-but-true accounts of animal- and eco-activists who have been prosecuted by the over-reaching and questionably Constitutional legislation. Drawing parallels to Joseph McCarthy’s “red scare” of the 1950s, Green reads like a spy-thriller but is, unfortunately, non-fiction. Ninety-Five: Meeting America’s Farmed Animals in Stories and Photographs (No Voice Unheard)
Much like The Exultant Ark, Ninety-Five matches heart-melting photos with heart-warming prose, in this case former farmed animals now living the life of sanctuary. Each animal has a name, and a story, and it just doesn’t get any better. You will find yourself leafing through Ninety-Five often, sharing each vignette with everyone you know. Think: Straight Talk for Women to Stay Smart in a Dumbed-Down World by Lisa Bloom (Vanguard Press)
Think makes the list due to its vegan author. While the subject isn’t about veganism, it’s still timely, important, and worthy. All women—and men—would benefit greatly by investing a few hours with Bloom and “reclaiming the brain that God gave you.” Vegan for Life: Everything You Need to Know to be Healthy and Fit on a Plant-Based Diet by Jack Norris, RD and Virginia Messina, RD (Da Capo/Lifelong Books)
You’ve been vegan awhile and want to be even healthier. Or that French fries and cola diet is no longer working, now that you have entered your 30s. Take two dietitians and call me in the morning. Vegan for Life is a book you will keep for life, and if you follow the advice of RDs Norris and Messina, chances are it will be a long one. Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, and Change the World by Kathy Freston (Weinstein Books)
Easily the most influential vegan book of the year, Veganist, which encourages progress over perfection, climbed to #2 on the New York Times best-seller list in February. Veganist focuses not on defining what a person is or isn’t, but rather as one who practices or studies the subject of a cruelty-free lifestyle. Kinda like Bill Clinton. Whitewash: The Disturbing Truth About Cow’s Milk and Your Health by Joseph Keon (New Society Publishers)
John Robbins makes it succinct: “The best book yet written on the subject.” Whitewash, VegNews’ Book of the Year for 2011, fuses science with rational discourse, which results in the indisputable truth about cow juice. It’s worse than you thought. Keon’s research is impeccable; if this book doesn’t get you off dairy, nothing will. Be sure to check out our other top trends and books of 2011!

2011’s Top 10 Vegan Trends "
RUSSELL SIMMONS AWARDED,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/russell-simmons-awarded,"DECEMBER 18, 2011","Animal-rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has just named Russell Simmons, the co-founder of Def Jam Records, Person of the Year. Simmons adopted veganism more than a decade ago and has since worked to better the lives of animals by discussing his cruelty-free lifestyle in the mainstream media and developing a vegan-friendly clothing line. PETA honored Simmons earlier this month by printing his portrait on its limited-edition postage stamps. Simmons tells PETA, “I’m truly humbled to be chosen as this year’s Person of the Year, but the praise should go to the hundreds of thousands of volunteers that are on the ground doing the work.” "
ROCKERS OPEN NY VEG SPOT,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/rockers-open-ny-veg-spot,"DECEMBER 17, 2011","On Friday, Long Island Vegetarian Eatery opened its doors for business in the town of Seaford. The casual restaurant was founded by Eric Finneran and Salvatore Mignano, who were inspired to open a late night veg eatery after being frustrated by the void of options for cruelty-free dining after 10pm. LIVE, which will stay open until 3am Thursday through Sunday, features a completely vegetarian and mostly vegan menu that includes vegan jalapeño poppers, pulled-“pork” sliders, and deep-fried Oreos. Finneran, who also owns the music-space Cellar Door Studio, tells Long Island Report that the new eatery “cater[s] primarily to kids in rock bands or kids who like rock music.” "

ACTIVISTS VS. PROTEST LAW,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/activists-vs-protest-law,"DECEMBER 15, 2011","Yesterday, five animal-rights activists represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing that the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act is unconstitutional and should be repealed. The AETA classifies any actions that result in a loss of profits for businesses that use or sell animal products, such as fur protests or undercover investigations, to be treated as terrorism. Although the law is enforced infrequently, the plaintiffs argue that it has led many activists to avoid legal protest out of fear of prosecution. Staff attorney Rachel Meeropol tells The Washington Post that the law prohibits protests that are protected by the First Amendment. "
AUSTIN’S VEGAN ICE CREAM PARLOR,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/austins-vegan-ice-cream-parlor,"DECEMBER 15, 2011","This month, vegan ice cream parlor Sweet Ritual opened for business in Austin, TX, serving a combination of soy- and coconut milk-based frozen treats. Co-owners Amelia Raley and Valerie Ward conceptualized the shop after Raley began serving vegan soft-serve at Toy Joy—a local combination toy store and café—several years ago, and the duo decided to start a business featuring ice cream parlor recipes from the early 1900s. The parlor, which received more than $3,000 in donations through Kickstarter, will include touches like a 1950s milkshake spindle machine, homemade waffle cones, and antique furniture. The pair tells Austin Culture Map that they have been experimenting with ice cream flavors like lemon-poppyseed, bananas foster, and chocolate-lavender. Photo: Garrison MacArthur Photographers "
ANATOMY OF A VEGAN INFOGRAPH,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/anatomy-of-a-vegan-infograph,"DECEMBER 15, 2011","Physical therapy group Advanced Physical Medicine has just released an infographic entitled “Anatomy of a Vegan.” The image uses data from the Vegetarian Resource Group and an October survey conducted on Facebook. Key statistics gathered from 144 respondents included are demographics of vegans, how much they spend on groceries, and what types of stores they frequent. The infographic also shows that 93 percent of respondents considered the rights and welfare of animals as either an “important” or a “very important” reason they decided to ditch meat and dairy. "
FARM’S NEW VAN & VIDEO TOUR,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/farms-new-van-andamp-video-tour,"DECEMBER 14, 2011","Vegan-advocacy organization Farm Animal Rights Movement has just revealed designs for its new van, which will take the organization’s Pay-Per-View video campaign on the road. FARM’s video campaign pays participants $1 each to watch Mercy For Animals’ Farm to Fridge video on the cruel treatment of farm animals—a tactic that, according to a FARM survey, has convinced more than 50 percent of viewers to reduce their consumption of animals. Featuring eight video monitors and 32 pairs of headphones, the vehicle will allow FARM to reach more than 100,000 people annually by stopping at roughly 300 events, starting with The Vans Warped Tour in June 2012. FARM is currently working with a manufacturer to finalize the designs and is seeking donations to complete the project. Image courtesy of FARM "
STATES RANKED IN ANIMAL WELFARE,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/states-ranked-in-animal-welfare,"DECEMBER 14, 2011","The Animal Legal Defense Fund has released its sixth annual US Animal Protection Laws Rankings, analyzing animal-welfare laws across the country and grading each state according to how its animals—and animal abusers—fare legally. The year’s five top-rated states are Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Oregon, and California. Conversely, Kentucky, North Dakota, Idaho, Iowa, and South Dakota scored the lowest regarding penalties for animal cruelty. The ALDF ranked the states based on numeric scores accumulated from 41 questions spanning 14 different animal-protection law categories. The full report discloses both existing strengths and potential improvements for each of the winners, as well as a thorough examination of the legal shortcomings of the lowest-ranked states. "
GREENS IMPACT IMMUNE SYSTEM,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/greens-impact-immune-system,"DECEMBER 14, 2011","A recent study published in the journal Cell has found a natural way to fight disease: Eat your greens. According to UK scientists, green vegetables are vital to a responsive immune system and healthy intestinal tract. The researchers found that mice who consumed a purified diet of essential nutrients, minerals, and vitamins, but little to no vegetables, lost 70 percent of a specialized white blood cell in their intestinal tracts in a two to three week span, increasing their risk of infection and inflammation. The United States Department of Agriculture recommends that adults consume between two and three cups of vegetables daily. "

DOUBLE YOUR GIFT WITH ONE-FOR-ONE PROGRAMS,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/double-your-gift-with-one-for-one-programs,"DECEMBER 13, 2011","Love holiday shopping but rue the consumerist guilt that comes along with it? With the wide array of one-for-one programs currently available through a variety of generous companies, you can give back while giving to friends and family. Each time you buy a product from one of these companies, a person in need receives a donation. Whether providing sturdy shoes to underprivileged children, glasses to the vision-impaired, comforters to the homeless, or even prophylactics to areas without access to health services, these products will create two smiles thousands of miles apart. A Mile In My Shoes
One of the best-known one-for-one programs is TOMS—the company that brought the charitable movement to the mainstream. TOMS has provided more than one million pairs of shoes to children around the world through the sales of their popular slip-ons, which come in more than 20 vegan styles. And they’re not the only footwear that betters the planet. For each pair of its sandals that are sold, Freewaters provides one person in need with access to clean drinking water for an entire year, and most of their styles are cruelty-free. Hybrid company-nonprofit Roma gives back by combining business with charity—the footwear brand sells high-quality, natural rubber-and-cotton rain boots in the US, but also has a nonprofit sector called Roma for All that provides impoverished children in cold, wet climates with their own pair of the protective kicks. Keeping a cute kid safe from hypothermia and pneumonia? Sounds like a way better gift than a tie or a toaster.  Sight for More Eyes
For those of us without the luxury of 20/20, being able to see clearly requires a trip to the optometrist, a prescription, and a pricey pair of specs or contacts. The World Health Organization estimates that 285 million people worldwide are visually impaired, and experience greater difficulty learning and working because of their compromised eyesight. Several one-for-one programs work to provide glasses to areas and populations where they are unavailable. Vintage-inspired eyewear brand Warby Parker has distributed more than 85,000 pairs of glasses to people in more than 36 countries through social enterprises, eye clinics, and nonprofits. According to the company, glasses have the ability to increase one’s income by 20 percent, giving people who would otherwise be out of work the ability to see clearly and contribute to society. TOMS has also started a one-for-one eyewear intitiative, with the purchase of one pair of TOMS sunglasses providing medical treatment, prescription glasses, or optical surgery for someone in need. Styles are available for both ladies and gentlemen, and currently, donations are provided to Nepal, Cambodia, and Tibet, focusing on women (who comprise two-thirds of the world’s blind). Portland-based glasses company 141 is named for its mission—one pair of glasses for you means one pair of prescription glasses for a disadvantaged person elsewhere. Oh, and did we mention that their glasses—which come in styles like the Clark Kent-esque “Belmont” and faux-tortoiseshell “Flanders”—are super chic? Activist Accessories
Got a minute to save the planet? Next time you need to check the time, consider doing it on a WeWOOD watch, made from all-natural, eco-friendly, non-toxic materials—and sans leather wristband. For every watch purchased, the company plants a tree through nonprofit conservation organization American Forests, which has a goal of planting 100 million trees by 2020. Or, give someone the pack off your back, almost literally—Ark Collective provides a backpack to one of the 14 million students living below the poverty line for each bag sold. Better yet, the bags are both practical and sustainable, with a durable natural canvas body, padded straps, a laptop sleeve, and extra pockets. Wondering what you should keep in your conscientious carrier? How about a few of Sir Richard’s Condoms, which are not only vegan, but also philanthropic—for every condom purchased, another is donated to a developing country, helping to ensure safe sex one duo at a time. They recently unveiled a new monthly subscription service so that customers can get busy without having to make an untimely last-minute trip to the store. And while you’re thinking between the sheets, consider buying a down alternative comforter from The Company Store, which donates a comforter to a homeless child every time one is sold. With more than 1.5 million children in the US impacted by homelessness, there’s no better time than the holidays to consider those who don’t have a cozy fireplace to nestle by. Forget the department-store frenzy this year and consider giving a gift that gives back to someone in need. One-for-one programs mean that two happy recipients will experience the holiday spirit for the price of one present, and the warm fuzzies you’ll get are completely free. "

10 BEST VEGAN COOKBOOKS OF 2011,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/10-best-vegan-cookbooks-of-2011,"DECEMBER 12, 2011","Imagine having a job where people send you cookbooks for free! I do. Once upon a time, in the annals of my family lore, it was said that I couldn’t boil water (actually, I boiled it very well, until the pot went dry and burned. Blackened H20, thank you very much). But that was then. Today, I could be a master chef if I so chose, but then no one would send me books, and I wouldn’t get to pick my favorite 10 of ‘11. So let’s just keep things the way they are—I now present Your 10 Must-Have Vegan Cookbooks of 2011. Ani’s Raw Food Asia: Easy East-West Fusion Recipes by Ani Phyo (Da Capo/Lifelong Books)
The raw-foods superstar cruises the Pacific with recipes from China, Hawaii, India, Indonesia, Japan, (her ancestral) Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam in a colorful and photo-heavy book that will surely add plenty of healthy phytochemicals to your breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Big Vegan: More Than 350 Recipes, No Meat/No Dairy, All Delicious by Robin Asbell (Chronicle Books)
If you had any doubts about the growth of veganism, pick up this book… if you can. Gorgeous, inviting, and amazingly well thought out, Big Vegan is a resource you’ll be cooking from for years to come. It will also come in handy as a step stool when you need to fetch that rarely needed ingredient from the top shelf. Candle 79: Modern Vegan Classics from New York’s Premier Sustainable Restaurant by Joy Pierson, Angel Ramos, & Jorge Pineda (Ten Speed Press)
This one only made this list because it was named VegNews’ 2011 Cookbook of the Year. Only kidding! A beautiful, sleek, elegant hardcover with stunning color photography, Candle 79 elevates the world of vegan cookbooks in much the same way that its namesake restaurant did for vegan cuisine. Now where’s my Seitan Piccata? Hearty Vegan Meals for Monster Appetites by Celine Steen and Joni Marie Newman (Fair Winds Press)
Oh. My. God. True story: The VN staff was so glassy-eyed when this book arrived in the office that they scheduled a Sunday brunch at Online Editor Anna’s house for which all recipes were lifted from Hearty. Everything was delicious, even the non-vegans gobbled up the goodies, and we had to shutter VegNews the next day. OK, that last part isn’t true. Raw Food For Everyone: Essential Techniques and 300 Simple-to-Sophisticated Recipes by Alissa Cohen and Leah J. Dubois (Avery Trade)
The scope of Raw Food garners it a mention on this list, though the recipes might have a little something to do with it, too. Anyone who has been intimidated by uncooking would do well to add this one to their pantry, and reap the health benefits along with the Sweet Potato Chips (they’re dehydrated). Spork Fed: Super Fun and Flavorful Recipes from the Sisters of Spork Foods by Jenny Engel & Heather Goldberg (St. Lynn’s Press)
Take two adorably positive (and positively adorable) sisters, add a splash of media savvy, throw in successful, sold-out Hollywood cooking classes, and you have veganism for the 2010s! First-time authors Engel & Goldberg effortlessly translate their style and sass into Spork Fed, which is perfect for fans who can’t travel to LA for lessons. Sweet Vegan: A Collection of All Vegan, Some Gluten-Free, and A Few Raw Desserts by Emily Mainquist (Kyle Books)
The first book from the owner of Baltimore, MD’s Emily’s Desserts is a classy, classic keeper. Stylish, sophisticated, and indulgent, Sweet Vegan will have you longing for the sequel. Plus, a portion of its sales are donated to Farm Sanctuary. Sweet! The Vegan Cookie Connoisseur: Over 140 Delectable Recipes to Treat the Eyes and Taste Buds by Kelly Peloza (Skyhorse Publishing)
Disclaimer: You’ll gain 10 pounds just leafing through this book—the pages look that good. Another hardcover with mouth-watering photography, make sure to hide this one behind the sofa cushion when you go on that cleanse. First one to send me a dozen Oatmeal Cream Pies wins a prize. Vegan Desserts: Sumptuous Sweets for Every Season by Hannah Kaminsky (Skyhorse Publishing)
Have no fear: even if the author wasn’t a VN contributor, this one would make the list. The second book by the prodigy of vegan sweets, Vegan Desserts doesn’t suffer from a sophomore slump in the least. Combined with the author’s expert photography (oh, to be so young and so talented), why is it again you haven’t yet picked up a copy? Vegan Diner: Classic Comfort Food for the Body & Soul by Julie Hasson (Running Press)
How much fun is Vegan Diner? Let’s just say that you won’t find this one in Joel Fuhrman’s kitchen. Can you say burgers and shakes and fries, oh my? Hasson’s book takes the animal products out of the greasy spoon, but leaves you wanting for nothing. Vegan Family Meals: Real Food for Everyone by Ann Gentry (Andrews McMeel Publishing)
That author Ann Gentry also happens to be the founder of Los Angeles’ Real Food Daily restaurant means that the next time you are in SoCal you can ask, “Is the recipe for Harvest Kale Salad with Sweet Mustard Tempeh and Saffron-Orange Tahini Dressing on the menu yet?” This one is a classic. Dig in. OK, so that’s 11. And there were plenty more worthy efforts. Why don’t we make it an even  dozen: Leave a comment about your fave cookbook of 2011 that doesn’t appear above. And stay tuned—next week I’ll reveal my Top 10 (or 12) non-fiction books of the year. Be sure to check out our other top trends and books of 2011!

DANGERS OF FARM ANTIBIOTIC USE,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/dangers-of-farm-antibiotic-use,"DECEMBER 11, 2011","Farm animals nationwide are pumped full of non-therapeutic antibiotics in order to reduce disease in the crowded and unsanitary conditions of factory farms, and consequences are starting to surface within the US health-care system. A new study from researchers at Tufts University recently published in Critical Microbiology Reviews shows evidence that antibiotics from farm animals have entered food, water, and air supplies and led to increased incidences of drug-resistant infections in human populations. A separate study from earlier this year found that 77 percent of turkey samples from US grocery stores tested positive for the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, (known colloquially as Staph), and roughly 96 percent of the affected samples were resistant to at least one antimicrobial medicine.

SKATER LAUNCHES VEG WEBSITE,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/skater-launches-veg-website,"DECEMBER 11, 2011","After finding that a vegan diet dramatically improved her health, former competitive figure skater Rebecca Gilbert of Pittsburgh, PA, has launched a new online community focused on plant-based living. Titled Yummy Plants, the website features cruelty-free recipes, a database of vegan-friendly restaurants, nutritional information, user forms, and even an “Experts Corner” with interviews of esteemed plant-based health experts like Neal Barnard, MD and Joel Fuhrman, MD. The website also caters to special dietary requirements by including yeast-free and gluten-free recipes. In her bio on the website, Gilbert says that she was inspired to create Yummy Plants after her chronic joint pain disappeared following her switch to a plant-based diet. "
HICKORY-SMOKED VEGAN CHEDDAR,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/hickory-smoked-vegan-cheddar,"DECEMBER 11, 2011","I henceforth dub this era Vegan Cheese: The Next Generation. These incarnations of dairy-free delights are so creamy, flavorful, and versatile that they put the milk-made stuff to shame. When we first feasted on WayFare’s We Can’t Say It’s Cheese in Hickory Cheddar, we could hardly believe our taste buds. While we considered keeping this amazing savory spread all to ourselves, our sense of heroic duty called, necessitating that we share the wealth. We’re picturing this cheery cheese melted on nachos, dolloped on chili, or just chowed on some crackers or chips, but the sky is really the limit. This vegan cheese might be boldly going where no cheese has gone before—into the furthermost galaxies of dairy-free deliciousness. We can’t wait to see what else is out there. "
NEW VEGAN SUPPER CLUB,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/new-vegan-supper-club,"DECEMBER 11, 2011","Vancouver animal-rights activists Carissa Thorpe and Tara-Lee Gardner have started a new venture called Harmless Innovations, which they plan to use as a means of activating their local community through a secret vegan supper club as well as bake sales and catering. The duo plan to launch the first installment of the supper club on January 7 with an appetizer night and follow with themes, such as a diner night or special Valentine’s Day edition, and hope that their creative events will help to raise awareness of the benefits of a vegan lifestyle. Thorpe tells Vancouver online news source Straight, “ … What we’re looking to do is have a vegan presence in places that aren’t necessarily vegan.” "
VEGAN KICKSTARTER SUCCESS STORIES,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/vegan-kickstarter-success-stories,"DECEMBER 11, 2011","Given the current state of the economy, funding a major project may seem like an insurmountable quest, no matter how amazing your business, book, film, or other idea may be. Fortunately, grassroots-fundraising site Kickstarter has made it easier than ever to rally financial support and build a fanbase, and the rules are simple—perfect a great idea, join the fundraising site, and set a funding goal for what it takes to turn your dream into a reality. Voilà! The only catch is that Kickstarter projects must reach the entirety of their funding goals in order to receive any of the pledged donations. This all-or-nothing tactic hasn’t scared inventive people away, though—the fundraising site has helped more than 15,000 projects take off. This year, we’ve watched an array of vegan foods, businesses, media, and other ventures fund their way to success. Check out how these cruelty-free Kickstarter success stories came to be and what we can expect to see from them in 2012. Vegucated
When filmmaker Marisa Miller Wolfson finished shooting her documentary Vegucated, she knew the story of the film’s three meat- and cheese-loving subjects journey to a vegan diet could inspire many other omnivores to follow suit. The only problem was the associated expense of reaching a broad audience. So, Wolfson applied to film festivals, developed a marketing plan, worked out the logistics of a distribution budget, and decided to seek funding via Kickstarter. Her ambitious $20,000 goal was no match for her dedicated fanbase, though—the Vegucated Kickstarter received more than double its request, totaling upwards of $40,000. Marisa has since taken her film on tour across the US and brought home the honor of Best Documentary Feature from the Toronto Independent Film Festival, but she’s not stopping in 2011—next year, she will launch her community screenings campaign, where individuals can host local community screenings and discussions of Vegucated. Vegan Road Trip
Blogger Kristin Lajeunesse dreams big—in honor of the five-year anniversary of her conversion to veganism, she decided to take a year-long road trip to visit every vegan restaurant in America. Keeping costs as low as possible by planning to sleep in her car and work while traveling, she developed a modest budget of $10,000 for her epic road trip. Lajeunesse initially planned to self-fund the venture, but after reevaluating her expenses, she turned to her readers, friends, and family for capital suggestions. Many recommended Kickstarter, but she was skeptical of reaching her funding goal. Lajeunesse made it clear that her trip was not going to be a vacation—she was going to work hard to develop an all-inclusive guide to vegan restaurants in the US—but would Kickstarter donors believe in her to get the job done? She bravely decided to go for it and requested funding on the site. Donors responded by not only helping her reach the funding goal, but exceeding it by nearly $3,000. She has since hit the road and is currently working her way down the East Coast. For 2012, check her blog Will Travel for Vegan Food for the latest updates and inside scoops on the nation’s best restaurants. Pop-Up Vegan Restaurant
New York City experienced its first plant-based pop-up restaurant for three exclusive days in June, thanks to Chef Ayinde Howell. But he’s not the only one who deserves gratitude from diners—in May, more than 160 generous people helped Howell reach his $17,000 funding goal, which he used to secure a $10,000 rental space and finance other logistical expenses. More than 500 people ate at WildFlower during its only weekend open, and Howell wowed the masses with menu items like Vegan Mac ‘n’ Yease, “Chicken” and Waffles, Cherry Cobbler-Topped Biscuits, and Poblano Scramble Tofu. When asked what advice he could offer other potential restaurant entrepreneurs, Howell replied, “First, you need nerves of steel. Next, have a unique idea and be aware of your audience. Above all else, have the right intention behind what you’re doing.” He tells VegNews that he’d like to take WildFlower to Toronto, Los Angeles, and London in the future. Indie Magazine
The creators of Chickpea magazine, Cara Livermore and Bob Lawton, impressed readers with the first issue of the digital publication’s sophisticated design, vibrant photographs, and deeply personal stories so much that launching a Kickstarter campaign for a print edition was almost a no-brainer. Readers gushed to Livermore that the magazine was “top-notch” and she had already received writing, photography, and recipe submissions for a future issue. The pair set a goal of $1,000 in October and found themselves completely funded in just three days. By the time the October 13 fundraising deadline passed, they had received more than $8,500 in donations from 222 backers. The printed version sold out in early December, but readers can expect to see issue two on January 1, 2012. Do you have a great Kickstarter project idea? These successful fundraisers prove that Kickstarter can help raise capital and awareness for amazing vegan projects, no matter the size of the proposal or budget. There’s no better time than the start of the new year to launch your idea! "
MIT VEGAN COOKING DEMO,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/mit-vegan-cooking-demo,"DECEMBER 10, 2011","In conjunction with its new expanded House Dining program through food-management company Bon Appétit, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has brought chef Brian McCarthy to campus to educated students about vegan cooking. McCarthy, author of The Vegan Family Cookbook, visited last week to showcase various techniques for meat-free cooking, as well as offer tastings, answer students’ questions, and sign copies of his book. McCarthy started preparing vegan food 17 years ago when his family started eating a plant-based diet. The chef tells MIT News, “When you have kids … you want them to have the apple pie and the chocolate pudding you grew up with. So that’s why it was important to have this vegan cookbook.” "
VEGAN FOOD TRUCK HITS NYC,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/vegan-food-truck-hits-nyc,"DECEMBER 9, 2011","Vegan New Yorkers are in luck—the popular Cinnamon Snail food truck has begun making the rounds in Midtown, serving fresh vegan breakfast and lunch fare. It took nearly two years for owner Adam Sobel to acquire a permit to serve in the Big Apple, previously bringing his truck’s cruelty-free fare only to its hometown of Hoboken, NJ. Now, New Yorkers seeking tasty morning or afternoon vegan cuisine can dine on items like Coconut Hempseed-Crusted French Toast, Chipotle Seitan Burritos, and Red Curry Grilled Tofu Bánh Mì. Sobel hopes to operate the truck in as many neighborhoods as possible that do not have access to quality vegan food. "
SMITHFIELD TO PHASE OUT CRATES,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/smithfield-to-phase-out-crates,"DECEMBER 8, 2011","Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in the world, has committed to phasing out the use of gestation crates at all of its facilities by 2017. The Humane Society of the United States had been urging the company to recommit to a timeline after it first pledged to discontinue use of the crates in 2007, but adjourned efforts in 2009. HSUS is now urging other major meat producers, such as Tyson and Hormel, to follow suit and eliminate use of the crates, which eight states and the entire European Union have already passed legislation to phase out. Gestation crates are used to confine sows for most or all of their adult lives, increasing stress levels and prohibiting them from turning around, lying down comfortably, or exhibiting natural behaviors. "
BRENDAN BRAZIER FOOD SERVICE,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/brendan-brazier-food-service,"DECEMBER 8, 2011","Plant-based professional triathlete Brendan Brazier has launched a new vegan meal delivery service, dubbed Thrive Foods Direct, for those with active lifestyles. The new program offers three levels of nutrient-dense meals, depending on the participants’ health and exercise routines, including the basic plan ($45), Thrive Plus ($55 and includes a serving of Vega Complete Whole Food Health Optimizer), and Thrive Pro ($75, contains larger portions and additional Vega products). Thrive Foods Direct provides breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with menu items like Asian Carrot Salad, Blueberry Chia Pudding, and Mixed Mushroom Risotto. The program corresponds with his book Thrive Foods, which was published in September. "
TODAY EXPOSES PUPPY MILLS,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/today-exposes-puppy-mills,"DECEMBER 7, 2011","Yesterday morning, NBC’s Today aired an inside look at the cruelty behind commercial puppy mills, focusing on the Humane Society of the United States’ investigation of online puppy seller Purebred Breeders LLC. The animal-welfare organization found that while Purebred Breeders claimed to raise healthy, well-cared-for puppies, in reality their dogs suffered in cramped, unsanitary cages without proper veterinary care or socialization. Additionally, HSUS discovered that the company owns roughly 800 separate websites, misleading customers into believing that they are buying from local breeders. HSUS has teamed up with irate consumers and consumer-justice law firm Leopold-Kuvin to file a lawsuit against Purebred Breeders in Florida state court. "
VEGAN SUPERMARKET EXPANDS,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/vegan-supermarket-expands,"DECEMBER 7, 2011","Veganz, one of Europe’s only 100-percent vegan supermarkets, has just revealed plans to undergo a massive expansion in 2012. The first storefront opened in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood in August and owner Jan Bredack tells NPR that he will open a store in Berlin’s Friedrichshain borough later this year. Next year, Bredack says that they plan to expand to every major German city, as well as Vienna, Austria. Veganz boasts a massive cruelty-free selection of products from staples to gourmet treats. Product manager Lena Einecke tells NPR, “We don’t intend for Veganz to be a health food shop, but rather a general store where customers of all persuasions can shop.” "
EAT MORE KALE VS. CHICK-FIL-A,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/eat-more-kale-vs-chick-fil-a,"DECEMBER 7, 2011","Chick-Fil-A, the second-largest chicken restaurant chain in the country, is suing artist Bo Muller-Moore for attempting to copyright his t-shirts emblazoned with the phrase “Eat More Kale,” under the claim that he is infringing on the company’s slogan “Eat Mor Chikin.” A Chick-Fil-A lawyer argues in a public letter that Muller-Moore’s pro-kale catchphrase “is likely to cause confusion of the public and dilutes the distinctiveness of Chick-fil-A’s intellectual property and diminishes its value.” However, the state of Vermont has expressed its support of the artist, with Governor Peter Shumlin pledging to help Muller-Moore defend his business, which the state believes exemplifies the state’s “agricultural renaissance” and strong support of locally grown food initiatives. Sales of the t-shirts have skyrocketed as Muller-Moore’s story has gained mainstream publicity. "
ELIZA DUSHKU DITCHES MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/eliza-dushku-ditches-meat,"DECEMBER 6, 2011","Actress Eliza Dushku, best known for her roles on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and True Calling, has switched to a plant-based diet after seeing the documentary Forks Over Knives.

Co-owners Daniel Dunbar and Christopher Hollowell—whose names are pieced together for their business’ moniker—declared their project “the premiere vegan doughnut shop on planet Earth” when they launched their Indiegogo fundraiser in September. Hollowell tells Gothamist that the shop will feature more than 50 different flavors, including Earl Grey Tea, Mexican Chocolate, Lavender Lemon, and Faux Gras—a tongue-in-cheek delicacy that made headlines earlier this fall when Dun-Well veganized another Brooklyn restaurant’s controversial foie-gras doughnut.

TAIWAN BANS SHARK FINNING,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/taiwan-bans-shark-finning,"DECEMBER 4, 2011","Starting in 2012, Taiwan will make history as the first Asian nation to ban shark finning. To obtain the central ingredient in shark-fin soup, fisherman use the cruel practice of shark finning—cutting the fins off sharks and throwing them back in the ocean to drown. While the new law doesn’t prohibit shark fishing, it disallows the practice of bringing the shark back in pieces, a measure which should reduce Taiwan’s status as the fourth largest shark-fin industry in the world. The Taiwanese ban is part of a growing worldwide trend, as the European Union has banned the practice and the state of California will prohibit the sale or use of the fins starting in 2013. "
HORSE SLAUGHTER BAN LIFTED,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/horse-slaughter-ban-lifted,"DECEMBER 4, 2011","Last week, President Obama signed a new bill ending the ban on the federal inspection of horses who are raised for food, effectively legalizing human consumption of horse meat in the US. Animal-rights groups’ reactions to the new law, however, have been mixed. The Humane Society of the United States and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals came out against the new law, but People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals supports the change, believing that domestic horse-slaughter facilities are safer and more humane than shipping the animals to foreign countries. PETA President Ingrid Newkirk tells the Christian Science Monitor, “… the reason we didn’t support it, which sets us almost alone, is the amount of suffering that it created exceeded the amount of suffering it was designed to stop.” According to the Government Accounting Office, horse exports from the US to Mexico have risen 660 percent since the now-lifted domestic horse slaughter ban began five years ago.

HOLIDAY PARTY TIPS WITH THE TIPSY VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/holiday-party-tips-with-the-tipsy-vegan,"DECEMBER 4, 2011","Ah, holiday party season—a time for celebrating the season of giving, namely through heaps of hors d’oeuvres and bevies of boozy beverages. What better authority to consult for the gift of perfect partying than the author of The Tipsy Vegan, John Schlimm. Whether your bash is swanky or casual, for cool-heeled cousins or for boisterous buddies, the Tipsy Vegan himself has got you covered with the best drinks, snacks, and tips that will make your gathering stress-free and satisfying for all. Schlimm shares his most coveted recipes and tips for holiday magic exclusively for VN, and he delivered like a reindeer-drawn sleigh full of presents. The Tipsy Vegan’s Top Holiday Party Tips The First Rule: There are no rules (sort of).
There really are no rules for throwing a memorable get-together with family and friends, as long as your bar is well-stocked, you have delicious food, and, most importantly, you’re ready to have the time of your life! As host or hostess with the most(est), you set the tone from the minute the invites go out. Seasonal Sippers
Cocktails are of the utmost importance. Every party bar should have a standard selection of white and red wines, vodka, whiskey, gin, rum, tequila, and a few different types of beer, but nothing screams holiday party like a specialty drink tailored to the season. One or two specialty cocktails—like the Holly Jolly Peppermintini or Tipsy Elf’s Punch—are fun for sure, but a menu of four or five is even better, and will really knock your guests’ socks off (and maybe even more by night’s end!). Cocktail Clues 
For specialty drinks, offer both sampling-size glasses, to allow guests to try each concoction with minimal commitment, as well as regular-size glasses for when they pick their favorite. Infuse cocktails with your personal flair by giving them fun names and adding unique, seasonal garnishes and special touches, such as using icicles or tightly packed snowballs in place of ice cubes. Just be sure that the snow or ice is fresh and crystal clear, if you catch my drift. For the overachievers among us (you know who you are!), printing a specialty cocktail menu that lists the main ingredients and displaying it on the bar will no doubt garner you kudos, not to mention the inevitable Martha Stewart comparisons.  Gentle Jollity
Please note that not all boozy spirits are created equally or compassionately, so barnivore.com is the go-to source for determining which types and brands of alcohol are vegan-friendly. For vegan versions of ingredients like chocolate syrup and gelatin, try veganessentials.com for a huge selection of cruelty-free products. Smart Snacking
With an open bar flowing, you need to have something for your guests to munch on. A few gourmet finger foods that are quick and easy to prepare will hit the spot and help guests hold their liquor. For my holiday hors d’oeuvre menu, I’ve taken some classics of the cocktail circuit—bruschetta, chickpea dip, and stuffed mushrooms—and supercharged them with fresh ingredients and a few of our favorites from the bar. For more boozy finger-food options, check out the Plastered Party Starters chapter in The Tipsy Vegan, like Plastered Portobello Mushroom Satay and Chocolate-Soused Strawberries.  Happy Endings
Of course, it wouldn’t be a party without a few sweets. However, unless you are a dedicated baker, I suggest spoiling yourself and your guests with a tray of goodies from such sites as naturalcandystore.com, which has vegan candy canes, caramels, toffee, and more, or a selection of vegan marshmallow treats from sweetandsara.com. Finally, and most importantly, the absolute best accoutrement of any party, big or small, is laughter! And plenty of it. May your holidays be happy and buzz-worthy!

MCCARTNEY CRITIQUES LUNCHES,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/mccartney-critiques-lunches,"DECEMBER 4, 2011","Ex-Beatle Sir Paul McCartney is speaking out against a new law that effectively banned vegetarian meals in French schools by requiring all meals to include meat or dairy. McCartney, a long-time vegetarian and campaigner for the Meatless Monday initiative, criticized the measure on his website: “The French Government’s recent decree effectively enforcing the consumption of animal products in public institutions is a backward step for France. It goes against the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union by prohibiting individuals’ right to express their beliefs.” The new law will affect roughly six million French students. "
10 WAYS TO FIGHT HOLIDAY STRESS,https://vegnews.com/2011/12/10-ways-to-fight-holiday-stress,"DECEMBER 4, 2011","December has begun and the holiday season is in full swing. We know you love the gift-wrapping, cookie-making, carol-singing joy of it all; but between the ribbon curling and party throwing, you still need to find time to deck your dingy halls, make your own holiday cards, and find the perfect, professional gift for your boss. Let’s be honest, sometimes the holidays can be a little, well, stressful. To which we stay, stop, take a deep breath, and know that it’s all going to be OK. VN serves up 10 no-fail stress-busters to keep you jolly all season long. 1. Don’t try to re-invent the wheel
Time-honored traditions are that way for a reason. So while it’s fun to create your own spin on the holidays, don’t take on too many new projects at once. Stick to the classics: Gather with the family and watch your favorite holiday movie, make the favorite holiday baked goods instead of attempting a new one that’s too complicated, and cook a classic dish for which you don’t even need a recipe. By relying on old favorites, you’ll be comforted knowing that these traditions work, and that not everything is going to blow up—even if it sometimes seems like it. 2. Know your limits
More often than not, the season of giving can turn into the season of endlessly saying “yes.” For your own sake, do not sign up for every bake sale, and try to keep at least some of the family get-togethers at your relatives’ homes. The same goes for your budget—sure, we’d all love to give everyone in the family a new iPhone, but is that really the best financial way to start out 2012? Probably not. Know your own budgetary limits. You’ll feel much more relaxed when you’re not stretching yourself, or your wallet, too thin. 3. Bake ahead
Of course, cookies are one of the best parts of the season. Who doesn’t love smothering everything in sight with frosting and sprinkles? Save yourself a little time in the kitchen and forego making a completely new batch every other night. Instead, take one Sunday afternoon and make a few batches of cookie dough, such as Beverly Lynn Bennet’s Sugar Cookie Dough recipe, and then freeze it. Later, you can thaw and bake darling little cookies, such as these snowflakes, in half the time. 4. Give a little back
Whether it’s letting someone cut in front of you in traffic or donating toys to charity, giving back can ease up stress during the holidays. You’ll feel better about yourself, about the holiday season in general, and about making a small difference. In fact, a study released in 2007 by the Corporation for National and Community Service found there is a strong connection between volunteering and good health—people with the philanthropic spirit literally have stronger hearts and lower rates of depression. 5. Adopt an animal
The winter can be especially harsh for homeless companion animals in need of good homes. If you and your family are ready to let a little furry friend into the mix, head to your local shelter and adopt! Not only will you feel warm inside from having saved the life of an animal, but a study from Clemson University found a positive correlation between regular interaction with animals and happiness. Not ready to take in a little one right now? Volunteer at a shelter by taking dogs for walks, cuddling kitties, or donate some much-needed pet food. 6. Eat well
While it’s tempting to taste everything you bake and indulge in rich dinners, make sure you’re eating at least one healthy meal each day. This will keep you feeling light, energized, and upbeat, and staying healthy will help keep your stress levels down. Try an Easy Antipasto Salad, a Seasonal Smoothie, or, of course, the never-fail green juice. Feeling a cold coming on in all the hustle and bustle? Be sure to take care of yourself, the whole-foods way. 7. Keep the house tidy
Amidst wrapping paper, bake-a-thons, and holiday card making, the house can become a tornado scene and induce a panic attack when it comes time to entertain. Take the 20 minutes to put away your crafts or wash the dishes, and you’ll save yourself a world of stress in the long run. Want to make your own cleaners instead of the chemical-laden store-bought brands? VegWeb has the solutions you need! 8. Let others help you
Whatever you do, don’t try to go at it alone. Whether it’s suggesting this year’s holiday party takes on a potluck theme or or asking your best friend to bring over a few bottles of vino, by asking, you can help others help you. 9. Remember to enjoy the holiday season
It only comes but once a year, make sure you are taking plenty of moments here and there to soak in the atmosphere, the music, the smells, and of course, your loved ones. All too often the holidays can fly by and you only have blurry digital photographs to remember it by. Instead, savor the moment and the season like you did when you were a kid, because before you know it, it’ll be gone. 11. Make time for you
In order to decompress you need to make a little time for you. Read a book, take a bath, go for a run, take that yoga class you haven’t been to in weeks, allow yourself a power nap, watch your favorite television show, and so forth. The point of all this is that you allow your brain to stop spinning for a little bit so that you feel recharged and ready to make the 2011 holiday season the best yet! "

Dubbed Matt’s Munchies, the premium fruit snacks contain no artificial ingredients and six flavors are certified organic by the US Department of Agriculture.

FACTORY FARMING REFORM PETITION,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/factory-farming-reform-petition,"NOVEMBER 30, 2011","On November 18, a new campaign was launched to petition the federal government to reform food policies and reduce the damaging consequences of factory farming. Started as a result of the National Conference to End Factory Farming that took place in October, the petition demands increased measures to control farming waste disposal, elimination of inhumane treatment of animals, increased plant-based nutrition education, and reducing the excessive use of antibiotics in animal agriculture, among other aims. More than 1,000 people have already signed the petition, but it needs a total of 25,000 supporters by December 28 in order to reach the Obama administration. "
PSYCHOLOGY OF MEAT-EATERS,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/psychology-of-meat-eaters,"NOVEMBER 30, 2011","A new study from Australia’s University of Queensland reports that meat-eaters tend to deny that the animals they eat have mental capacities. Developed by Brock Bastian, PhD, and colleagues at the university’s School of Psychology, the research concludes that people are less troubled about eating meat if they believe the animals lack intellect and emotions—views that can also contribute to reduced concern for animal welfare during meat production. “In short, our work highlights the fact that although most people do not mind eating meat, they do not like thinking of animals they eat as having possessed minds,” says Bastian. His work will be published in greater detail in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. "
USDA FINES RINGLING BROS CIRCUS,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/usda-fines-ringling-bros-circus,"NOVEMBER 30, 2011","The US Department of Agriculture has charged Feld Entertainment Inc., the producer of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, with a $270,000 fine after finding that the company repeatedly violated the federal Animal Welfare Act between June 2007 and August 2011. Feld Entertainment agreed to the settlement and promised to implement new animal-training protocols for employees in lieu of a hearing, but did not admit to violating the Animal Welfare Act. The fine was issued after a federal appeals court dismissed a lawsuit against the company previously filed by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Animal Protection Institute, which alleged that the circus violated the Endangered Species Act and systematically mistreated elephants and other animals.

SNOW-FILLED SKI ESCAPES,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/snow-filled-ski-escapes,"NOVEMBER 30, 2011","Taking a winter holiday to a ski chalet is one of the most traditional ways to embrace the months of snow, ice, and little sun. Both in the US and abroad, fully serviced ski chalets, resorts, and hotels offer a simple way to escape with as little hassle as possible. Though finding lodging willing to cater to your vegetarian diet might be a challenge, with some good faith and guidance, discovering that scene-from-a-snow-globe vacation isn’t hard to do. Skiology
Les Carroz and Morzine, France
Nestled in the French Alps, Skiology has four vegan-friendly chalets to choose from—two in Les Carroz: Deux Freres and Chalet Du Bois, and two in Morzine: Chalet La Roche and Chalet Lisiere. Called a “true foodie ski experience,” the chalets have created special menus catering to vegans. Skiology’s menu includes mixed mountain mushroom stroganoff with cêpes and morelles, the resort’s famous Bloody Mary soup, and pears poached in vin chaud—not to mention the endless wine, tea, and coffee delivered right to your room each morning. And due to its prime location in the mountains, you can start a day atop a French mountain and ski right into Switzerland—passport in tow, of course. La Source Ski
Montchavin-Les Coches, France
For an equally charming French Alp experience in a more intimate setting, La Source Ski supplies a wide range of vegan options. The unparalled views and quaintness of this part of the Alps and the original alpine-style architecture of the chalet makes La Source an idyllic place to vacation and enjoy the crisp mountain air. Co-owner Linda Dungilson is vegetarian herself, and designs the menus to be extremely veg-friendly—think soy yogurt and cereal for breakfast, followed by a lovely afternoon tea, and a three-course meal that includes anything from chestnut red wine en cruet, cabbage spring rolls, or Mediterranean vegetable tartlet for dinner. Haus Leo
Westendorf, Austria
For a more quaint and authentic excursion into the Alps, look no further than bed-and-breakfast Haus Leo. Since opening in 1971, Haus Leo has had vegetarian options on its menu, and vegan cuisine is always available on request. Last year, the chalet switched to serving exclusively vegetarian and vegan breakfasts that include juices, fruits, and rice milk. As for skiing, Haus Leo is located in an area that provides diverse terrains, from safer skiing conditions for more novice skiers to challenging runs for snowboarders and the snow bunnies with more experience. What’s more, the inn is only minutes away from the nearest gondola, so no need to lug heavy gear around town. Nita Lake Lodge
Whistler, Canada
Luxury boutique hotel Nita Lake Lodge resides near the charming town of Whistler in British Columbia, Canada, and borders the southern Pacific ranges of Canada’s Coast Mountains. Move at a slower pace here, with the option to venture into bustling Whistler—which attracts more than two million eager skiers annually—whenever you please. All three of the restaurants available at Nita Lake Lodge provide local and organic foods (often picked from the lodge’s rooftop garden), but Fix Café and Deli takes dining to another level with vegetarian, vegan, and wheat-free dishes that satisfy every diet and taste. Moving Mountains Chalets
Steamboat Springs, Colorado
For a domestic winter holiday with a vegan edge, look no further than Steamboat Springs, CO and the Moving Mountains Chalets. The catered chalets come with a personal chef who creates customized menus for every party, including vegan meals. Simply let the resort know of your preferences before you arrive, and everything will be ready upon arrival. Babysitting, shuttles to town, and grocery-shopping services ensure that visits are hassle-free, so travelers can focus completely on the slopes. The resort tries to reduce its carbon footprint through reduced energy consumption and by conserving water, among other endeavors. "

According to Terces Engelhart, the decision to close the seven locations—located in Berkeley, Cupertino, Healdsburg, Oakland, San Francisco, San Rafael, and Santa Cruz—is due to “a series of aggressive lawsuits.” While Engelhart does not explain the nature of the lawsuits, San Francisco news outlet The Bay Citizen reports two suits brought against the Engelharts from former Café Gratitude employees, who cite being deprived of shift breaks, earned tips, and overtime pay. Engelhart says on Facebook that the locations “will be open for at least a few months depending on the sales of our locations.” Gracias Madre, the Engelharts’ vegan Mexican restaurant located in San Francisco, is also for sale; however, Café Gratitude’s Los Angeles location will remain open.

According to the infographic, which used data from a 2008 Vegetarian Times study, 3.2 percent of the US adult population—or about 7.3 million people—are vegetarian, with an additional one million identifying as vegan. Another 22.8 million people abide by a “mostly vegetarian diet.” The top reasons that people cited for going veg are for personal health, animal welfare, and environmental concerns, followed by holistic wellness, food safety, and weight management.

LAW HIDES ANIMAL CRUELTY CASES,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/law-hides-animal-cruelty-cases,"NOVEMBER 28, 2011","Last month, a new animal cruelty law went into effect in Nevada that increases the penalties for torturing or killing animals from misdemeanors to felonies, but a last-minute amendment makes the abuse cases secret from the public. Nicknamed “Cooney’s Law” after a dog named Cooney was brutally killed in a Reno hotel, the new measure has animal-rights activists concerned that it limits rescue organizations’ abilities to investigate cruelty cases and seek assistance from the public to care for abused animals. Gina Greisen of Nevada Voters for Animals tells the Reno Gazette-Journal, “Not being able to talk about these cases makes it difficult for us as animal welfare advocates. The whole point was the protect the reporting party, not the alleged offender.” "

The Kindness Collective “works at the intersection of human and animal welfare,” according to its website, and seeks to help the approximately 40 percent of domestic-abuse victims who are afraid to leave their violent environments out of concern for the fate of their companion animals.

While the program aims to generate revenue from overseas markets, it also endangers the businesses of small farmers, increases the prevalence of health conditions associated with the Standard American Diet, and contributes to industry dominance for the mega-corporations who are benefiting from the program.

VEGAN IN UPSTATE NY,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/vegan-in-upstate-ny,"NOVEMBER 27, 2011","Not many people get to experience the splendor of the majestic Catskill Mountains, the beauty of the winding Hudson River, and the quaint, small-town friendliness that comes with living in the Hudson Valley region of upstate New York, but the residents of the historic towns of Saugerties and Woodstock have that fortune. In addition to the breathtaking scenery, the area is also home to tasty vegan food, heartwarming rescued animals, and a renowned art scene. Venture to this unique area for a weekend retreat—at just over 100 miles away from New York City, it’s easily accessible and you’ll be charmed by the welcoming communities of Saugerties and Woodstock. Hospitality to All
With two farm animal sanctuaries within 20 miles, could a weekend retreat in the peaceful Catskill Mountains get any better? First stop—Catskill Animal Sanctuary in Saugerties, where visitors can meet more than 200 rescued farm animals. Venture on a heartwarming tour to be inspired by the relationships between the free-range animals, volunteers, and sanctuary staff, while learning about the cruel practices of big agribusiness and the importance of compassionate rescue organizations like CAS. This intimate sanctuary also offers specialty tours with Kathy Stevens, the knowledgeable director and founder of the organization. Next up, head to Willow, NY, just outside of Woodstock, to meet and greet rescued chickens, cows, ducks, goats, and sheep who call Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary home. Be sure to say hi to Stanley the pig, who bounds towards any human for a belly rub or a treat. Tours run from April 1 to October 31, so if you’re visiting during the off-season, schedule a few hours to volunteer instead. With more than 200 rescued animals roaming the sanctuary grounds, there’s plenty to do, and the organization thrives on support from compassionate volunteers. Have Your Fill
You cannot visit Ulster County without checking out the Garden Café—the area’s only all-vegan restaurant. Frequented by author Kris Carr (who lives in the area) and other celebrities, Garden Café is located in central Woodstock and serves enticing dishes like Pan-Seared Tofu with Pistachio Gravy over Butternut Squash Mash, Baked Seitan with Red Wine Fig Sauce, Grilled Curry Tofu Mango Sandwiches, and make-your-own macrobiotic bowls. For a happy ending, indulge in the Carrot Apricot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting—you’ll never feel the same way about dessert. For internationally inspired cuisine, make a reservation at the groovy New World Home Cooking Co., nestled between Saugerties and Woodstock. Chef Ric Orlando, a member of Slow Food USA, uses local ingredients to maximize flavor and seasonality on his ever-changing menus. The vegan Pan-Blackened String Beans, a permanent menu fixture, are famous among locals for their crispy edges and fiery Creole spices. The menu is not 100-percent vegan, but Orlando dedicates an entire section on the summer menu exclusively to vegan dinners and provides ample options during the other seasons, with options like Blue Corn-Crusted Seitan Medallions served with smooth tomatillo salsa, Beans and Rice Utility Dinner with every vegetable in the kitchen and an optional chimichurri-tofu add-on, and Nyon Olive-Crusted Tofu Steaks with olive oil mashers, braised greens, and Muhammara sauce. The vegan options are sweet through the end, with selections like Chocolate Coconut “Access” Cupcakes, fresh fruit crisps, and homemade sorbets. Other foodie highlights in the area include Oriole 9’s savory tofu hash brunch, the Hudson Valley Dessert Company’s highly sought-after cranberry-walnut granola (a great road trip snack!), and tasty bar munchies like Coconut Tofu to accompany cocktails at The Pig Bar and Grill. Keep an eye on the menu at the newly opened Healthy Gourmet To-Go storefront; owner Roni Shapiro has plans to open the gourmet vegan food-delivery headquarters to the public for in-house dining in the near future. For more amazing food, ask local shopkeepers—they are the most knowledgeable people in the area regarding new businesses and eateries. Get Tucked In
For an authentic Hudson Valley experience with a compassionate edge, a stay at the Guesthouse at Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary is essential. Get cozy in the pre-Civil War era farmhouse-turned-bed-and-breakfast, where a live rooster will serve as your alarm clock, the vegan continental breakfast is both bottomless and hearty, and the stunning mountain views will render you blissful. Located right on the sanctuary premises, you’ll be charmed by neighboring animal friends greeting you each morning. As if you needed another reason to stay there, the sanctuary uses all profits to support its ongoing rescue efforts. If kitschy is what you look for in a hotel, nowhere is better suited than Kate’s Lazy Meadow Motel in nearby Mt. Tremper. With your choice of an Airstream trailer, cabin, lodge, or shack as accommodations, you’ll feel right at home at this retro-themed motel, co-owned by the B-52’s singer Kate Pierson. Keeping clean is a treat to boot: the complimentary international toiletries are right from Pierson’s collections from her worldwide tours. If you’re willing to drive about 40 minutes from the area, the Hungry Ghost Guest House in New Paltz serves all-vegan breakfasts at its comfortable “active retreat” facility. Options abound, so check the site to determine which type of living quarters will best suit your needs and desires. The Complete Package
The elegance and serenity of the Catskill Mountains and the surrounding flora have drawn people to the area for centuries. While much of this tourism associated with the famous Jewish resorts of the first half of the 20th century faded after the 1960s and left many hotel signs permanently on “vacancy,” Saugerties and Woodstock have continued to thrive as cultural hotspots throughout the past two decades. Take a short hike to the famous Saugerties Lighthouse and gaze at the Hudson River, and bring a picnic lunch to make a day of it. For a longer trek, Overlook Mountain has great trails suitable for nearly any skill level, and offers outstanding views of the lush Hudson Valley.

FOOD DEMAND TO DOUBLE BY 2050,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/food-demand-to-double-by-2050,"NOVEMBER 26, 2011","Researchers from the University of Minnesota say that global food demand could double by 2050, leading to detrimental effects on the environment. Published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research suggests that the huge increase in food demand can be supplied with less environmental impact if poor nations adopt nitrogen-efficient farming techniques, rather than clearing more land. Leading the study, professor of ecology David Tilman says that global agriculture is currently responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions. Earlier this year, the Environmental Working Group analyzed the carbon footprints of 20 different foods—topping the list were lamb, beef, cheese, pork, and farmed salmon. "

Scientists then analyzed their semen samples, finding that men with poor diets had a reduced sperm count and subsequently partners with lower pregnancy rates. Conversely, men who consumed a diet rich in grains like wheat, oats, and barley, had increased rates of sperm concentration, and those who ate a lot of fruit had faster and more agile sperm. "

The organization also accepts donations via its website to help fund the pizza program and its vegan kitchens at the occupations. He estimates that at least 5,000 volunteers have worked with occupations in the US and as far away as Sydney, Budapest, London, and Frankfurt.

THANKFUL TURKEYS: MEET HENRIETTA,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/thankful-turkeys-meet-henrietta,"NOVEMBER 21, 2011","Say hello to Henrietta, a rescued turkey from upstate New York’s Catskill Animal Sanctuary. Nestled in the magnificent Catskill Mountains, she stays toasty by snuggling in deep beds of hay during the chilling autumn months. But life was different for this lovely lady just last year—raised on a turkey farm, Henrietta’s fate was to be on a Thanksgiving dinner plate. A couple visited the farm to purchase the centerpiece for their upcoming November feast, but quickly realized that Henrietta displayed intelligent, emotional traits. They couldn’t bear the thought of slaughtering such a thoughtful creature, so they took her to CAS. The sanctuary’s founder and director Kathy Stevens calls Henrietta “the most delightful turkey” she’s ever known, and is endeared by Henrietta’s deep need to be around humans and the other 29 free-range rescued animals at the site. A star attraction among visitors, Henrietta will nuzzle up next to guests and let volunteers pet her soft white feathers for hours. Once destined for a cruel misfortune, Henrietta has found freedom, friends, and fulfillment at Catskill Animal Sanctuary. She also made best friends with Atlas the goat soon after arriving to the sanctuary, and the two could often be seen strolling around together and cuddling. Unfortunately, Atlas passed away last week and will be missed dearly by CAS staff, volunteers, and guests, but Henrietta will preserve his legacy by being a best friend to the rest of the CAS two- and four-legged residents.

The artist has started a cooking blog, We Be Vegan, with his girlfriend, Ruby, and is also interested in founding a hip-hop eco-festival, he tells the Guardian. "
FAILPROOF THANKSGIVING TIPS FROM THE VN EDITORS,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/failproof-thanksgiving-tips-from-the-vn-editors,"NOVEMBER 20, 2011","Between family drama, culinary chaos, and the party frenzy, the holidays can be about as relaxing as a root canal. The VegNews editorial team is here to help! We’ve seen and heard it all, and are here with our wisdom and witticisms that we hope will keep you thankful, rather than resentful, that the holiday season is here. Stay cozy and don’t miss another wink of sleep over entertaining woes, social discomforts, or merry meal-planning. Associate Publisher Colleen Holland
When hosting a Thanksgiving dinner, I like to keep the meal simple, balanced, and manageable. There’s no rule book that says you have to prepare 20 dishes in order to appease your guests. Pull together a menu with six outstanding dishes—my favorites are a caramelized pecan salad, pumpkin soup, roasted potatoes, homemade stuffing, a stunning centerpiece, and a chocolate dessert. Create an inviting and warm atmosphere, and enjoy the day.  Managing Editor Elizabeth Castoria
My trick for managing stress during the holidays is the same as it is throughout the rest of the year: Be grateful. This works especially well for Thanksgiving, given the theme, but really applies any time. When things go wrong during the holidays, it’s usually along the lines of someone accidentally let the dogs into the yard, an ingredient for a dish went missing, or Aunt Tina enjoyed a tad too much “holiday cheer” and started making inappropriate toasts. On a scale from “zero” to “actual problem,” these kinds of issues barely flick the needle. Being grateful for quality time with our loved ones, being able to share a meal together, and for the homes in which we celebrate the holidays makes Thanksgiving-related trifles trivial.  Associate Editor Jennifer Chen
A week before Thanksgiving, plan out exactly what recipes you’ll be making, write up a grocery list, and shop ahead of time to avoid the inevitably empty shelves the week of Thanksgiving. I once had to drive around to several grocery stores looking for canned pumpkin because it was gone. This is what happens when you don’t plan ahead! Most of my friends and family aren’t vegetarian or vegan, so I whip up my best recipes. Vegan garlicky sour cream mashed potatoes, a juicy Tofurky, and cranberry bars are my go-to dishes to serve. No one misses the meat or dairy because they are too busy stuffing their faces! Online Editor Anna Peraino
Plan ahead. I mean menu-planning, reading recipes days before the big event, and organizing how the day will go. Serving roasted veggies? Cut up your veggies the day before. Making pie? Roll out that crust before Thanksgiving Day. And you can always make your sauces early. The more you plan, the more time you have to spend with loved ones. Oh, and did I mention you’ll be less stressed? Because that’s always a major win. On another note: skeptical relatives? Yeah, most of us have those (unless you’re one of those people who comes from a vegan family, in which case, stop bragging!). Instead of apologizing for your veganism or being sheepish about your dairy-free pumpkin pie, talk that Seitan Wellington up (oh, and invite me over)! Studies show that if you’re positive, people around you are more likely react positively. Actually, I don’t know if that’s true, but you believed me, right? Confidence!  Editorial Assistant Joni Sweet
With all of the craziness that comes with being around the entire family and going home for the holidays, things tend to get stressful, despite the joyous occasion. My tip is to be sure to savor each and every bite of this once-a-year feast. Remember how infrequently we are able to get together with our loved ones to savor a home-cooked meal and work to change this. Think of Thanksgiving as a starting point to kick off a new year of gratitude and enjoyment. No matter how much your family may drive you crazy, they’re likely the people you’ll always be able to turn to for a home-cooked meal and a needed hug. Editorial Assistant Hilary Pollack
If your family’s even half as crazy as mine (doubtful, but possible), you may feel like you’re getting gray hairs by the minute when everyone gathers and mutiny immediately erupts. In order to regain perspective and enjoy myself while remaining a brunette, I try to think of our Thanksgiving feast as a zany sitcom where every person contributes his or her unique character to the social mix. Mishaps and misunderstandings are just another element of the fun, and always make the best stories in retrospect. In terms of food, I abide by three little words: keep it simple. A hearty entrée (always a Tofurky roast, in my case), a side or two (mashed potatoes are a must) and a pumpkincentric dessert are all you really need for belly-patting satisfaction. While the rest of my family is omnivorous, I find that cooking vegan dishes and presenting them alongside everything else with a smile always results in curious—and satisfied—takers. My final tip: a generously poured glass of Champagne can assuage most worries. "
HAPPY HOLIDAYS WITH OUR FAVORITE VEGAN HEALTH EXPERTS,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/happy-holidays-with-our-favorite-vegan-health-experts,"NOVEMBER 20, 2011","Our doctors help us understand our bodies and maximize our health, but they also know how to make the most out of the holidays. We asked some of our favorite docs to share their plans for this Thanksgiving, and the recipes that keep them smiling and satisfied throughout the season. Don’t worry—there’s cake involved. Neal Barnard, MD, is a clinical researcher and author, as well as the founder and president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. “A few years ago, I learned about the Native American tradition called the “Three Sisters,” in which corn, beans, and squash are grown on the same ground. It’s very simple: A few seeds of corn are placed in the ground. Around them, a few bean seeds are planted in a loosely circular way. Some squash seeds are placed nearby. This pattern is then repeated all down the garden. Each corn stalk provides a trellis for the beans. In turn, beans pull nitrogen from the air and fix it in the soil to fertilize the corn. Squash plants spread broad leaves across the ground, blocking out sunlight that would allow competitors to grow, so weeding is not necessary. Squash vines also have prickly thorns, protecting the plants from nocturnal nibblers. This simple method requires no fertilizer and pesticides, and almost no weeding. And, of course, these foods are wonderfully healthy—loaded with protein, but no cholesterol or animal fat.  Most of all, I like the symbolism—three disparate species getting along and supporting each other. So every Thanksgiving, I make a Three Sisters dinner, with butternut squash soup, a Three Sisters casserole, pumpkin pie, and lots of other goodies. My hope is to observe the day by reaffirming the value of living in harmony.” Michael Greger, MD, is the director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture at the Humane Society of the United States. “I have Thanksgiving WITH the turkeys every year! Poplar Spring Animal Sanctuary holds an annual potluck where we feed the turkeys, stuff ourselves, and then—the best part—feed pumpkins to the pigs (they go crazy!). Its one of the highlights of the year for many DC-area animal-friendly folks. At home, it’s pumpkin-smoothie time: take half a small seeded pumpkin, place cut-side down in a plate of water, microwave until soft, cool down, and blend with a cup of unsweetened plant-based milk, half a cup of frozen cranberries, 2 tablespoons of erythritol, and a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. Slackers can use canned pumpkin instead, but then you don’t get to roast the seeds for a post-smoothie snack!” Julieanna Heaver is a plant-based registered dietitian and American Council on Exercise-certified personal trainer who has worked in health and nutrition for 12 years. “I love celebrating Thanksgiving with an emphasis on gratitude for the health and life for my family, friends, and animals. Thus, I enjoy creating gorgeous, colorful, whole plant dishes honoring these factors and representing all of fall’s bounties. Typically, my dishes include deep orange pumpkin and sweet potatoes, yellow and bright orange squash, hearty whole grains like wild rice and quinoa, and brown, nutrient- and flavor-dense legumes like lentils and beans. I always include lovely leafy greens in just about everything, including kale salads, and added to stews and soups, for added color, flavor, and nutritional punch. There is something magical about inspiring others to realize they don’t have to forego flavor and indulgence by leaving out the animal products.” Matthew Lederman, MD, and his wife Alona Pulde, MD, are the authors of Keep It Simple, Keep It Whole: Your Guide to Optimum Health, and the founders of Exsalus Health and Wellness Center. “What would Thanksgiving be without a little ruckus, a buffet of food, and a lot of family? Nothing that we would recognize, and this year will be no exception. Starting the day early, we gather together and begin by sharing travel stories, which lead into jokes and the most embarrassing family memories. Then, to build an appetite for what will be a very generous meal, we go for a nice long walk. Exhausting ourselves into a famished state, we gather in line for an amazing assortment of delicious foods from yams, cranberries, stuffing, and mashed potatoes to less traditional foods like vegetable soup, Israeli salad, hummus, eggplant, and pasta. We spend an exorbitant amount of time around the table, less to talk and more to stuff, but what else can you do in the face of so many delicious options? Dinner is followed by dessert, which consists of cocoa truffles, almond pound cake, and carrot cake, and the evening generally culminates in casino night as we gamble away the family fortune.” Joel Fuhrman, MD, is the author of the New York Times best-selling Eat To Live and the just-released Super Immunity, and a board-certified family physician and nutritional researcher. “I like that holidays like Thanksgiving force me to hang out with relatives and stop working for an evening once in a while.  Workaholics like me need a little family time once in a while too, especially so my wife does not kill me. Eating a little too much inevitably happens, but I usually work out in the gym for a few hours on those days to hollow out my legs a little before I go. So my plan for this year is to get some new jokes ready for the meet-up; avoid the campylobacter, antibiotics, and hormones in a dead bird; and get to eat some of my favorite recipes in larger amounts.” Dr. Furhman’s Favorite Holiday Recipes

The petitions contend that the use of certain antibiotics in livestock increases the danger of antimicrobial resistance, rendering them less effective in treating human illness. The dual petitions, filed by a group of public-interest, medical, and animal-welfare organizations, were launched in 1999 and 2005, and the FDA announced its rejection of the appeals late last week. Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, comments to Food Safety News, “The industry has long failed to cooperate voluntarily, and the FDA should take binding action.” "
THANKFUL TURKEYS: PRECIOUS LIFE FLOCK,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/thankful-turkeys-precious-life-flock,"NOVEMBER 14, 2011","Co-founders of Sequim, WA’s Precious Life Animal Sanctuary Ralph and Caryl Turner didn’t expect to welcome nearly a dozen turkeys to their intimate facility, but neither did the residents of nearby La Conner, their hometown. Six years ago, a pair of birds decided to nest in the small tourist town and soon gained local popularity. The turkeys would strut past La Conner’s businesses, art galleries, and museums, and eventually the turkey was named the town’s official bird. But as their avian family grew to a total of 18, a vocal minority of townspeople spoke out against their presence, saying that the flock destroyed gardens and could potentially attack children. After it became apparent that the townspeople wanted to eliminate the birds by euthanizing them or using them for target practice, Precious Life Animal Sanctuary stepped in as the only option as a provider of long-term, humane care. Due to such a swift move-in, the birds were placed in a makeshift rabbit shelter, but were soon able to spread their wings after dedicated volunteers helped to swiftly build a new enclosure. Now, this loyal pack has become so comfortable, the ladies happily lay eggs and the males strut in full-bloom to impress their female counterparts. They even warble when visitors approach and are ever-curious creatures. Their favorite treats are peanut shells, sunflower seeds, and grapes, and they even leave fun surprises for children, who are pleased to find a shiny, iridescent turkey feather. To the Turners, they’re just another part of the family. More Thankful Turkeys:

The poll, conducted last spring, asked more than 1,000 adults about the frequency with which they eat a variety of meats and vegetarian foods. The journal reports that one-third of Americans say that they eat vegetarian meals a significant amount of the time, and approximately five percent of those polled identified as vegetarian, a proportion up two percent from 2009 figures. Half of those who identified as vegetarian adhered to a vegan diet, stating that they “never” eat meat, fish, seafood, poultry, dairy, or eggs, although honey consumption was not considered. Overall, an estimated 48 percent of the population claims to be looking for vegetarian foods, reflecting a high demand for meat-free options. "

While the price of a 16-pound turkey is up 22 percent, even a plant-based Thanksgiving will be more expensive than usual—frozen green peas are up 17 percent, a 30-ounce can of pumpkin-pie filling has risen 16 percent, and a 14-ounce bag of stuffing mix increased 9 percent. Additionally, fresh cranberries and a three-pound bag of sweet potatoes have risen 2.9 and 2.2 percent, respectively. The AFBF attributes the price increases to a greater demand for products and a lower supply due to this year’s poor weather conditions. "

In a recent survey, food-management company Bon Appétit found that the number of students who identify as vegetarian has increased by 50 percent between 2005 and 2010, and the number of vegan students has more than doubled.

VEG-FRIENDLY CHARITIES TO HELP THIS SEASON,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/veg-friendly-charities-to-help-this-season,"NOVEMBER 13, 2011","While indulgence in food, drink, and merriment is one of the defining practices of the holiday season, this time of year is also an opportunity to reflect on the ways that we can help others who are not as lucky. Warm your heart—and someone else’s—by donating to or working with one of these veg-friendly organizations that feed, shelter, and aid the less fortunate. Contributions don’t have to be monetary, either—many are in need of food, clothing, or even just a bit of your time.  Vegfam
Eager to help the hungry, but feeling conflicted about donating towards organizations that serve meat-heavy meals? Established in 1963, Vegfam has helped hundreds of thousands of people in need by funding plant-based food projects like fruit- and nut-tree planting, emergency food programs, and meal centers. Food and earthquake survivors, the homeless, orphanages, refugees, and HIV/AIDS sufferers are just a few of the groups to which Vegfam offers relief, and from 2005 to 2007, the organization benefited nearly more than 750,000 people in 12 countries. SALEM International
This nonprofit welfare organization works to share the values of peace, charity, and respect for life. SALEM places its ethical emphasis on nonviolence and respect for animals and human alike, offering healthcare, vocational training, shelter, and vegetarian meals to clinics in places including Ecuador, Germany, Russia, Togo, and Uganda. Improving the quality of life of thousands across the globe, this nondenominational Christian charity derived its name from the Hebrew “shalom,” meaning “peace.” The Vegetarian Charity
The UK-based Vegetarian Charity was formed in 1986 out of the Vegetarian Children’s Charity and the Vegetarian Home for Children, striving to feed and aid vegetarians and vegans 25 years or younger in age. It also aims to promote the knowledge and benefits of a cruelty-free lifestyle, awarding grants to relevant projects all over the world. The charity awards grants to vegetarian and vegan young people experiencing financial hardship, regardless of ethnic origin, race, or religion, in efforts to relieve poverty and assist with educational programs. The Vegetarian Charity also recently launched a vegan cooking course, teaching affordable and tasty plant-based recipes to applicants who are most in need.  East African Mission Orphanage
This children’s shelter, comprised of an orphanage, a nursery, and a health clinic, provides assistance to more than 200 underprivileged Kenyan and Sudanese children, ranging in age from three months to 17 years, with food, clothing, and shelter. With an emphasis on good nutrition, the orphanage makes many of its vegetarian meals using ingredients straight from the on-premise vegetable garden. With Africa’s widespread famine, there is no better time than now to help those who don’t have the means of helping themselves. Better Living Center
This vegetarian soup kitchen and clothing bank in Port Townsend, WA provides cruelty-free food to the local community every Tuesday and a “free store” with personal wares free-of-charge twice a week. Open to everyone but geared towards those unable to monetarily access food and clothing, Better Living welcomes donations from the public. This small-town charity makes a big difference for those in the area who are able to receive healthful food and clean clothing cost-free. Food For Life of New Orleans
Since 1969, this charity has been dedicated to providing food aid to disaster victims, the homeless, and the underprivileged in New Orleans, LA and rural southeastern Mississippi. Offering fresh, nutritious vegetarian and vegan meals, the organization travels door-to-door with mobile relief servers to bring hot meals (on wheels) to seniors, children, and homeless shelters, and has a large, modern facility equipped for large scale and efficient distribution of food to victims of disasters. Food For Life also aims to promote education, environmental health and sustainability, nutrition, and animal welfare. Food Not Bombs
While somewhat controversial for their anarchist roots, Food Not Bombs serves free vegan and vegetarian meals to thousands of hungry recipients in more than 1,000 cities worldwide. Striving to abolish the suffering of both people and animals by engaging within communities, the organization aims to make use of the immense amount of food that grocery stores and restaurants are unable to sell and thus obligated to dispose of. Local chapters rely on dedicated volunteers—consider starting a local chapter if one does not already exist in your neighborhood or city. If you can spare a few dollars, you can help the less fortunate enjoy a better quality of life this holiday season. Considering ditching the shopping sprees and spending your bucks on one of these "

In a recent piece in The New York Times, a foie gras defender said that the farmed ducks run up to be fed, implying that force-feeding the birds was not cruel. Shapiro argues that in reality, the ducks are running towards the workers because they know that they will be forcibly grabbed if they don’t. Shapiro also concludes that foie gras-industry promoters continue to “humane-wash” their claims, and that a greater call for reform will occur as more Americans learn about cruel factory-farming practices.

VEGANISM DISCRIMINATION SUIT,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/veganism-discrimination-suit,"NOVEMBER 10, 2011","A Ryerson University master’s student is consulting the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario to determine whether ethical veganism is considered a creed, which would grant it protection under anti-discrimination laws. The student, 37-year-old Sinem Ketenci, alleges that a senior professor pressured her supervisor into withdrawing his recommendation for her PhD candidacy based on a connection that she drew between abused animals and marginalized human populations. Ryerson’s School of Social Work argues that research projects within the discipline must be directly related to social work and not to animal rights. A three-year vegan, Ketenci states in her complaint that ethical veganism is similar to a religion in that it deals with moral imperatives and devotional practices, and is seeking $15,000 in compensation.

In the UK, one in five slaughtering facilities for cows, pigs, goats, and sheep already has video surveillance, in addition to just under 30 percent of poultry facilities. A paper that will be presented at next week’s FSA board meeting discusses the issue in detail, including the estimated installation costs of cameras as well as the welfare issues driving the proposal. Activist group Animal Aid drew widespread attention to the issue last fall when it released undercover footage depicting cruelty at seven different slaughterhouses in England. "

THANKFUL TURKEYS: MEET DALE,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/thankful-turkeys-meet-dale,"NOVEMBER 7, 2011","Two-year-old Dale lives the perfect turkey life: He spends his days with the love of his life, Daphne, soaking up the sun and noshing on his favorite foods—fresh blueberries, raisins, shredded lettuce, and diced apples. But life wasn’t always this easy for this handsome bird; In 2009, a little turkey with foot deformities hatched his way onto a farm that raises, slaughters, and prepares meat for pot pies and seasonal meals. Knowing the handicapped bird would never survive, a tender-hearted worker brought him home, only to realize that the bird was lonely. He returned the very next day to rescue a companion, now known as Dale, for the bird. The chicks rapidly grew large and were soon too big for the worker’s abode, so he delivered them to their current home: Maple Farm Sanctuary in Mendon, MA. Now, Dale plays the role of “ambassador,” as sanctuary staff calls him, welcoming visitors by strutting around with a magnificent feather display that rivals any peacock’s. Giving a whole new meaning to the term “love bird,” Dale’s world revolves around his mate Daphne, whom he met at MFS, and the two are inseparable. This guy will certainly be grateful this Thanksgiving for his daring rescue, which now allows him to live a fulfilling existence and show the world why these unique birds deserve compassion and an escape from dinner-plate destiny.

Two years later, a follow-up questionnaire showed that black participants who followed a vegan diet had a 70 percent reduced risk of developing diabetes, and vegetarians had a 53 percent reduced risk.

I’m so excited to spend this Thanksgiving with my mom, who just moved to Berkeley. We haven’t spent the holiday together since I was in college. When I told my mom we were going to have a vegetarian turkey, she laughed. It’ll be her first Tofurky, but I’m sure it won’t be her last.
Associate Editor Jennifer Chen Thanksgiving is the one holiday I look forward to all year long. For me, nothing beats the crisp fall air, sharing the entire day with my family, and eating amazing seasonal food. My Thanksgiving table will be filled with roasted butternut squash soup, garlic mashed potatoes, apple-sage stuffing (my mom now veganizes the dish we had growing up, and I can’t get enough!), my famous holiday salad (think greens, candied pecans, and dried cranberries), and spectacular vegan desserts, such as Dark Forest Trifle with Coconut Custard (found in the VegNews Holiday Cookbook). And if Thanksgiving couldn’t get any better, I leave for the VegNews Vegan Yoga Retreat in Mexico the very next day for a week of yoga, organic food, relaxing on the beach, and s’mores over a bonfire. I am grateful to be living a life that doesn’t harm animals, and have much to be thankful for.
Associate Publisher Colleen Holland While this will be the fourth Thanksgiving in a row that I won’t be able to be with my family, I’m fortunate to still have my boyfriend and close friends to celebrate with. I plan on making a yummy veggie pot pie, some garlicky mashed potatoes with sage gravy, and a pumpkin pie made with fresh pumpkin. It should be a delicious feast, and this marks one holiday closer to Christmas, when I will be able to see my family on the East Coast! 
Office Manager Lyndsay Orwig This Thanksgiving will be my second as the sole plant eater in a family of supremely awesome omnivores. I’m lucky to have a family who, instead of scoffing at my choices, asks me what kind of non-dairy milk I want on-hand—it’s almond milk, thanks Mom! This year will also be the first at the new Peraino headquarters in Golden, CO. In between trips down the ski slopes and hours spent watching football (Longhorns!), basketball (Blue Devils!) and hockey (Sharks!), I’ll whip up my answer to turkey—Kathy Patalsky’s Rustic Greenmarket Veggie Tofu Pot Pie. With a sweet potato-pepita crust and a creamy roux, what more could you ask for? Well, you could ask for huge cubes of cheesy baked tofu, which it also has. I created this culinary treat last year, and it was—pardon my French—ridiculement délicieux. And even better the second day—pot pie sandwich, you shall be mine.
Assistant Editor Anna Peraino My family is big on Thanksgiving—our annual celebration draws anywhere from 15 to 25 of my siblings’ friends, roommates, and cousins, in addition to my immediate family. Chaos and tomfoolery are embedded parts of our holiday tradition, and are necessary components to a successful run of the evening. Fortunately, the food is as plentiful as the anarchy. Since I was 16, every year I’ve whipped up Tofurky roast, vegan mushroom gravy, and vegan pumpkin pie—cruelty-free renditions of the conventional fare that my parents always cook. Last year, I even made a vegan pumpkin cheesecake and garlic mashed potatoes to boot—many omnivorous guests asked for seconds! Then we avoid Black Friday like the plague while we recover from the indulgent fun. 
Editorial Assistant Hilary Pollack This year, I’m going to be developing some new traditions for Thanksgiving, California style. While I usually spend my favorite holiday noshing on mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie with my family in New York, I can’t travel across the country this time around. Instead, my boyfriend Jeremy and I will be cooking up a feast for two (though it’ll likely turn out to be enough for 10), with amazing veggie dishes and the incorporation of fresh avocado—a California staple—whenever possible. While I’ll miss hanging out with my brother, sister, and dad, bashfully indulging in our annual revelations of what we’re most thankful for (usually each other), this year will prove to be as delicious as ever, and I’ll definitely be remixing my family favorites with some California flair, along with some post-feast board game competitions.

CAN YOU SPEND NOTHING FOR ONE DAY? HERE’S HOW,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/can-you-spend-nothing-for-one-day-heres-how,"NOVEMBER 6, 2011","It’s that time of year again—when people trample each other to death upon the release of a new gaming system. When the latest, cutest toy causes fistfights in the aisles of department stores across the country. When the prospect of being first to have it or having the most of it is primary. When the reality that this stuff actually requires trees to be chopped down, mountains to be blasted away, animals to be tortured and killed, and fellow people to endure the effects of the cheapest production possible is obscured by expensive campaigns telling us that we need it to be happy. When swarms of average moms and dads spend most of their savings on stuff they and their kids really don’t need to be happy or healthy, and when the few people at the tippy-top of this business model convince us that greed, observance of tradition, and loyalty to an insane economic system are written in our DNA. Thankfully, there is something incredibly powerful that you can do to help people, animals, and the environment this holiday season. It’s something so easy that you can do it in your sleep. But in order for it to be effective, you’ve got to get other people in on the action. What is this miracle, you ask? Easy! Buy nothing. The equation is easy to understand: if we want to survive on this planet for a while, we have got to consume less. Less oil, less metal, less paper, less stuff we don’t need. Less stuff that causes pollution. Less stuff that requires sweatshops. Less stuff that is just meaningless crap. The planet is not a stockpile of infinite resources, and the wrecking-ball of shopping that starts on the intolerable Black Friday and tears through forests, mountains, river-systems, and any animals or people in the way is only made worse by taking the overly-packaged junk we buy and adding one more unnecessary layer of wrapping. And ribbons. And bows. And cards. I mean, it all sure looks pretty under the tree, but seriously? Is this the spirit of giving that was intended by anyone but companies producing this stuff? This psychosis could only be justified if we lived in a world where products were not made from the very animals, trees, rocks, and liquids that hold ecosystems together, but instead, just materialized out of thin air. Poof! Like magic. And even though these hijacked holidays only come once a year, the toll that’s taken is devastating. Our demand for stuff is what turns trees into wrapping paper, mountaintops into soda cans, and animals into coats and shoes. This, my friends, is why I advocate a paramount celebration of Buy Nothing Day. It is an injection of sanity into the insane idea that forms the basis for our economic structure: that natural resources are infinite. It is one of the few times when doing nothing at all is one of the most powerful statements we can make. Sure, it may feel awkward at first to explain this to friends and family, but soon you’ll feel liberated, and you’ll have more money to spend on important things like bills and food. Buy Nothing Day doesn’t mean you can’t still give gifts and have a great time—it just means you should use your own craftiness, ingenuity, and resourcefulness to get some presents together without requiring vast amount of resource extraction, duh! For example, a few years ago I made my delicious Chocolate & Cinnamon Vegan Rugelach recipe for everyone. Make a plan. Tell your friends and family that this holiday you’d prefer not to exchange gifts, and instead, exchange words, a meal, a craft, an experience, or just friendship! It’s the easiest thing to not do. On Friday, November 25, sit back, relax, and buy nothing. Check out these other great recipes from Joshua:

ASK LAURA SAVES THANKSGIVING!,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/ask-laura-saves-thanksgiving,"NOVEMBER 2, 2011","Dear Laura,
I am hosting my first Thanksgiving for my in-laws, and it has to be good. Where do I start? I can cook, but I am no gourmet chef. How do I get my family excited about the all-vegan Thanksgiving I’m preparing?
—Anxious in Austin First, you’re super awesome for doing this, and I wish you were my in-law, because I’d eat the crap out of your vegan feast. That said, there’s no time to mess around, you need to impress these people or else they might hate you and your husband will divorce you and OMG, the pressure. First, you need to scour the internet looking for stellar, proven recipes. I recommend VegNews, VegWeb, Post Punk Kitchen, veganbaking.net, and the millions upon millions of vegan blogs. Once you’ve found some that have good reviews (This is key! Do not trust a recipe without reviews!), create a simple menu, and a game plan for executing it. If a recipe is complicated, either do a dry run first, or scrap it. Life’s too short to serve garbage food that stresses you out! Also, never be ashamed to see if local restaurants, natural food stores, or Whole Foods make vegan versions of holiday dishes: It can take some pressure off, and it’ll be guaranteed delicious, or else you can sue them. Or get your money back, one or the other. My final tips: Omnivores seem to be extra apprehensive about vegan meats, especially Tofurky, which has suffered from mainstream media’s ridicule since its creation. People are afraid of change! Because of this, perhaps you want to make less traditional main dishes, like an amazing lasagna or kick-ass casserole, and serve them with traditional sides that are easily veganized, like mashed potatoes and flaky biscuits. If you think about it, turkey isn’t really what most people look forward to on Thanksgiving anyway: it’s the sides. Oh, and the family hangout time, but we’re here to talk about things that really matter. Another important thing to keep in mind is to be enthusiastic about the food you serve. If you apologize for serving vegan food, other people will automatically think of it as “less than.” Let’s face it, people are followers, and if you’re like, “These vegan marshmallows are so awesome!” as you take a bite of your gooey, vegan marshmallow-topped sweet potatoes, rest assured others will follow suit. Happy Thanksgiving! "

Now in its 25th year, the Adopt-a-Turkey Project grants each donor a certificate with a color photo and fun details about their individual rescue turkey. This is the second year in a row that Ellen has been the spokesperson for the program, which has saved thousands of turkeys since 1986. Farm Sanctuary will also be holding a Celebration for the Turkeys later this month, wherein guests can feed turkeys their favorite Thanksgiving foods in person. "
VEGAN KNITTING FOR BEGINNERS,https://vegnews.com/2011/11/vegan-knitting-for-beginners,"NOVEMBER 1, 2011","Winter is coming—the brisk breeze and the bare trees say it all. It’s time to give up summer dresses and sandals in favor of heartier boots and snuggly sweaters. While winterwear is often woven with wool, cruelty-free options abound in the warm world of knits. Soft fibers made of wool alternatives are widely available and produce scarves, sweaters, and socks that are cute, comfortable, and cozy. Whether it’s DIY or purchased from skilled craftspeople, knits are a fun and fashionable way to keep warm, while maintaining compassion for animals. Knitting Knowledge
So, you’ve decided to go DIY when it comes to your vegan knitwear. Perfect! This is one of the easiest ways to ensure that your wardrobe remains cruelty-free, and it’s actually surprisingly easy. To get the basic technique, check out Vegan Knitting 101—VegNews TV correspondant Jasmin Singer will show you the ropes (or the yarn). Knitting pattern company Midnightsky Fibers has posted videos on YouTube demonstrating a variety of knitting techniques. Whether you want to create a pretty drop stitch scarf or learn how to make twisted stitch accents, there’s a video for you. With just a few hours of practice, you should be well on your way to expert knitting in no time. If you get stuck, consult friends who know their stuff; sometimes the easiest way to amp up your crafting skills is through one-on-one training sessions. Yarn And Fibers
Think yarn made from wool or alpaca is the easiest way to keep warm? Think again! Dozens of soft and smooth yarns made of alternative fibers are readily available to be woven into the knits of your dreams. One blog, aptly titled Fake Sheep, has created the tell-all guide to the best alternative fibers, like Peruvian cotton, crinkly linen, handspun hemp, banana silk, and bamboo blends, as well as where you can find them. Quo Vadis, a shop on Etsy, offers an amazing selection of vegan yarn, including hand-dyed versions in hues of coral, neon tangerine, lavender, and glacial lake blue. Additionally, most local yarn shops carry vegan yarn, though it may not be labeled as such. Avoid yarns made of wool, chitin, silk, and other animal-derived ingredients to build a compassionate knitwear collection. Knit a Community
With crafts like knitting, it’s all about community. Think sitting around a warm fire, knitting scarves, and discussing fun memories with your closest friends. To get more involved with the vegan knitting community, check out the blog Vegan Knitting, which reviews yarns and has how-to guides for hats, socks, and more. While not 100-percent vegan, Cast On podcast offers discussion on an array of topics, with compelling episode titles like “Deny the Knit,” “Knitting Renaissance,” and “Knitting Mash Up.” Or, if vegan socks have stolen your heart, consider becoming a member of the blog Vegan Sock Kal, where you and all your vegan sock aficionado friends can post photos of your passion. Show Me The Sweater!
OK, so maybe you don’t have time to twist yarn knots out for hours on end to make a beautiful hand-crafted wear. After all, any experienced knitter will tell you about projects that frustrated them, especially as amateurs. While the craft gets easier with time, sometimes you just need cute scarves and sweaters before spring rolls around. Enter Treewool—an online storefront chockfull of adorable knitted crop tops, hats, vests, and headbands. San Francisco-based knitter Kristen Blackmore uses only cruelty-free materials to create Treewool’s handmade clothing line, so customers know they’re getting high quality, compassionate clothes. Etsy seller Murano & Tagua also creates colorful knitted scarves with chunky stripes for kids and adults, using a medley of vegan-friendly materials. The store has every vegan-friendly item labeled as such, so just check the descriptions. For international treasures, Birgit Blau’s vegan line, though limited, includes knitted gems like bubblegum pink scarves and fire engine red mittens, perfect for winter. Whether you’re ambitious enough to knit a thick, cozy scarf or you’re opting for compassionate designs from skilled craftspeople, cruelty-free knitwear will keep you warm for many winters to come. All it takes is some yarn, a couple needles, and a bit of time and patience. "

This month, the activists—Karry Hedberg, a vegan chef, and Saila Kivelä, a political science student—are being charged with 10 counts of disturbing the peace and 12 counts of aggravated defamation. However, Hedberg tells Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, “At no stage did we ever suggest that the activities carried out at the pig farms were illegal. On the contrary: We wanted to show that this sort of operation is legal in Finland, despite the fact that it upsets many people.” "

Despite Hildy’s permanent beak and toe disfigurements from her cruel origins, this friendly girl now spends her days running up to the gate to greet visitors and staying warm in the sun. She loves attention from people and will sit with visitors and staff for hours. Her Thanksgiving meal will consist of her favorite food—cooked yams—during Farm Sanctuary’s annual Celebration of the Turkeys on November 21. As one of the oldest birds at the sanctuary, this eight-year-old is youthful as ever and has even been caught rounding up the other birds to sneak up on unsuspecting pigs. She is beloved by staff and called a “peacemaker,” using her 30 unique vocal sounds to communicate with the other birds and make friends with animals and humans alike. More Thankful Turkeys:

William J. Fielding, PhD, director of planning at the College of the Bahamas, studied responses from 1,500 participants over 18 months and presented his findings at a symposium last week. Fielding found that domestic violence and the presence of a gun within a household correlated with children having a higher risk of exhibiting abuse towards animals. Additionally, the study revealed that as people age, most tend to show remorse for their cruelty, but those who did not were more likely to exhibit criminal behavior. This finding is consistent with the proven link between empathy toward animals and empathy toward other humans. "

From the obscure to the absurd, there’s a reason to rejoice almost every day, so amp up your holiday season this year. To kick off November, it’s Peanut Butter Lovers’ Month! Get started with a Grilled Peanut Butter and Jelly washed down with a Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie Milkshake and finished off with Peanut Butter Pie for dessert. Can’t handle it? Luckily, you have an entire month to celebrate. National Deviled Eggs Day
November 2
You might be thinking that this holiday does not sound very vegan-friendly, but vegan deviled eggs are a tasty reality. There are several formidable substitutes for the expected hard-boiled egg that usually serves as the vehicle for the smooth-and-smoky, paprika-speckled filling. In the recipe for Potato Angels, new potatoes baked to soft perfection deliver a spicy scoop of mustard and vegan mayo, or try Vegan Crunk’s Tofu Deviled “Eggy” Bites, which swap the eggs with charming tofu squares.  National Sandwich Day
November 3
Hot on the heels of National Deviled Eggs Day, this sandwichpalooza is guaranteed to brighten the first Thursday of the month. The possibilities for celebratory lunches are literally endless—go big or go home with a Reuben Sandwich with Russian Dressing, keep it simple with a Grilled Avocado and Tomato Sandwich, or conjure the flavors of the east with homemade Bánh Mi. And don’t forget to check out our seven favorites from around the country! Bittersweet Chocolate With Almonds Day
November 3
No, we did not invent this holiday for our own greedy benefit, but we wish we had. Get crafty by trying Fine Cooking’s recipe for Bittersweet Chocolate Bark with Marcona Almonds—just try not to eat the whole batch in one sitting. For the store-bought route, hook yourself up with one of Chocolate Decadence’s Organic Chocolate Almond Bars and pat yourself on the back for being so festive. National Pizza With the Works Except Anchovies Day
November 12
Fire up your oven and prepare for melted magic on National Pizza With the Works Except Anchovies Day (which wins the award for longest holiday title of the month). We’re glad that this festival is fishless, so we can load up our pies with all the faux meats, grilled veggies, and dairy-free cheese that we can find. Feeling culinarily ambitious? Make your very own Deep Dish Pizza, or even go Stuffed Crust. For a green and cheeseless twist on the treat, try Hella Veggies Pesto Pizza. The sky’s the limit as long as you take “the works” to the next level. Clean Out Your Refrigerator Day
November 15
Does a threatening stench waft from the recesses of your refrigerator every time you open its door? Do you find yourself struggling to ignore the black mold that is starting to grow teeth and hair behind the six month-old condiments in the back? It’s that special day to throw on some gloves and go to town on your icebox. When it sparkles and smells fresh as a daisy, you’ll breathe a major sigh of relief. Plus, you’ll make room for all of those Thanksgiving leftovers. America Recycles Day
November 15
Conveniently, the very same day that you should suck it up and clean out your fridge is also the day to remember to recycle, reduce, and reuse. Roughly 900 people have already pledged to use this holiday as a chance to learn about and act on their recycling habits on its official website. But, of course, try to make every day a recycling day. Homemade Bread Day
November 17
Mmm … carbs. Fresh, homemade bread spread with nut butter or jam is the perfect way to start your morning or enhance your afternoon tea time. Breadmaking doesn’t have to feel like a science project—there are lots of easy ways to make luscious loaves. Bake up raisin-studded Irish Soda Bread, easy yeast-free Yummy Avocado Bread, or sweet Super Duper Moist Banana Bread in honor of this special day. Absurdity Day
November 20
Tango with your dog, wear a fake mustache, or paint your house plaid. Write a conceptual poem about tennis or sew a pillowcase out of tortillas and dental floss. It’s absurdity day. Go to town. National Cashew Day
November 23
The 23rd of November is also Eat a Cranberry Day, but there are enough cranberries in November as it is. It’s time to praise a nut that has gone above and beyond for vegans over the years: the noble cashew. Whether in gourmet dairy-free cheeses or life-changingly delicious ice creams, the cashew takes many forms, all of them scrumptious. Celebrate with a handful of plain ones or your personal favorite recipe that incorporates this nutritious, delicious nut. National Parfait Day
November 25
If you have any room whatsoever left in your gullet after gorging all day on your Thanksgiving feast, pack away a parfait for the sake of this unique holiday. For a seasonal rendition, try Super Easy Pumpkin Ginger Parfaits, complete with crushed gingersnaps and candied ginger. Erring on the side of healthy? Strawberry Avocado Parfait awaits, a sweet reminder of the tastes of summer. Buy Nothing Day
November 25
Shop ahead of time for your parfait extravaganza, because November 25th—in addition to being Black Friday—is also Buy Nothing Day. While the masses are out swarming around deals on flat-screen TVs and discounted DVDs, have a shut-in, spending-free day to signify that the best things in life are free. Well, besides parfaits.  "
MAINSTREAM MAGS GO VEG FOR THE HOLIDAYS,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/mainstream-mags-go-veg-for-the-holidays,"OCTOBER 30, 2011","Popular food and lifestyle magazines and news outlets are catching on to vegan dining in a major way this fall. From raw cuisine to veg Thanksgiving dishes, meat-free eating is getting major exposure in outlets that reach millions across the country. Here are a few of this season’s articles and recipes that caught our eye for their compassionate qualities. A Sign of the (NY) Times
With more than 30 million unique visitors each month, The New York Times website spreads the word in a major way. That’s why we were so excited to see it ask readers to share their favorite veg dish for entertaining, as well as provide a full vegetarian menu from columnist Melissa Clark. Nearly every single dish is entirely vegan, save for a touch of easily subbed-out butter. Farro and Fresh Tomato Soup with Basil? A Harvest Tart with Pumpkin, Roasted Red Peppers, and Olives? Hummus with Crisp Maitake Mushrooms? Yes, yes, and yes. This meatless menu is surely going in our personal recipe binders. The Times also offers a slideshow with 29 recipes and tantalizing photos of veg appetizers, entrées, and side dishes, including veg sushi, Raw Butternut Squash Salad with Raisins and Ginger, and Carrot and Tahini soup with Pita Crisps, all cruelty-free. Savvy Sunset
We’re charmed by Sunset’s recent and thorough foray into vegan cuisine. Offering plant-based recipes in its past three consecutive print issues, this lifestyle mag is bringing smiles to our faces and rumbles to our bellies. In its September issue, we spotted vegan recipes for Black Pepper Tofu and Green Beans, Indian Spice-Stuffed Okra, and “Broccamole” (Yes, guacamole made with broccoli. We are totally on board). In October, we lusted for Cashew, Coconut, and Pumpkin Curry (and they even used the word “vegan”!) and Fall Green Salad with Apples, Nuts, and Pain d’Epice Dressing. And November’s edition brings ravenous readers a full spread of mouthwatering vegan side dishes, like Mashed Potatoes and Parsnips with Crisp Root Vegetable Strips and Brussels Sprouts-Wheatberry Slaw with Smoked Paprika Dressing. And don’t miss the Vegan Chocolate Strawberry Shortcake Cupcakes on their recipes website, courtesy of VN contributor and chef extraordinaire Chloe Coscarelli. Subscription renewed. Ship Shape
Fitness and health magazine Shape is on the pulse of plant-based eating. Between nominating two vegan blogs (FatFree Vegan Kitchen and Diet, Dessert, and Dogs) for its 2011 Best Blogger Awards and posting a feature on Six Easy Raw Food Recipes to Try (including a delectable raw brownie), Shape is in touch with the many benefits of feasting on fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole foods. They’ve also featured vegan blogger Jessica Olson’s tips on quick and easy meals, as well as a feature on vegan celebrities. The Veg Edge
Vegan-related content has sprouted in a host of other mainstream publications above and beyond the aforementioned. The Wall Street Journal published an article in October about vegan bakeries and restaurants that win approval from customers without using the “v” word, demonstrating that meat- and dairy-free food is just as tasty and satisfying as its animal product-laden counterparts. In September, Women’s Health got down with Meatless Monday in an “Easy Vegan” feature with Apple Pancakes, California Veggie Burgers, and Garbanzo Quinoa Salad, among other tasty-sounding dishes. Whole Living’s vegan recipe photo gallery had us at “Banana, Coconut, and Cashew-Cream Tart,” (and hello to you!) but every dish in the gallery looks amazing. Sweet Potato Hummus? Sign us up. Key Issues
Whole Living’s cruelty-free foods slideshow blew our minds and tickled our tastebuds, and check out their November print issue for stunning images of vegan foods that you can tape on your wall like teen heartthrobs. A gorgeous spread of Creamy White Bean and Vegetable Mash, Green Bean and Shallot Ravioli Salad, and Stuffed Acorn Squash with Quinoa and Pistachios (among other dishes) makes us want to feast on sides, sides, and only sides. These plant-based remixes using traditional Thanksgiving vegetables and seasonings would make worthy additions to any holiday table, and the piece is worth a peek for the photographs alone, which are beautifully detailed, visceral, and enchanting. This month’s issue of Every Day with Rachael Ray also summons veg readers with the almighty kale, named November’s “seasonal superfood.” We’re dying to try the mag’s Lemon-Pepper Kale Chips, and it even offers an easy recipe for green juice, made from fresh kale, apple, celery, lemon, and parsley. This holiday season, veganism is making waves in major media. Log on or pick up one of these popular publications for innovative recipes, insightful commentary, and photos worth feasting on—and don’t forget to write a letter to the editor letting them know how much you appreciate increased coverage of veganism!

No Trick Treats! website has just the answer for you. The Halloween site is creating a database of all the houses, apartments, and businesses that have agreed to give out candy safe for those with restricted diets this Halloween, for the second year in a row.

Dozens of houses nationwide have already signed up, and the website is still accepting listings for those interested in participating. Trick-or-treaters can also print a map to take with them this Halloween. "
BOSTON VEG FEST,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/boston-veg-fest,"OCTOBER 28, 2011","Celebrate the cruelty-free lifestyle on the East Coast this weekend at the 16th annual Boston Vegetarian Food Festival. The two-day event takes place at the Reggie Lewis Athletic Center and will bring an array of natural foods vendors, chefs, and educators together. Participating speakers include Dr. Michael Greger, Eat Vegan on $4 a Day’s author Ellen Jaffe Jones, and Our Hen House’s Jasmin Singer and Mariann Sullivan. Roughly 120 exhibitors are also attending, offering food samples and product demonstrations all weekend long. The event, sponsored by the Boston Vegetarian Society, is free and open to the public. "
ANIMAL TESTING DOWN,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/animal-testing-down,"OCTOBER 27, 2011","Major reforms in animal testing are underway in the Netherlands this month. While testing on primates closely related to humans was banned in 2003, major Dutch research firm TNO has recently said it will immediately stop testing on all primates. Additionally, a proposed ban on testing products on cats and dogs received enough support to be represented in Parliament. This ban was ultimately rejected on procedural grounds but is predicted to pass in future hearings due to immense citizen support. These bans represent a trend in use of alternative measures for testing, which are often less expensive and save the lives of countless animals. In 2009, the Netherlands had reduced the number of animals tested by more than half since 30 years ago. "
KATY PERRY BENEFITS ASPCA,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/katy-perry-benefits-aspca,"OCTOBER 27, 2011","Singer Katy Perry has requested that fans donate to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on behalf of her 27th birthday this week. On Perry’s page for the ASPCA, people can donate $50, $100, $250, $500, or a write-in amount to the animal-welfare organization, in order to “make a lot more kittens (and other animals) happy in this world,” Perry writes. The singer, best known for her hits “Teenage Dream” and “Fireworks,” had an all-vegetarian concert rider for her 2011 tour, and her husband, actor Russell Brand, announced his conversion to veganism earlier this week. "
CINNAMON SNAIL HITS NYC,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/cinnamon-snail-hits-nyc,"OCTOBER 27, 2011","New Jersey-based vegan food truck The Cinnamon Snail has announced that it will begin servicing the Big Apple starting next month. The Cinnamon Snail offers organic, cruelty-free treats such as white chocolate-glazed pumpkin twists, red curry grilled tofu banh mi sandwiches, and raw pizza. Chef Adam Sobel tells culture website Gothamist that beginning in mid-November, the truck will be serving Manhattan and Brooklyn four to five days a week, remaining in New Jersey on the remaining days. It took nearly two years for the truck to acquire the proper licenses to operate within the city. "
TRAFFIC JAM: THE WEEK ENDING OCTOBER 28,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/traffic-jam-the-week-ending-october-28,"OCTOBER 27, 2011","1. Need a last-minute Halloween costume? Time has you covered with some simple (and timely!) getups. Other staff favorites: Facebook (hot-glue a book to a headband, be hilarious) and Ceiling Fan (cheerleader outfit, pom poms, shirt that says “Go Ceilings!”) 2. “What’s Dutch Crunch?”—VN Editorial Assistant Joni Sweet; “It’s what you want.”—VN Office Manager Lyndsay Orwig, while discussing bread options at Ike’s Place in SF. The vegan-friendly sandwich shop gave away free grub, and, needless to say, we capitalized. 3. These radioactivity-detecting plates are awesome, but the photos make us happy we stick to veggie sushi. 4. The 16 recipes from this vegan Halloween candy roundup are spook-a-licious. Candy corn, Butterfingers, and Twix? We’ll take five dozen of each now. Great, thanks. 5.

Favorite Column: Veganize It! (Allison Rivers Samson)
What You Love Most About VegNews: VegNews Magazine
Favorite Blog: Café VegNews Editor Picks Person of the Year: Kathy Freston
This author and activist had quite a year. Her book’s a best-seller, her Twitter account and Huffington Post blog posts are active and educational, Vanity Fair writer John Helipern committed to going veg after just one lunch with her, and she appeared not only on The Oprah Winfrey Show, but helped a family adopt a vegan diet on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, chatted veganism on The Martha Stewart Show with fellow activists Biz Stone and Gene Baur, and talked shop on Charlie Rose. Restaurant of the Year: Native Foods Café
With 17 years in business, 12 thriving locations (with dozens more in development), and 2 million meals served in 2011 alone, Native Foods Café, has gone from vegan eatery to national dining sensation. What makes Native Foods Café unique? Everything is made from scratch (including seven types of seitan), nothing on the menu is more than $10, and each location is customized to its neighborhood. Our hat goes off to this venerable institution for not only perfecting vegan cuisine, but also taking it to the masses unlike any other. Company of the Year: BabyCakes
In 2011, our hat goes off to BabyCakes, the venerable gluten-free, vegan bakery that got its start just six years ago in New York City’s Lower East Side. Fast forward to today, and Erin McKenna’s flourishing empire has outposts in four locations, two cookbooks, a brilliant online presence, and a cult-like following that can’t get enough of the bakery’s agave-sweetened brownies and spelt red velvet cupcakes. We can’t wait to see what it does next. Product of the Year: Earth Balance Organic Coconut Spread
Can we even imagine a life before 1998 when GFA Brands introduced Earth Balance and changed the course of vegan baked goods forever? We’d rather not. So our beating (cholesterol-free) hearts were stilled when we experienced the company’s newest addition—Organic Coconut Spread—at Natural Products Expo West. Rich and decadent with a slight coconut flavor, this condiment deliciously tops everything from French toast to baked potatoes. Book of the Year: Whitewash
Joseph Keon’s Whitewash: The Disturbing Truth About Cow’s Milk and Your Health is “the best book written on the subject” according to none other than John Robbins, who knows a thing or two about the dairy industry. Keon’s doctorate in nutrition gives Whitewash indisputable credibility, while the thoroughness of research should be irrefutable evidence to anyone not making milk mustache ads or on the payroll of the National Dairy Council to get off the bovine beverage. Cookbook of the Year: The Candle 79 Cookbook
There are no two ways about it: The Candle 79 Cookbook is stunning. Reading through the book feels like settling into one of the restaurant’s comfortable booths, as the warmth and hospitality of its authors ooze out. Co-authored by Co-owner Joy Pierson, Executive Chef Angel Ramos, and Pastry Chef Jorge Pineda, the cookbook bursts with all of Candle 79’s signature recipes. Yes, the Chimichurri Seitan, Seitan Piccata, and Spaghetti and Wheat Balls are all there, just waiting to be made. Movie of the Year: Forks Over Knives
It might be sacrilegious to mention evangelist Jim Bakker and Real Time’s Bill Maher in the same sentence, but both are true believers of Forks Over Knives. The film follows writer/director Lee Fulkerson and others on a journey to health through a plant-based diet, inspired by the lifetime works of T. Colin Campbell and Caldwell Esselstyn. A companion book made The New York Times best-seller list, the DVD is now available for purchase and digital streaming, and more videos are in the works. Nonprofit of the Year: Mercy for Animals
Since being named VegNews’ Nonprofit of the Year in 2006, Mercy for Animals has done nothing but explode, fast-tracking a vision of animal protection’s promising future to the present. In 2011 alone, MFA opened a new office; released undercover video which garnered widespread media coverage; released the DVD Farm to Fridge; hosted spectacular events; erected pro-veg billboards and staged vegan “feed-ins” nationwide; and strengthened coalitions to ban farmed-animal cruelty. All from an organization with 70,000 supporters and an annual budget of just $1.5 million. Vegan Lovefest
What do you get when you bring together 250 vegan bloggers in what may be the world’s most vegan friendly city? A 24/7 vegan lovefest you have to experience to believe—and the first-ever Vida Vegan Blogger Conference. The event was packed with panel discussions, workshops, cooking demos, buffet breakfasts, a cocktail hour, food outings, a film screening, and a dress-up gala. See what we mean about one big party? Indie Media Powerhouse
What happens when talent combines with passionate activism? Our Hen House. Jasmin Singer and Mariann Sullivan, the unstoppable duo behind the online media hub and self- described “wannabe pundits,” cover every aspect of the vegan lifestyle, from blog posts about the latest research on nutrition to profiles of artists who incorporate vegan themes into their work, as well as podcasts featuring activists of every possible stripe and dazzling videos of interviews and events. Here at VegNews, we’re huge fans. Mainstream Men
This year, mainstream writers Mark Bittman (The New York Times), B.R. Myers (The Atlantic), Grant Butler (The Oregonian), and Bryan Walsh (time.com) filled paper and web pages with inspections of factory farming, support for increased food safety, cutting critiques of the nation’s foodie phenomena, the Humane Society of the United States and United Egg Producers’ historic hen-standards agreement, and much more. We think Time said it best when they tweeted, “Vegans have a point. Sorry, meat eaters.” Queso Loco
Anyone who’s interested in being a nacho, nacho man (or woman) can now choose from among outrageously good options like Nacho Mom’s, Food for Lovers, Nacheez, or Teese. VN Editor-at-Large Laura Hooper Beck raved on vegansaurus.com about Food for Lovers’ vegan queso, saying, “It is a miracle of food science! We live in a truly blessed time, fellow vegans.” We couldn’t agree more. Silver Anniversary Award
For a quarter-century, Farm Sanctuary has been rehabilitating animals who live out their lives on farms in New York and California and served as ambassadors for the more than 10 billion land animals slaughtered annually for food in the US alone. Now led by Co-founder Gene Baur and National Shelter Director Susie Coston, Farm Sanctuary has grown from its humble beginnings with the rescue of a lone sheep into an $8 million organization with more than 250,000 supporters and 900 animals. Kudos on 25 years. Caramel Craze
Caramel has officially hit the milk-free masses. Let us count the ways: salted vanilla caramels from Allison’s Gourmet, caramel pecan turtles from Obsessive Confection Disorder (we can relate), espresso coconut caramels from JJ’s Sweets, caramel agave dipping nectar from The Real Food Trading Company (just try not to eat this by the spoonful), and chocolate caramel candy bars from Sjaak’s. We’re not sure what kicked off this revolutionary food trend, but we couldn’t be happier. Failure of the Year
In 2011, four states (Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, and New York) attempted to make it illegal to film undercover footage on farms, and the quadruplet is now in the legislative graveyard. The bills were considered an attempt by powerful agricultural interest groups and their friends to protect the industry, and opponents say the work of undercover investigators is essential, as it leads to stricter animal-protection laws and is a form of whistle blowing that should be protected. The Fun Funding Award
Without the crowd-funding platform Kickstarter, we wouldn’t have three vegan food trucks, two documentaries, a handful of bakeries, and a vegan podcast. This year, more than 15 vegan music, film, art, publishing, and food projects turned to Kickstarter to fund their vegan businesses. And as consumers and supporters of these projects, the public is able to vote with their dollar and dictate what we see, eat, and read with their donations, which might be the best news of all. The Roll of the Dice Award
Ryan Henn believes that vegan men face a lot of unique challenges, as they are stereotypically expected to conform to an image of the meat-eating muscle-head in order to be considered masculine. So, as any activist would, Henn got to work dispelling the myth of men and meat by creating Vegans in Vegas: Bachelor Party 2011. Held in the increasingly veg-friendly Sin City, home of hotel magnate (and vegan) Steve Wynn, the event featured lectures, vegan meals, poker lessons, and more. Shop Explosion
Cruelty-free shopping has never been easier, thanks to a new crop of vegan shops opening up online and in a town near you. Three entirely vegan grocery stores—Vegan Freak in Denton, TX; Vegilicious in Dortmund, Germany; and Viva La Vegan in Rancho Cucamonga, CA. In addition to the 100-percent vegan grocery store trio, other vegan shops opened up from coast to coast (not to mention online): Cookbook author Sarah Kramer’s Sarah’s Place in Victoria, BC; Brave GentleMan, Joshua Katcher’s shop for dapper vegan gents; Brooklyn’s pop-up Vegan Shop Up; and Vegan Beauty Market all make it easy to shop cruelty-free. The “It” Vegetable
Kale was everywhere in 2011—magazines, television shows, blogs, and celebrities could not get enough of the green stuff. Who loves this leafy vegetable? Actress Portia de Rossi, Al Roker, Men’s Fitness, Real Simple, Every Day with Rachael Ray, and New York magazine, for a start. Packed with vitamins, potassium, iron, and fiber, and low in calories, this trendy veggie can be made into salads, chips, pesto, wraps, smoothies, and more. Here at VegNews, we can’t get enough. Totally Tubular
Vegans took over the boob tube this year, appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Martha Stewart Show, The Dr. Oz Show, and many more. Former President Bill Clinton talked to CNN about his mostly plant-based diet; Seattle-based Mighty-O Donuts was crowned Food Network’s Donut Champion; Sticky Fingers Bakery appeared on Cupcake Wars twice; vegan food truck Seabirds competed on The Great Food Truck Race; Ayinde Howell popped up on Bravo’s Rocco’s Dinner Party; and Isa Chandra Moskowitz took travelers through Portland on The Cooking Channel. And in October, an entirely vegan cooking show The Jazzy Vegetarian debuted on public television. Get that DVR ready.

ELLEN OPENING VEGAN RESTAURANT,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/ellen-opening-vegan-restaurant,"OCTOBER 26, 2011","Diners in Studio City, CA can look forward to the opening of a new vegan restaurant from some of the cruelty-free lifestyle’s biggest heavy hitters. Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Chrissie Hynde, and Hollywood producer and philanthropist Steve Bing have partnered with Chefs Tal Ronnen and Scot Jones (former executive chef of Hynde’s recently closed Ohio restaurant, VegiTerranean) to open the currently unnamed venture. Says Ronnen, ”It goes without saying how amazing it is to to have Chrissie, Ellen, Portia, and Steve involved. I’m excited to be working with Chef Scot Jones on the project. It will be great to work with him again on a spot closer to home.” The opening date has not yet been set. "
OZZY OSBOURNE GOES VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/ozzy-osbourne-goes-vegan,"OCTOBER 26, 2011","The Prince of Darkness, Ozzy Osbourne, has announced that he’s trying a vegan diet. He revealed his decision to cut meat and dairy from his meals on The Talk, a TV show co-hosted by his wife Sharon, on Tuesday. The 62-year-old says he was inspired by the documentary Forks Over Knives, the same film that inspired actor Russell Brand to adopt a vegan diet. Osbourne believes the diet will improve his health and says, “I feel better about myself, you know? That‘s the reason why I decided to cut out meat out and dairy because … when you‘re on the road and you’re traveling, you grab buns and … burgers are everywhere … so now I’ve just narrowed the margin.” Photo from noisecreep.com & Leigh Voigel/FilmMagic "
FRANCE REQUIRES MEAT AT SCHOOL,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/france-requires-meat-at-school,"OCTOBER 26, 2011","Earlier this month, the French government passed a new law mandating that all meals served at schools include fish, dairy, meat, or offal as a means of providing protein and calcium. While the new rules do not explicitly ban meals without meat, French vegetarian group L214 says that the law sources all protein included in meals from animal products. The European Vegetarian Union says that this law essentially bans vegetarianism for a large portion of the French population and violates the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, as outlined by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. "
SCIENTISTS DEVELOP “SUPER BROCCOLI”,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/scientists-develop-super-broccoli,"OCTOBER 26, 2011","A team of scientists at the Institute for Food Research in England has developed a new type of broccoli rich in nutrients that can prevent heart disease. While traditional broccoli is high in nutrients, including vitamin C, fiber, and beta-carotene, the new strain also has two to three times the amount of glucoraphanin, which is believed to have cancer- and heart disease-fighting properties. Now sold under the name Beneforte, the new broccoli took 14 years to develop and will be sold across the US starting this fall. The broccoli has already hit shelves in Britain, where it is sold as part of a line that also includes mushrooms, tomatoes, and potatoes with added vitamins. "
NEW ONLINE VEGAN MAGAZINE LAUNCHES,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/new-online-vegan-magazine-launches,"OCTOBER 25, 2011","Nothing compares to the sensation of opening a new magazine for the first time—the smell of the fresh ink, the smooth, glossy pages between your fingers, the bright photos of amazing people doing incredible things—but most people have never considered starting their own. Cara Livermore and Bob Lawton are the exception—after starting their vegan blog Hipster Food roughly one year ago, they decided to take things to the next level with Chickpea magazine, the duo’s newest venture. In it, you’ll find food photos so enticing you can practically taste them, recipes so simple you’ll wonder why you never tried making vegan Nutella before, and stories so deeply personal you’ll seamlessly reconnect with your own compassionate choices. The magazine is currently only available in digital format, but they plan to print a limited number early next year. Hailing from Rochester, NY, Livermore and Lawton connected with VegNews on their transition from casual bloggers to do-it-all magazine publishers, and what their recently successful Kickstarter campaign will mean for Chickpea. VN: What was the process of starting Chickpea like?
Cara Livermore: We were looking through all these great online magazines and none of them were vegan. We really wanted to veganize [our own] and bring together all of our friends and fellow vegan bloggers in the process to create a more tightly knit community. First, we put the call out there for anybody to submit. We looked through all the submissions and chose [some], then people got back to us with full articles, and we worked with them to refine them. We also did some photoshoots ourselves and edited everything together. From start to finish, it took us two months, [with a] week to photograph, edit, and test the recipes. VN: What is the mission of Chickpea?
Bob Lawton: Basically to get a whole range of views from the vegan food-blogging community, as much as on Tumblr, as on Etsy, as on anywhere on the internet that we can get in touch with, and to put that all in one place. This isn’t a magazine that has advertising or anything else backing it up—it’s going to be completely supported by whoever buys a subscription and whoever decides to support us.
CL: The first [part of the mission is] giving vegans voices and bringing that community together. The second is getting people to cook more for themselves, so we provide lots of recipes and [offer] a more realistic point of view of what veganism is. I think we do that through the stories and recipes, making it sort of a mix between a [magazine] and a cookbook. VN: Where did you get inspiration for Chickpea’s style?
CL: Mostly just from other online magazines—we found ethereal, minimalist magazines that I thought were pretty cool compared to a lot of mainstream magazines. The number one magazine that we loved was Kinfolk. They get people to set up big production-style photoshoots, and it’s nearly twice as long as ours. There’s some really great stuff in there, so that’s what want to aspire to. VN: How have readers responded so far?
CL: We’ve gotten a lot of positive response and a lot of comments on the magazine site and our blog. A lot of people really think it’s top-notch, and we’ve already gotten a ton of submissions for our next issue. We already have more submissions this time than what we had total last time. We’ve gotten some offers, as well—Etsy shops are offering to send us products and cookbooks for review, which we weren’t expecting. VN: How does it feel to have gained so much support from donors on Kickstarter?
CL: It’s exciting that so many people in the vegan community liked what we did, but at the same time a little daunting that our little project is going to be so exposed. This will certainly make launching our print run a million times easier and give us the capital to do things like applying for periodical shipping rates and printing extra copies to sell at craft shows. All in all it’s wonderful! VN: How do you think Chickpea will impact the vegan movement?
BL: A lot of our articles are either people talking about how they became vegan or how to become a better vegan, so [it offers] personal perspectives on that. One of our articles is about a girl who moves from being bulimic and anorexic to being vegan to actually eating a healthy diet. It actually outlines the distinction between veganism, unhealthy eating, and getting a handle on what you’re putting into your body. [There are some] pretty inspirational stories about how people have come to veganism from pretty unhealthy places. Bob and Cara’s Five-Step Guide to Creating Your Own ‘Zine
1. Come up with a really good idea that people will latch on to.
2. Attract contributors. You can start out with friends and contacts, but make sure they’re as enthusiastic about the project as you are.
3. Develop relevant content. Take great photographs and write articles that will appeal to people.
4. Edit, edit, edit. Get to the core of every story before going to press.
5. Promote. You can get your contributors to do some promotion, as well as the backers of your personal projects. That said, simply having a high-quality product will generate a level of buzz. "
MFA VEG CAMPAIGN HITS MTV,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/mfa-veg-campaign-hits-mtv,"OCTOBER 25, 2011","Animal-welfare group Mercy For Animals has debuted a new campaign, geared at showing young people the benefits of vegetarianism and the cruelty of factory farming. The powerful new commercials, which will air on MTV and other cable channels, feature imagery and videos from MFA’s undercover investigations, revealing the horrors that animals endure before ending up on dinner plates. In one, a woman ordering a cheeseburger at a fast-food restaurant sees blood gushing from the bag and a flash of animals crammed in filthy cages; in another, blood drips from a high-school student’s tray as he grabs chicken nuggets in the lunch line. "
HORSE SLAUGHTER CONTINUES,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/horse-slaughter-continues,"OCTOBER 25, 2011","A new report issued by the US Government Accountability Office says that roughly the same number of horses from the US are still being slaughtered for human and animal consumption as in 2006. Because the last domestic horse slaughtering plant closed roughly five years ago, the horses now must be exported on long, cruel journeys to slaughterhouses, indicating an overall decline in their welfare. Last year, nearly 138,000 horses were shipped from the US to Mexico and Canada for slaughter. The GAO’s report says that many veterinarians have reported an increase in abuse and neglect cases since the cessation of domestic slaughter. The report suggests that Congress should reconsider appropriating funds to ensure horse welfare. "
FORMER TAIWAN VP URGES VEG DIET,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/former-taiwan-vp-urges-veg-diet,"OCTOBER 25, 2011","Former Taiwanese Vice President Annette Lu has gone veg—and she wants the public to do the same. At a green festival in Taipei on Sunday, Lu performed a veg cooking demo, whipping up a recipe of bitter gourd with king oyster mushrooms, while urging citizens to have at least one vegetarian meal per day. The politician also argued that decreasing the consumption of animal products is the “most effective” method of taking action toward achieving sustainability, stating, “If everyone were to quit eating meat for one day, it would generate the same benefit as planting 200 to 300 trees.” Lu has been vegetarian for more than four months and says that she feels healthier and looks younger since changing her diet.

Furthermore, the US Department of Agriculture’s nutritional guidelines also say people who meet certain criteria (more than 47 percent of the population), such as those over the age of 51 or those suffering from specific health conditions, should reduce their sodium intake to 1,500 milligrams, in order to reduce the risk of diseases like hypertension, heart disease, and stroke.

Singh, who began running 20 years ago at the age of 81, tells The Times of India that his healthy plant-based diet is what kept him moving. “You need a balanced and wholesome diet.

Similar to Energy Star ratings, which identify energy-efficient appliances, the new labeling system would graphically depict calorie counts by serving size and use a point system to identify the amounts of saturated and trans fats, sodium, and sugars. The report says, “It is time for a move away from front-of-package systems that mostly provide nutrition information on foods or beverages, but don’t give clear guidance about their healthfulness, and toward one that encourages healthier choices through simplicity, visual clarity, and the ability to convey meaning without written information.” "

VEGAN FOOD AND BEER TO FALL FOR,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/vegan-food-and-beer-to-fall-for,"OCTOBER 23, 2011","As the frequency of blustery days increases, the craving for warm, belly-filling foods—as well as alcoholic accompaniments—begins to beckon. Here are six of our favorite mouthwatering fall meals, paired with libations that elevate them to gastronomic bliss. Super Soup
In the autumn months, soups and stews shine as simple yet hearty dinners that are big on flavor and low on stress. A perennial favorite, French onion soup can be thrown together and then left to simmer for an hour while you bake croutons or simply relax. Try Allison Samson’s take on the dish in our September+October issue, or whip up foolproof Yummy French Onion Soup with a hunk of bread topped with melted mozzarella Daiya for a super-cozy meal. Pair it with Speakeasy Untouchable Pale Ale for a perfect match. Untouchable’s smooth, creamy body and subtle sweetness make it a worthy companion for caramelized onions.  Go-to Risotto
Classic, customizable, and guaranteed to satisfy, risotto is perfect for the cooler months. Adding squash and toasted pumpkin seeds provides a touch of the season’s best colors and flavors to the Italian dish in VegWeb’s Squash Risotto, while white wine and thyme keep it true to form. A pilsner lager like Stella Artois with a light body makes a refreshing complement to this rich stovetop recipe.  Curry in a Hurry
Conjure the aromas of Eastern cuisine with Lentil Potato Coconut Curry, which simmers to perfection in a pressure cooker for an easy-breezy post-work meal. Turn up the heat by tampering with the levels of spice. Lift Bridge Brewery’s Farm Girl Saison makes an ideal escort; it contains beet sugar and orange peel, which add a quiet kick that boosts the curry’s subdued coconut flavor. Oodles of Noodles
The earthy palate of mushrooms gives a touch of umami to plant-based fare such as VegWeb’s Spinach and Mushroom Fettuccine Alfredo, with the decadent essences of porcinis and chanterelles. Ommegang Hennepin has fruity notes and Champagne-like effervescence, rendering it a formidable stand-in for white wine and an appropriate partner for this savory pasta. Holy Casserole
Speaking of fungi: shiitake, eringi, and maitake mushrooms make an appearance with crumbled tempeh and fresh pumpkin in Creamy Pumpkin-Mushroom Casserole, a seasonal take on the traditionally scrumptious baked hodgepodge. The ambrosial medley of mushrooms and delicately sweet pumpkin will wow friends and family at a potluck or holiday dinner. A quintessentially autumnal beer, Terrapin Pumpkinfest is made from real pumpkin and emits the aromas of clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg, possessing a character that is a superb counterpart to this robust casserole. Magical Mousse
Dessert is a crucial ending to any autumn meal, and deserves its own brew to boot. Why be forced to choose between chocolate and holiday spice when the best of both worlds awaits you in Raw Vegan Chocolate Cinnamon Mousse? As a bonus, this chilled treat is made with raw agave, almond butter, and—surprise!—avocados, adding a healthy edge. For a dessert duet, sip on Bison Brewing Company Chocolate Stout. Connoting caramel and roasted barley, this specialty beer ends your meal with a strong and solid kick of cocoa. Photo: GoodBeerFest.com "
CHAI LATTE GELATO,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/chai-latte-gelato,"OCTOBER 23, 2011","While the VegNews office is divided between dedicated disciples of coffee and tea, there is nary a person present who can’t get down with a comforting cup of spicy-sweet goodness in the form of a chai latte. As the schizophrenic weather of San Francisco straddles Indian summer and blustery autumn, our appetites have trouble deciding between toasty beverages and cool delights. But we’ve found the best of both worlds—when we caught wind of Genuto’s frozen, nut-based gelatos, we couldn’t wait to indulge in its array of tempting flavors, including the aforementioned spicy-sweet belly warmer. Scoop, instead of sip, your next chai latte for an entirely new experience—just try to leave some for the rest of us before you polish off a pint. "

As the lions, Bengal tigers, wolves, monkeys, grizzly bears, and other animals roamed into Zanesville, OH, police officers shot and killed 49 of the 56 escaped animals in attempts to mitigate the threat to public safety. Six others were taken alive and transported to the Columbus Zoo, according to CNN, and one monkey remains unaccounted for.

Environmental scientist Richard Routledge, who was on the research team from Simon Fraser University, says that salmon farms may have released the pathogen into wild fish populations through open nets in saltwater pens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention claim that the virus morphed from a benign form into a deadly strain due to densely packed salmon farms in Norway. "

GOING FOR GOLD ON THE ICE,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/going-for-gold-on-the-ice,"OCTOBER 18, 2011","Meagan Duhamel seems to do it all—she studies holistic health, cooks and bakes much of her own food, and spends more than 25 hours per week getting her body in top shape to compete with Canada’s national figure skating team. But having achieved two silver medals in 2011 alone—one at the Canadian Figure Skating Championships and the other at Four Continents Championships—is not enough for this ambitious athlete: She and her partner Eric Radford have already started training for the 2014 Olympics. This skating superstar told us all about her ice escapades and how a vegan lifestyle empowers her to go for the gold. VegNews: What made you decide to go vegan?
Meagan Duhamel: I was reading the book Skinny Bitch one night before bed and thought, “I think I’m going to try this.” All the research I had done said to slowly wean into it, but everything I do is all or nothing. I woke up the next morning and I cleaned out my entire fridge. At the beginning, it was a little test and now it’s been almost three years. The more people told me that it was crazy and that I couldn’t be a vegan and an athlete, the more invested I became in the lifestyle. VN: Is it hard to maintain a vegan lifestyle while competing in countries across the world?
MD: When I first decided to be vegan, we had our national championships in January and I thought I’d find a grocery store when I got there. We had to go practice as soon as we got off the airplane and the only things I could find to eat were five bananas. Since that point, I’ve really had to become organized. I usually make [and bring] homemade bread, pumpkin-apple butter, granola, cookies, trail mixes, and snacks like that. VN: You’re so busy! How do you find time to do everything?
MD: We skate every morning, and in the afternoon I’ll get in an hour or two of studying before I have to go to the gym. I’m actually also studying holistic health at the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition [in hopes of opening a wellness center]. In the evening, I’ll have dinner and study a bit more. Every day is different, but the only consistency is that we skate until noon every single weekday. I’ll prepare food for the week on Sundays because we don’t have training on the weekends. VN: How has a vegan diet fit into your ice skating career?
MD: Between 2008 and 2010, I had a serious back injury. I ended up with nerve damage in my right leg. This was when I started taking B12. B12 really supplements your nerves and having this nerve injury caused me to do a lot of research on home remedies. Since I became a vegan, I’m rarely sick anymore—my body is in top shape and my skin is better. I have a lot more energy at the rink in the morning. I feel refreshed. My weight is very easy to maintain now without much effort. Especially because figure skating is a performance sport, there’s definitely an aesthetic aspect about it. You have to be small to do what I do, so you see a lot of anorexia and bulimia in figure skating, and I think that this was just a way that I could eat healthy but maintain an ideal competitive weight easily. I don’t have to count calories or weigh my food like some other skaters do. I can just eat what I feel is right. VN: What would you say to athletes who are considering a vegan lifestyle?
MD: So many people tell me they could never be vegan. I just wish people would understand and realize that it’s really not that difficult, and it’s a choice that we make—I think that it is in everybody’s grasp to be able to make a decision like switching to a vegan lifestyle. One of my proudest accomplishments has been going vegan.   Photos courtesy of Skate Canada/Scott Grant & Stephan Potopnyk "

As the chain has prepared to open a new franchise in the western state of Gujarat, it will have different uniforms, counters, and cooking areas for veg and non-veg orders in attempts to assuage religious protests from locals, many of whom object to the company’s meat-heavy menu and lack of concern for animal welfare. Local resident Manish Shah tells India’s Economic Times, “Ours is a moral protest against KFC… We feel that KFC is a hardcore non-vegetarian store and is not in alignment with the culture of the residents living nearby.”  "

One of the menu’s most popular offerings: a create-your-own-burger option with toppings like homemade vegan cheese and seitan chorizo. The diner serves all-day breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and boasts an old-fashioned interior with booths and red vinyl stools. Owner Adam Penn, who also owns Veggie Planet in Harvard Square, tells The Boston Globe, “I feel like the vegetarian-vegan aspect of it is just secondary. Really it’s about great food.” "

Subsequently, animal-welfare group Compassion Over Killing has started a “We Love Subway” campaign and website petitioning the chain to expand its veg options and start featuring fake meats, such as Tofurky. So far, the site has collected more than 4,500 comments asking the chain to offer increased options for vegans and vegetarians. "

The program was developed by Sheryl Davies, a self-described foodie who suffers from Celiac disease and says she was tired of making her family eat food vicariously for her, while her own diet was limited by Celiac disease. "
THE RISE OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/the-rise-of-genetically-modified-animals,"OCTOBER 16, 2011","Many of us have fantasized at one time or another about cloning a beloved pet to relive precious memories or shrinking an animal to pocket-size, but what many people don’t know is that genetically engineered animals are no longer just a futuristic idea—they’re very much a reality. For years, researchers have been modifying animals’ genetic material, seeking to further medical, agricultural, and biological technology. But with new conveniences comes new concerns—how will we know when we’ve gone too far? Of Mice and Men
Scientists have been splicing species for nearly three decades, sometimes with Frankensteinian results. The first transgenic animal was created in 1982 by injecting fertilized mouse eggs with a rat’s growth-hormone gene, resulting in giant mice nearly twice the size of their natural counterparts. Pioneered by University of Pennsylvania’s Ralph Brinster and University of Washington’s Richard Palmiter, this technology has been used since on an array of other animals. In 1996, controversy over GM animals resurfaced when a group of Scottish scientists announced that they had successfully cloned an adult sheep known as “Dolly.” Although discussion ensued about the ethical concerns of cloning—more specifically, its dangers and potential to be used for human subjects—more living experiments continued behind closed doors. According to the Center for Genetics and Society, at least 17 other species have been successfully cloned since Dolly. In recent years, attempts to increase the salability of food animals through genetic engineering have only become more apparent. In 2002, Japanese researchers developed transgenic pigs that contained spinach genes in hopes of making pork healthier. Four years later, Harvard scientists with similar aspirations created pigs high in omega-3 fatty acids. While neither of the GM pigs went to market, the Food and Drug Administration is currently deciding whether to approve the sale of GM salmon, engineered by a Massachusetts-based company called AquaBounty Technologies, that grow twice as fast as the wild variety. If approved, the fish will be the first GM animals marketed for human consumption. Other genetically modified animals that are hitting the desks of the FDA: the Enviropig, engineered with a mouse protein that causes it to produce “environmentally friendly” manure low in pollutive phosphorous, and mad cow disease-resistant cattle from the company Hematech. Hybrid Horrors
In addition to genetic engineering for agricultural benefits, animals have also been modified for medical purposes. In 2007, Scottish researchers from the same facility that created Dolly developed transgenic hens that produced pharmaceutical drugs in the proteins of their eggs, which researchers hoped would “bring down the costs of drugs that currently are prohibitively expensive.” Two years later, Russian scientists revealed that they had engineered goats to produce human breast milk in hopes of nourishing babies whose mothers aren’t able to breast-feed them—as well as to exploit the antibiotic qualities of the breast-milk protein lactoferrin. And GM animals are making way more than just milk for human needs—in 2009, British fertility researcher Lord Winston announced that he and his colleagues would be genetically engineering pigs for the purpose of harvesting their organs for human transplants. While the costs of pharmaceuticals can be sky-high, is using goats, pigs, and chickens as living drug factories a sustainable solution?  The More You Know
In 2010, a British report revealed a significant increase in the creation of GM animals in laboratories—of the 3.6 million scientific experiments carried out on animals in the UK in 2009, only 48 percent used genetically “normal” animals, meaning that more than half of research was being conducted on or about GM animals. The FDA also released its finalized set of regulations on GM animals in 2009, which essentially approved the use of genetic engineering as long as the manufacturer can prove the “safety” of the animal itself and of its use for human consumption through food or drugs. Randall Lutter, the organization’s deputy commissioner for policy, comments in the guidelines statement, “Genetic engineering is a cutting edge technology that holds substantial promise for improving the health and well being of people as well as animals.” While GM animals may hold promise in the way of medical advancements or agricultural profitability, one thing that can be argued is that this breed of research merits discussion. While we can’t always control what goes on within laboratories, we can control one thing—what we consume. The Just Label It! campaign aims to attract the FDA’s attention and mandate the labeling of GM foods. Its website includes an online petition where consumers can express their desire for conscientious consumerism directly to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg. GMO’s—whether fruit, vegetable, grain, animal, or some combination of the four—remain one of the most hotly contested subjects in science and culture today. While only time will tell what kinds of benefits or consequences may result from tweaking genetic blueprints, the time is now to learn about this contentious issue and its implications for human and animal welfare.

FOOD ADS’ STRONG IMPACT ON KIDS,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/food-ads-strong-impact-on-kids,"OCTOBER 15, 2011","New research shows that fast-food ads have a strong impact on kids’ decisions, but parents can help to steer them into healthy choices. The new study, published in The Journal of Pediatrics, observed 75 young children as they watched a series of two cartoons with commercials for either French fries or apple slices with dipping sauce. Afterwards, the children could choose a coupon for either food with input from their parents, half of whom encouraged the apple slices and half of whom remained neutral. Of the children who watched the French fries commercial, 71 percent chose the coupon for fries if their parents were neutral, versus 55 percent if their parents suggested the apple slices. In the apple-commercial group, only 46 percent of the neutral-parents group picked French fries, and only 33 percent of those with influence from their parents. "
STUDY: GULF SEAFOOD UNSAFE,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/study-gulf-seafood-unsafe,"OCTOBER 14, 2011","A new study from the Natural Resources Defense Council has found that the health risks associated with contaminants of the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico were severely underestimated by the Food and Drug Administration. Shortly after the disaster, Gulf seafood was deemed safe to eat. However, the NRDC says the FDA’s outdated assumptions allowed up to 10,000 times the safe levels of crude oil chemical contaminate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Scientists have linked PAHs to cancer, birth defects, and liver disease, which could mean serious health problems for those who consumed too much Gulf seafood after the spill. "

Despite this, inspectors have witnessed farmers polluting water with cow manure, which is dangerous for the drinking water supply and the environment, but have chosen not to issue fines. Additionally, federal investigators found that roughly 75 percent of the environmental reports checked by the Georgia Department of Agriculture were faulty or incomplete, furthering the state’s waters’ risk of pollution from farms. “If a farm is not inspected or looked at, does it have a violation?” Justine Thompson, of environmental law firm GreenLaw, tells The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “They are not inspecting these places.

10 QUESTIONS WITH BIG VEGAN’S ROBIN ASBELL,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/10-questions-with-big-vegans-robin-asbell,"OCTOBER 9, 2011","Robin Asbell is a bit of a Renaissance woman. When she’s not teaching veg cooking classes, speaking at meetings and conferences about whole-foods nutrition, or whipping up gorgeous family meals as a personal chef, she manages to write and compile hundreds of mouthwatering recipes for her cookbooks, the newest of which is Big Vegan, out this month from Chronicle Books. We caught up with this multitalented maestro, who shared insight on her dish-inventing process, her vegan inspirations, and her favorite recipes from her new book. VegNews: Congratulations on the release of Big Vegan! How was the process of writing it compared to your previous books, The New Vegetarian and The New Whole Grains Cookbook?
Robin Asbell: Well, it was much more intense, in that I had about the same amount of time to do almost 400 recipes as I had to do 75 in the other two books. It was a joy to be working with great ingredients and I got lots of encouragement from my tasters. I sent a lot of the food to work with my husband, and the non-vegan carpenter guys really enjoyed it. That made me feel better about working seven days a week. VN: How did you pick the title Big Vegan?
RA: My publisher, Chronicle Books, came up with the title; it’s kind of a series they do. I spent some time mulling it over and decided that it meant big flavor, and that [veganism] was going to keep getting bigger. VN: The book contains more than 350 recipes. What’s your process for coming up with new dishes?
RA: I am so immersed in cooking and creating recipes—it’s really a lifestyle. I make menus for clients, for magazine articles, for classes, and build things in that mode, then creating the thing itself. I also try to give myself the occasional break and just cook with what’s in season at the farmers’ market and see what happens. When I put together the recipes for the book, it was a list-making exercise, combining dishes I had made before and loved, and then filling the in-between with things I thought would balance it all out. VN: You’ve written articles about raw and gluten-free foods. Can we expect these types of recipes in Big Vegan as well?
RA: A few, but not really. I was going for [just] vegan dishes that I thought beginning or temporary vegans could relate to. I want to seduce the skeptics into eating and believing. VN: How did you learn how to cook and develop your own recipes?
RA: I actually have a degree in art, and was halfway to a master’s when I decided that I could have an impact by cooking. I worked in a number of kitchens where I was able to be creative, and I was creative at home. It was just something I did. I had to teach myself to be disciplined, and measure, and all that. I think when you go veg in a small town where nobody else is doing it, you just have to do a lot of reading and exploring. I just turned my academic and arts skills toward the study of food. VN: What were the primary motivators behind your dedication to veganism?
RA: I was very moved by John Robbins’ book, Diet for a New America. When it came out in the mid-80s, I was working at a whole-foods bakery/deli, and there was a committed vegan there who recommended the book. It put all the pieces together for me. I knew the plate was powerful, but he laid it out all in one place. VN: As a culinary instructor, have you seen an increased demand for vegan cooking classes over the past few years or a more mainstream audience become interested in plant-based foods?
RA: Here in Minneapolis, it’s sometimes hard to get the classes on the schedule and filled. This is dairy country. Cooking schools have been facing their own struggles, and when they can put a steak class in the book and fill it to capacity every time, they have a financial impetus to do so. That said, I do see growth, and when I teach the classes, I meet the nicest people. Vegans are so happy to finally get a class designed for them; it’s kind of a party/support group. And often, when I ask who in the class is vegan or vegetarian, it’s only one or two [students]. People are coming around to it gradually, so I try to be welcoming and non-judgmental. They can inch in, as long as they move in the right direction. VN: What are your favorite vegan products for super quick and easy meals at home?
RA: Call me old school, but I like cans of mock duck. I keep lots of [non-dairy] milks and coconut milk on hand, as well as stocks and stuff. I have a couple of Indian products, foil packs or cans of chole or curried lentils, that I like to throw in a pan and add veggies, tofu, or whatever to. I’m a big condiment user—I keep stuff like tapenade, Sriracha, miso, gomasio, and dijon handy for making simple things better. VN: How does it feel to be part of the vegan cookbook author community?
RA: It’s wonderful. This business is nothing like you think it would be, once you get into it. All my author friends are amazingly supportive and we can relate. It’s all so new when you start out, and you feel so alone there at the computer. The vegan authors I know are just as kind, beautiful, and generous as you think they are when you read their books. VN: Is there any one recipe in Big Vegan that you would designate as “must-try?” A personal favorite or a can’t-miss slam dunk? RA: That question is always a Sophie’s Choice; They are all my babies. Of late, I am in love with the Almond-Cashew Chevre; I think that it satisfies that cheese urge that is so pervasive. I have been keeping a jar of it in the fridge and slathering it on bagels, bruschetta, pizza, you name it. I picked the Creamy Triple Mushroom Fettuccine with Walnuts recipe for my book trailer because I think it illustrates how I build flavor and umami with certain ingredients—and it’s super tasty. I [also] have a huge thing for the Double Chocolate-Chip Cookies and Peanut-Butter Ice Cream. Photo courtesy of Jennie Sewell  "
FARM SANCTUARY’S END FACTORY FARMING CONFERENCE,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/farm-sanctuarys-end-factory-farming-conference,"OCTOBER 9, 2011","Farm Sanctuary has had a big year. In addition to celebrating its 25th anniversary, expanding its facilities, hosting its biggest nationwide Walk For Farm Animals event yet, and launching the Just Eats cross-country tour, the animal-welfare organization will be hosting the first National Conference to End Factory Farming in Arlington, VA on October 27 to 29, in hopes of drawing attention to the environmental, ethical, and health consequences of industrial animal agriculture. VegNews caught up with Baur to get the inside scoop on this exciting and meaningful event. VegNews: How and when did the National Conference for Factory Farming come together?
Gene Baur: At Farm Sanctuary, we’ve been working to combat factory farming for a long time. It’s an issue that we’re very concerned about that is now getting mainstream attention. There is growing mainstream opposition to factory farming and growing awareness about it, so we discussed this [issue] internally at the organization, and decided that it would be good to have a conference like this to really call for an answer to it. VN: Many researchers, experts, and officials—in addition to animal-welfare activists—are in agreement that factory farming is severely harmful in myriad ways. What do you think needs to be done in order to make the public and legislators realize that this is an issue that seriously affects all of us?
GB: I think that is starting to happen. It’s really just about awareness; people need to look at the facts and come to understand the impacts of this industry, and also recognize their own complicity in it. The consumers who are buying factory-farmed products are supporting this system, and the vast majority of [Americans] are unwittingly supporting animal cruelty. They are also eating food that is making them sick and supporting an agricultural system that is destroying the planet. But people are starting to realize that that’s the case. What we [are seeing] now is a number of products being marketed as cage-free, free-range, and so on, and those are positive steps because it shows that there’s an awareness, but oftentimes those products are being raised in conditions that are basically factory-farm conditions.  VN: What would you say to people who say, “I only eat free-range this” or “I only eat grass-fed that?”
GB: I would say that in most cases, those products are coming from animals that are raised in factory-farm conditions. In some cases, it is possible that the animals are being treated significantly better, and if that’s the case, then it’s certainly less bad, and it also requires people to eat fewer animal products, so those are steps in the right direction. But at the end of the day, it’s not necessary to eat any animal products. We’ll continue to hold up the vegan ideal, but we will also support and encourage any steps that move away from the industrial factory-farming model. VN: On that note, what perspective did you gain on how the Standard American Diet is influenced by factory farming when you were on the Just Eats tour?
GB: In many parts of America, you see people suffering from heart disease and obesity, folks that are routinely on heart medication. Just like the TV commercials that are constantly promoting these drugs, whose market is enhanced by our unhealthy, animal-based diet. But a large part of [the tour] was focused on the movement towards a plant-based diet. I saw people in urban and rural areas in every corner of the country coming to be aware of factory farming and the benefits of plant-based eating, and it was a very inspiring, positive experience. VN: How does it feel to see huge public figures, like Bill Clinton and Al Gore, talking about and steering people toward plant-based diets?
GB: It feels great! They’re talking about it for different reasons, and that points to how we have a convergence of issues now. We have awareness about health, and Bill Clinton obviously represents that point of view, and a growing awareness about the environment, and Al Gore represents that point of view. But we also have growing awareness about animal welfare, and we have people like Ellen DeGeneres who is an outspoken vegan because of ethical concerns. It’s been a long time coming, but it feels very good, and I think it’s the beginning of more of it, frankly. VN: What kind of immediate results would you like to see come out of the conference?
GB: I would like to see more people—especially influential people, people who work in USDA, and others in Washington—take to heart that this is an issue that needs to be addressed, and soon, and in significant ways. Ultimately, we need a pretty major shift, and I hope that this conference starts leading towards more plant-based and community-based agriculture—things like farmers’ markets, community gardens, even urban gardening. I hope that this conference helps to promote those types of alternatives to the typical industrial animal-farming model. VN: For those of us who can’t attend the conference, how can people get involved on a small-scale or community level?
GB: Going vegan is number one, far and away. After that, I would say being a good representative of vegan living is another very important thing. Each of us are ambassadors, and if we come across as too judgmental, angry, or misanthropic, it’s not going to help our cause. In addition to adopting a vegan lifestyle ourselves, it’s important to try to reach other people and to be an example of healthful, compassionate living that others would like to emulate. We [also] encourage people to check out the Farm Sanctuary website and to get involved with our programs for farm animals every year. Just be conscientious consumers and active advocates—going to restaurants, encouraging them to serve more locally produced, plant-based options, and [eating] in a way that is aligned with their own interests and their own values. Being mindful, and not supporting an industry that’s so harmful. VN: On top of your 25th anniversary celebrations, the conference, and a new small animal hospital, what other projects are coming up for Farm Sanctuary this year?
GB: We recently acquired Animal Acres, a small sanctuary in Los Angeles that had been having difficulties, so they came to us and asked if we could take it on. We’re [also] going to be supporting federal legislation in Washington, DC to ban battery cages nationwide, which came out of initiative work in the Northwest where we were working with HSUS and others to get a measure on the ballot. The United Egg Producers were concerned, after Prop. 2 passed in California a few years ago, that we would see different states with different laws, so they agreed to support federal legislation to ban battery cages. That’s going to be a big push in Washington in the coming year.  Photo: Derek Goodwin "

The National Meat Association recently filed a lawsuit to overturn a three-year-old California law that prohibits the buying, selling, or receiving of animals too disabled to walk at slaughterhouses, stockyards, or auctions. Farm Sanctuary, the Humane Farming Association, the Humane Society of the United States, and the Animal Legal Defense Fund have all signed the brief opposing the NMA’s lawsuit. In addition to being cruel, the practice of slaughtering disabled animals can also be dangerous to the food supply; downer cattle have been shown to carry dangerous pathogens.

Shoppers can enjoy an array of high-quality beauty products—such as shimmery eye shadow, professional application brushes, and bright lip pigment—formulated without the use of animal testing or by-products. The store’s opening gala featured vegan fare like meat-free chicken wings and enjoyed visits from celebrities like Project Runway’s Gretchen Jones. “[Animal] testing has become unfashionable and less cost-effective,” the beauty brand says on its website. “OCC felt it was necessary to raise the bar on this issue.” "
DENMARK TAXES FATTY FOODS,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/denmark-taxes-fatty-foods,"OCTOBER 5, 2011","Last weekend, Denmark put a new tax into effect that will increase the prices of fatty foods in hopes of reducing the nation’s obesity and disease rates. Hamburgers, butter, and potato chips are just a few of the items that will be affected by the “fat tax,” which is intended to cut obesity and heart disease rates and increase the country’s average life expectancy by three years over the next decade. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 13.4 percent of the Danish population is obese, compared with 33.8 percent of Americans. Last month, Hungary put a similar measure into effect, increasing taxes on foods high in saturated fats, sugar, and salt in hopes of reducing health care costs. "
VEGAN COOKBOOK RETURNS,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/vegan-cookbook-returns,"OCTOBER 5, 2011","People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ President Ingrid Newkirk is re-releasing her vegan cookbook The Compassionate Cook, Or “Please Don’t Eat The Animals!” First published in 1993, the book features more than 200 cruelty-free recipes and has sold more than 50,000 copies. The new edition has been prompted by the recent increase in public figures, like President Bill Clinton, discussing the benefits of a plant-based diet. In a press release, The Price Is Right’s Bob Barker says, “I became a vegetarian because of my concern for animals, but I soon learned to appreciate the many health benefits to be derived from recipes such as you will find in The Compassionate Cook.” "
SACRAMENTO VEG CHEF CONTEST,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/sacramento-veg-chef-contest,"OCTOBER 5, 2011","The California Vegan Restaurants organization has designed a contest to challenge local chefs’ vegan cooking skills for the entire month of October. Ten restaurants are participating by creating specialty vegan appetizers, soups, entrées, and desserts, in an effort to bring thoughtful and creative cruelty-free options to California’s capital. Diners can enter a raffle and vote for their favorite meals on the challenge’s survey—chefs with the most votes will win prizes, too. Inspired by the Bull City Vegan Challenge in North Carolina, the Sacramento-based organizers hope to inspire other cities across the nation to develop their own vegan restaurant contests. "
EGGS LINKED TO CANCER,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/eggs-linked-to-cancer,"OCTOBER 4, 2011","Last month, Cancer Prevention Research published the results of a National Institutes of Health-funded 14-year study that found a link between lethal prostate cancer and the consumption of eggs. After following more than 27,000 men from 1994 to 2008, researchers found that otherwise-healthy men who ate two-and-a-half or more eggs per week were 81 percent more likely to develop fatal prostate cancer than those who consumed less than half an egg each week. Conversely, the American Institute of Cancer Research recommends a plant-heavy diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans to combat the risk of developing cancer. "

MONTH OF VEGAN BLOGGING,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/month-of-vegan-blogging,"OCTOBER 4, 2011","The fifth-annual Vegan MoFo kicked off October 1, and roughly 650 bloggers have pledged to write about vegan food nearly every day for the month of October. Last year included book giveaways, amazing recipes (like sticky toffee pudding), and hundreds of bloggers putting forth the best of what veganism can offer. Amey Mathews, an organizer of the event and creator of the blog, Vegan Eats & Treats, gave VegNews the exclusive scoop on how Vegan MoFo will impact the veg community this time around. VegNews: What is Vegan MoFo?
Amey Mathews: Vegan MoFo is a blogging event wherein bloggers post every day for the whole month. It started about five years ago from Isa [Chandra Moskowitz] at The Post Punk Kitchen, and I think it was one of her many great ideas on building community and building visibility for veganism in a fun way. Obviously, using bloggers which have more visibility [than single websites] makes it seem like something fun and something for everyone collectively to have a sense of community and enthusiasm. VN: How can people get involved?
AM: Even if they aren’t on the official list [which closed on September 28], they can always check our Facebook page. Also, we have a brand new, official website—veganmofo.com, where there will be an official list of all the participating blogs. Every day of the month, one of us will publish a roundup. We’ll look at a whole bunch of different blogs and what they posted that day, and then we’ll try to do a fun post so that even if you don’t have time to read all the hundreds of blogs, you can go on Vegan MoFo and click. It’s really fun because even last year, I discovered so many new blogs that I hadn’t found before. A lot of people started a blog just for MoFo and now they’re still blogging a year later. There is definitely some exclusive content, and people from all over the world participate. VN: How will your blog change during Vegan MoFo?
AM: I’m doing a theme. I’m really nuts for themes in general in my life. Last year I did Around the World in 30 Days; this year, I’m doing a different spice every day. I have a huge, enormous spice collection and I’m planning on cooking something from one in my collection every single day. I’m stoked. VN: How do you think Vegan MoFo impacts the veg movement?
AM: It’s playful and it’s positive. Even though all of us are really passionate for various ethical or environmental reasons associated with being vegan, Vegan MoFo is a really accessible event so even if people don’t want to get into a debate about animal welfare, they can go and just see all these great meals, and that vegan food looks delicious and vegan people are fun. It’s really light and has to do with food, which we all eat and enjoy. I think it’s a nice way in for people who otherwise might be a little bit more reluctant to be interested in veganism. VN: How has Vegan MoFo changed throughout the years?
AM; I would say it has changed by exploding in size and by really going international. The first year, it was really just people who were on the PPK who knew about it. But now, it’s really grown, and bloggers, even if they aren’t regularly a part of the PPK forum community, know about it and look forward to it. [It builds] the sense of community you have, knowing that there’s someone out there doing the same thing with the same beliefs. VN: Where do you see MoFo going in the future?
AM: I would really love for it to keep being international and really expanding. I sense that themes is a direction Vegan MoFo is going in for a lot of bloggers; people seem to be enjoying that and finding that it gives them a little more discipline, like I did. I just really hope that it will keep expanding and keep gaining momentum. VN: How is blogging affecting the veg movement?
AM: I went to Vida Vegan Con and was surprised at how different we all were. There were a lot of college-aged kids and there were a lot of grandmas. I was looking around at all these different walks of life, people covered in tattoos and people in button-down cardigans, and there was this sense that you could sit down at anyone’s breakfast table and know that you would enjoy the conversation. There’s the intangible thing that we’re all bloggers, and then there’s this very tangible thing that we’re all vegan. It was really this amazing sense of community and friendship and not feeling vulnerable at all. There were hundreds of people, it was amazing, and it sold out months in advance; so clearly, vegan blogging is doing something for a lot of us. Having a sense of community online really supported my decision [to go veg], and always learning about new products and new recipes and new cooking techniques really makes it more fun and interesting to be a vegan. Spiritually, I’ve just received so much support from my pals online. They mean so much to me. "
MOM BLOGGER’S VEGAN SHOE LINE,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/mom-bloggers-vegan-shoe-line,"OCTOBER 4, 2011","Stay-at-home mom and vegan blogger Elizabeth Katzman has just released a line of cruelty-free women’s shoes on her website, Elizabeth’s Kind Café. The Michigan “momtrepreneur” has designed a variety of trendy boots, heels, platforms, and sandals for women who seek leather-free fashion. All of her designs—which include faux-suede slingbacks, combat boots, and flip-flops embellished with the slogan “Go Veg”—are crafted from recycled, eco-friendly, and biodegradable materials. Katzman, a former lawyer, now uses her website and a weekly community television show to promote cruelty-free living. “The vegan lifestyle makes sense on so many levels,” she says in a press release, “and that means not only what we eat, but what we put on our bodies and in our homes.” "
GIADA DEVELOPS VEG RECIPES,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/giada-develops-veg-recipes,"OCTOBER 3, 2011","Giada De Laurentiis, host of the Emmy Award-winning cooking show Everyday Italian, announced recently that she will be developing more vegetarian recipes for 2012. In a video, De Laurentiis says, “I was shocked at the overwhelming response that most people wanted some really creative, tasty vegetarian dishes.” She has already created three meat-free dishes for her Vegetarian Delight Recipes website on foodnetwork.com, including one vegan recipe (Curried White Bean dip), and two other recipes (Whole-Grain Spaghetti with Brussels Sprouts and Mushrooms, and Goat Cheese, Lentil, and Brown Rice Rolls), both easily made dairy-free with vegan substitutions. De Laurentiis was inspired by her mother, who ditched meat more than a decade ago, and predicts that the big food trend of 2012 will be vegetarian cuisine. "
METAL FRAGMENTS IN PORK,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/metal-fragments-in-pork,"OCTOBER 3, 2011","Last week, the US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service announced a recall of thousands of pounds of pork products possibly contaminated with metal fragments. Two customers reported finding small metal pieces in puréed pork products sold by K. Heeps, Inc., in Allentown, PA. Manufactured last June, the 5,550 pounds of product were shipped to a dozen states for use in institutions. Officials suspect that pieces of the blending equipment may have broken off during a routine cleanup and reassembly. Currently, no illness or injuries from the products have been reported. "
TRAVIS BARKER TALKS VEGANISM,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/travis-barker-talks-veganism,"OCTOBER 3, 2011","Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker has opened up about his decision to go veg in a new interview with Rolling Stone. Barker, who was eating “fake meat” and broccoli during the tell-all, said that he decided to reevaluate his priorities and go vegan after he nearly died in a 2008 plane crash that took the lives of four others and critically injured his friend and collaborator DJ AM. “It’s another eye opener,” the rocker says about his vegan lifestyle in the interview. “It changed my life in a number of ways… In the hospital, I promised myself that I [if] ever walked again, that I would eat well and swim every day.” "
PET-FRIENDLY HOTELS,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/pet-friendly-hotels,"OCTOBER 3, 2011","How can any vacation be a true family getaway without bringing along our furry friends? After all, they accompany us on walks, invite us to romp with them at the dog park, and even let us choose the radio station on road trips. Fortunately, hotels across the US feature dog-friendly accommodations, making our animal companions feel the same level of comfort as we have come to expect from class-act hotels on our get-out-of-town adventures. Check-In
The first step in a successful vacation is a welcoming check-in from friendly staff and a clean, comfortable room chockfull of amenities that make us, and our animal companions, feel right at home. In San Francisco’s Fairmont hotel, your pooch can settle in to the room by finding his or her own Fairmont doggy bowl and bed, and that’s just the beginning—the rooms also have canine mini-bars with cable car-decorated cookies, organic peanut brittle, and rope toys, as well as a lemongrass-peppermint-clove spritzer to help dogs sleep comfortably in their own beds. While many hotels have snuggly robes waiting for their guests, dogs at The Fairmont can look forward to a stylish new silver dog tag, which will make them the envy of all their pooch pals back at home. Satiating the Insatiable
After such a long trip (or short trip, or no trip at all), Fido is probably starving, per usual. Fortunately, hotel restaurants have even started catering room service to canine guests and their insatiable appetites. If vacation brings you to the Windy City, dogs can feast as stylishly as Donald himself at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, with chef-prepared hot meals of your four-legged jet-setter’s favorite veggies—just call the room service staff to discuss dinner plans. If your heart is set on the Big Apple, consider a stay at Loews Regency Hotel, as its pet menu includes a “Wag Your Tail Delight” meal. Your pooch will love the Great Vegetable Feast, which features mixed veggies over rice. Room service staff insists that even humans can nosh on that meal, so try not to drool! Beyond the Dog Park
In Scottsdale, the W Hotel will help Fido get his Zen on with doggy yoga classes. Just remember to bring your own mat to experience an entirely new meaning of downward-facing dog! And surfs up at Loews Coronado Bay Resort’s annual Surf Dog Competition. Winners are awarded a getaway at the resort, so encourage Fido to hang 20 with dog surfing classes, which can be arranged at the Coronado Surfing Academy via the resort’s concierge. In Colorado, Doggie Daybreak and Twilight Hikes offered at the Ritz-Carlton will have your pooch breathing in the fresh air of Beaver Creek Mountain twice daily. If that’s not enough, most dog-friendly hotels provide guests with area handbooks, featuring the scoop on the local events that may be of interest to your pooch. Pampered Pooch
After months of chasing squirrels and fetching sticks, even your dog is due for a little rest and relaxation. Doggy divas can opt for a Rover Reiki Massage at the Topnotch Resort and Spa in Stowe, VT. If Santa Fe awaits you, consider a stay at Ten Thousand Waves, where your pooch can indulge alongside you in the Japanese-style private hot baths. While dogs are not allowed in the communal baths, your pup will love plunging into the waterfall-style outdoor private bath. Or, if you’re craving a city-style getaway, a stay at Kimpton Muse Hotel in New York will get your pup’s nails looking top notch with its doggy mani-pedi option. Meet and Greet
Sometimes, the most outstanding memories from vacations are of the friends you make along the way. Hotel Monaco in Alexandria, VA, hosts a twice-weekly doggie happy hour from April through October with complementary treats and fresh water. The concierge of the hotel can also organize tickets for Potomac River Boat Company’s Canine Cruise, further giving Fido opportunities to socialize. If it’s your dog’s special day, many locations of the worldwide chain of Starwood Hotels can arrange for a special veg birthday cake, so invite all the new friends along to celebrate! "
LAWSUIT AGAINST PET STORE,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/lawsuit-against-pet-store,"OCTOBER 2, 2011","Late last week, the Animal Legal Defense Fund filed suit against a Barkworks, claiming that the Southern California pet store chain misleads customers about sourcing animals from puppy mills. According to ALDF, information in the lawsuit alleges that Barkworks routinely disclosed inaccurate USDA breeder numbers in sales contracts with customers, making it impossible for them to track the “reputable breeders” Barkworks claims to get their animals from. Despite receiving warranties from the store that its animals are not ill and are fit for sale, individual plaintiffs also say that recently purchased puppies turned out to be extremely sick. ALDF’s Director of Litigation, Carter Dillard, says, “It is time for the court to intervene to stop Barkworks’ blatant and illegal deceptive practices.” "
CANTALOUPE LISTERIA OUTBREAK,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/cantaloupe-listeria-outbreak,"OCTOBER 2, 2011","A recent outbreak of the deadly bacteria listeria in cantaloupe has sickened dozens of people and killed 15 others in the past few weeks. The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall for more than 300,000 cases—or up to 4.5 million melons—of the potentially infected fruit, which originated from Jensen Farms in Colorado. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg expects illness rates to continue rising in the coming weeks because it can often take weeks, or even months, for listeria bacteria to incubate. On September 29, California lettuce producer True Leaf Farms also recalled 30,000 pounds of chopped romaine lettuce due to suspected listeria contamination. Although lesser known than E. coli and salmonella, the deadly bacteria is considered very dangerous, especially for the elderly, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems. "
FACTORY FARMING DEATHS,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/factory-farming-deaths,"OCTOBER 2, 2011","A piece published in The Kansas City Star questions whether or not factory farming is responsible for this summer’s incidents wherein roughly 4,000 turkeys, 2,500 hogs, and 50,000 chickens, died of heatstroke. Animal-rights advocates like Paul Shapiro of the Human Society of the United States believe that housing livestock in this manner increases the risks of thousands of animals dying at one time. Two of the main problems associated with animal deaths at feedlots are disabled fans caused by power outages and extreme weather conditions, which cause animals to overheat and die, despite attempts at cooling them down via the use of sprinklers. Tim Gibbons, of the Missouri Rural Crisis Center, told the paper, “The industry claims putting thousands of animals in a building … is the wave of the future. It has sort of backfired in these cases because the result is thousands of animals dying.” "
BE KIND TO ANIMALS WEEK,https://vegnews.com/2011/10/be-kind-to-animals-week,"OCTOBER 1, 2011","This week, Edgar’s Mission Farm Sanctuary in Willowmavin, Victoria, Australia, has declared its second annual Be Kind to Animals Week. From October 1 to 7, the initiative reaches out to the public and asks people to get involved with animal-welfare organizations, do something kind for animals in their lives, put thought into animal-rights issues, and engage in conscious consumerism, such as only using and eating cruelty-free products. The week’s official website features special events for each day of the program, such as sanctuary tours, movie night fundraisers, and animal camping nights. Participants are also welcome to register their own events. "
VEGAN STRIP CLUB CONTROVERSY,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/vegan-strip-club-controversy,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2011","Casa Diablo, Portland, OR’s all-vegan strip club, drew controversy this week and protests from neighbors with plans to open a second location. The club serves a meat- and dairy-free menu of items like mushroom burgers, chili cheese fries, and cheesecake, with a backdrop of topless dancers and private rooms. The establishment also forbids its primarily veg dancers from wearing fur, leather, silk, wool, or feathers onstage in the name of animal welfare. The club’s owner, Johnny Diablo, refers to himself as an ethical vegan and argues that the naked women lure men in, and in turn, they will learn to appreciate vegan food. Not everyone agrees; Julie Bindel writes in the UK’s The Guardian, “Are you a man who cares about animals but thinks it is fine to treat women like one? Then Casa Diablo is the place for you.” "
NEW VEGAN COOKING SHOW,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/new-vegan-cooking-show,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2011","A new all-veg cooking show will be premiering tomorrow on local public broadcast stations around the country. The Jazzy Vegetarian, hosted by Laura Theodore, a New Jersey cook and soon-to-be cookbook author, aims to show both veg and omnivorous food connoisseurs alike how easy, enjoyable, and sophisticated vegan cuisine can be. The show will demonstrate how to make dishes such as zucchini lasagna, crispy portobello steaks, and raspberry maple tofu whip. Thirteen episodes of the program have already been filmed, and the show has been picked up by more than 130 stations—about 70 percent of the public-television market. Theodore’s book—a companion to the show—is also scheduled to be released in October.   "
NYC ANIMAL SERVICES EXPAND,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/nyc-animal-services-expand,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2011","Earlier this week, New York City’s Mayor Bloomberg signed a law that will expand animal care and control services in the five boroughs. The bill will lengthen the hours city-run shelters can receive animals—two shelters in Queens and the Bronx will now be open for 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and an additional shelter will soon be open 24 hours a day. Additionally, the law will increase fines against cat owners who neglect to neuter animal companions who roam outdoors. While the city shelters do practice euthanasia, Bloomberg says “[this law] will substantially enhance the scope of animal care and control services… and focus their efforts on increased adoption and reduced animal populations through methods other than euthanasia.” "
NEW DOLPHIN SPECIES FOUND,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/new-dolphin-species-found,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2011","Researchers have recently discovered a new species of dolphin—the Burrunan—and it may already be endangered. Burrunan dolphins had previously been grouped with two species of bottlenose dolphin, all of which inhabit the southeast coast of Australia, but a recent report published in PloS One indicates that this particular species has demonstrated unique characteristics, such as skull shape, coloration, size, and variation of DNA. Unfortunately, the scientists suspect that the species only has about 150 individuals, which may qualify them for protection under certain laws. The report says, “…only two small resident populations in close proximity to a major urban and agricultural center are known, giving them a high conservation value and making them susceptible to numerous anthropogenic threats.” "
BRAIN ABILITIES LINKED TO B-12,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/brain-abilities-linked-to-b-12,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2011","A new study published in the scientific journal Neurology has found that vitamin B-12 deficiency is associated with lower brain measures. More than 120 participants over the age of 65 had their levels of B-12, cognitive skills, and brain scans analyzed twice, with nearly a five-year difference in between. Researchers found that those who had four of the five B-12 deficiency markers also had lower brain volume and scored lower on cognitive function tests, demonstrating poorer episodic and semantic memory and perceptual speed. While many sources of vitamin B-12 come from animal products, there are vegan alternatives—veganhealth.org has published a guide to veg-friendly B-12 sources, which includes nutritional yeast and supplements.

VEGGIE CONSUMPTION RISES,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/veggie-consumption-rises,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2011","Yesterday, the American Dietetic Association released the results of a recent poll of dietary habits among the general public. The findings reveal that nearly half of respondents have increased their consumption of vegetables over the past five years, and 48 percent have also upped their intake of whole-grain foods. The poll also reveals that 39 percent of people have decreased their consumption of beef, and consumption of pork and dairy also went down for 35 percent and 22 percent, respectively. More than 750 people participated in the telephone survey, titled Nutrition and You: Trends 2011, which asked American adults to describe whether their consumption of various foods has increased, decreased, or remained the same over the past half-decade.

The petition was created on We the People, a new website from the White House that allows users to create petitions which will be reviewed by the government if they gather more than 5,000 signatures in a month. More than 8,300 people have already signed PETA’s petition, which was launched on September 22. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, up to 7 million companion animals are sheltered annually and roughly half are euthanized; if the petition is successful, it could significantly reduce the number of unwanted pets in the US.

"UPCOMING COOKBOOK STARS, PART DEUX",https://vegnews.com/2011/9/upcoming-cookbook-stars-part-deux,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2011","In the September+October issue of VegNews—our annual Food Issue—we featured six upcoming cookbook stars and first-time authors, asking them about the tomes (and people) who have inspired their culinary careers the most. And we have two more to add to the list: Bianca Phillips, author of Cookin’ Crunk: Eatin’ Vegan in the Dirty South (out in January 2012), and Julie Morris, whose Superfood Cuisine was released in June. Read on to find out about the cookbooks they can’t help but turn to year after year, which ones they’d gift, and those with which they are currently obsessed. VegNews: What cookbook have you used the most in your life? Why has it stood the test of time, and what recipe do you cook most frequently from it?
Bianca Phillips: La Dolce Vegan! by Sarah Kramer. I love all of her books, but the Faux Fare chapter in La Dolce Vegan! taught me how to make homemade seitan. I use Sarah’s boiling technique more than any other method. In fact, the seitan recipes in my upcoming cookbook use the same technique.
Julie Morris: Covered in splotches, sticky pages, and housing a few old shopping lists, my copy of World Food Café shows all the signs of a well-loved cookbook. I’ve built an entire spice collection around this book! Making and eating foods from different cultures is a great education in flavor combinations, and dramatically enhances creativity in the kitchen. I made my dad a variation of the recipe for Sweet Potatoes in a Cayenne, Ginger, and Groundnut Sauce about a decade ago, and he still requests it every Father’s Day. VN: What established cookbook author do you find most inspiring and why?
BP: I have to go with Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero. Every one of their books is amazing. Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World changed my life. Before receiving that book as a Christmas gift years ago, I wasn’t a huge dessert fan, but I developed a sweet tooth the day I tried the Basic Chocolate Cupcakes. I haven’t looked back since.
JM: Charlie Trotter’s books always blow me away. To say that his recipes are works of art is an understatement. His recipes are so thoughtful and refined; he seems to always make sure every last detail is in place. His food is just magnificent! VN: If you could have written any cookbook that already exists, which one and why?
BP: Alicia Simpson’s Quick and Easy Vegan Comfort Food. I rarely cook gourmet meals because I find so much more joy in preparing (and eating) simple soul food. My cookbook is also filled with comfort food eats, and I feel like Alicia and I share similar tastes.
JM: Naked Chocolate by David Wolfe and Shazzie, though my real reasons for wanting to create copious amounts of cacao-themed recipes should be fairly obvious. VN: What cookbook are you most excited about right now?
BP: Appetite for Reduction. I’ve been cooking from that book at least once every week. My favorite recipes include Baked Falafel, Hoisin-Mustard Tofu, and Sushi-Roll Edamame Salad. It’s nice to know that I can make delicious vegan food that isn’t loaded with calories.
JM: I just got a copy of Plenty by Yotam Ottolenghi and am so excited to take it for a whirl in the kitchen! I really appreciate Oggolenghi’s masterful yet unpretentious approach to vegetables, and many of the recipes are easy to veganize, when necessary. VN: What’s your go-to cookbook to give as a gift?
BP: La Dolce Vegan!. I gave this to my best friend when she went veg because I wanted to share my obsession with boiled, homemade seitan. Plus, Sarah is so cute and kitschy.
JM: My new go-to gift book is Going Raw by my friend Judita Wignall. So many people are becoming interested in incorporating more raw foods into their diet, and Going Raw serves as an ideal place to begin. The recipes are easy to follow, earn a gold star in the “super yum” department, and the book itself is stunning. "
DAIRY INDUSTRY LAWSUIT,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/dairy-industry-lawsuit,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2011","Yesterday, a group of consumers, including members of animal-welfare organization Compassion Over Killing, filed a class-action lawsuit against dairy companies and trade groups who produce nearly 70 percent of the milk in the US. The complaint alleges that the dairy groups had formed the collective committee Cooperatives Working Together in order to control prices across the country by paying farmers to slaughter their cattle in order to reduce milk supply, resulting in more than $9 billion in additional revenue for CWT members. Although the dairy herd retirement program, as the slaughtering practice was called, ended last summer, milk prices may be affected for years. Compassion Over Killing General Counsel Cheryl Leahy comments, “What I hope people take away from this is that the dairy industry is not all happy cows and green pastures. Rather, the reality is massive agribusiness players clearly have little regard for the animals or consumers.” "
CATALONIA’S LAST BULLFIGHT,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/catalonias-last-bullfight,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2011","Last Sunday, Barcelona, Spain held the last bullfight in the Catalonia region. The regional legislature approved a ban on the cruel sport in July 2010 after more than 180,000 people signed an anti-bullfight petition. Hundreds of protesters stood outside Barcelona’s La Monumental arena, carrying signs that said “a great day for the bulls.” While six bulls were killed during Sunday’s event, La Monumental was the last arena in Catalonia still featuring bullfights, indicating that the ban has essentially already been adopted as the sport’s season came to an end this month. So far, Catalonia is Spain’s second region to ban bullfighting—the Canary Islands prohibited it in 1991—and animal-rights advocates are hopeful that other regions will follow suit after the ban takes effect in January.

FISH HABITATS AFFECT VIOLENCE,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/fish-habitats-affect-violence,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2011","A recent report published in Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science has found that aggression among fish increases when they are confined to barren, overcrowded aquariums. Conducted by Case Western Reserve University biology professor Ronald Oldfield, the study tested the influence of a number of environmental factors, such as number of competitors, amount of available space, and degree of habitat complexity, on the behavior of the Midas cichlid. Oldfield found that violent behavior was significantly reduced in larger, more enriched aquariums, and that tanks of typical fish hobbyists were not sufficient for optimum welfare. "
SCHOOL LUNCH POTATO BAN,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/school-lunch-potato-ban,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2011","Tater tots and French fries, long considered staples of school-cafeteria fare, may soon be absent from students’ plates. The US Department of Agriculture launched a proposal this year that would revamp lunch menus to include more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, but reduce the consumption of starch-heavy veggies, such as potatoes, corn, peas, and lima beans. The new criteria were drafted in accordance with the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which demands that the USDA base nutritional guidelines on science-based recommendations from the Institute of Medicine. If implemented, the new guidelines would go into effect next summer, but currently the USDA is reviewing more than 130,000 comments from supporters and opponents of the initiative. The Senate is also due to discuss the proposal in the coming months. "
DOG-EATING FEST BANNED,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/dog-eating-fest-banned,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2011","In Qianxi, a town in China’s Zhejiang province, a more than 600-year-old dog-eating festival has been cancelled this year after thousands of people took to social media in protest of the event. The festival celebrates a historical military victory, during which all of the town’s dogs were killed and eaten in order to prevent them from barking and alerting the enemy. Since the battle, the yearly celebration has included the killing, skinning, and butchering of dogs in Qianxi’s streets. This year, hoards of Chinese internet users expressed their disgust for the event, leading to the government’s cancellation of the cruel fête. China has recently seen an increased sympathy for animals; dog ownership was banned during the Cultural Revolution, but animal-companionship rates have risen over the past few decades. "
COMPASSIONATE BOARD GAME,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/compassionate-board-game,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2011","A California woman has designed Fur & Feathers, a new board game that teaches kids about their relationship with animals and the planet. Creator Chris Durant of Pleasant Hill, CA says that, while she’s not pushing a veg lifestyle on anyone, she wants to teach children that there are alternatives to animal products available. The game also touches on animal adoption, spaying and neutering, and the environmental impact of agriculture. Durant will donate 15 percent of the game’s proceeds to the Contra Costa County Animal Shelter and has another four games in the works. Durant tells Martinez Patch, “I hope children get time with their parents, become empowered to make healthy, compassionate choices, and have a really good time doing it.” "
GREEN PET PRODUCTS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/green-pet-products,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2011","As you’ve probably noticed, dogs and cats can’t read labels—or if they can, they’re hiding it really well. As a result, our companion animals need us to choose the best food, bedding, grooming tools, and cleaning products for their benefit as well as the benefit of the planet. Selecting organic, eco-friendly, all-natural and vegan animal-care products is just one more way of doing our best to maintain a cruelty-free and environmentally conscious lifestyle, while keeping our furry friends healthy and happy. Many natural-foods stores have dedicated aisles for organic and all-natural animal supplies, but online retailers can offer more in terms of variety and quality.  Sites like Simply Fido, Only Natural Pet Store, Natural Woof, My Eco Pets, and The Green Hound sell eco-friendly beds, treats, toys, collars, grooming aids, and waste-disposal bags, so there’s something sustainable for every pup or kitty. Green House
The days of doghouses made of chintzy plastic are long gone with the array of eco-friendly shelters on the market. New Age Pet’s ecoConcepts insulated dog bunk house is made from recycled post-consumer wood fibers and PVC, and is weather-resistant and moisture-proof to keep your pooch warm and cozy. Want to go to the next level with your sustainable pet home? Install a Doggie Dooley, an in-ground disposal system that uses natural bacteria and enzymes to reintegrate dog waste into a ground-absorbed liquid. For cats, check out the Cat Genie, which uses washable, biodegradable granules in place of strip-mined, pollutive traditional litter to provide a sustainable and hygienic alternative.  Finally, fluff up a green bed for Fido or Fluffy to lay their head upon. PoochPlanet beds are filled with ecoRest fiber, made from recycled plastic bottles, and come in four different varieties depending on your pup’s favorite sleeping position. PoochPlanet even makes therapeutic beds with extra cushioning, constructed from soy foam and reclaimed memory foam, that make counting sheep a dream. Their kitty counterparts, SmartyKat beds, are made with the same sustainable materials but with the added perk of organic catnip. Walk In the Park
Many dogs literally jump for joy at the invitation to go for a walk, but their owners are less thrilled at the prospect of cleaning up with plastic bags that will end up in a landfill. Harry Barker’s No. 2 Bags, complete with a recycled-plastic dispenser, are fully biodegradable, so they’ll compost in your heap or bin instead of stinking up your trashcan. Leashes and collars have also gone green, with an array of options made from hemp, bamboo, and other sustainable materials. Try Earthdoggy’s recycled-plastic Eton leash—it comes with a handy clip to attach your house keys and bag dispenser. Don’t forget to bring a toy to throw for your pup in the park—toss your mutt’s favorite ball with Planet Dog’s Wood Chuck, a thrower made from sustainable bamboo and reused cork scraps. Conscientious Kibble
Made evident by data from organizations like Environmental Working Group, meat production’s carbon emissions far surpass those of plant-based foods, and our companion animals’ dietary habits have an impact too. Fortunately, there are lots of veg formulas on the market that will keep your dog or cat healthy and full of energy without the harmful animal by-products found in many conventional foods. Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula kibble, made from brown rice, potatoes, peas, and oatmeal, has the same essential nutrients as its meaty counterparts, but is free of animal products. Dr. Harvey’s Veg-To-Bowl is a nutritious, vitamin-rich mix of 100-percent human-grade vegetables that any protein, such as tempeh, lentils, or beans, can be added to for a complete meal. Or, treat your canine to Nature’s Recipe Healthy Skin & Coat Vegetarian Recipe, a fortified vegan dry food that contains no meat, corn, wheat, or dairy, accommodating even the most sensitive of stomachs. Many veterinarians agree that dogs can thrive on a vegetarian or vegan diet, but meat-free diets for cats continue to be controversial due to their complex requirements for specific nutrients. There are a number of cat-food companies that claim to meet these needs, so if you’re interested in trying a veg regimen for your kitty, check out sites like VeganCats and Evolution Diet. They have an array of plant-based formulas that are worth investigating, but always start a new food plan with the advice of your veterinarian. Nearly every aspect of animal care can be covered using environmentally conscious materials and practices. Make your dog or cat proud by being conscientious and cruelty-free, for his or her sake and for the well-being of our planet and all of its creatures. "
VEG FOOD TRUCK,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/veg-food-truck,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2011","This October, a new veg food truck will be traveling around Fort Worth, TX, serving gourmet, gluten-free food. Business Operations Manager, Megan Topham, discovered her gluten intolerance in 2010 and wanted to open the restaurant-on-wheels to provide celiacs with flavorful, healthful options. While there is no official menu yet, Good Karma Kitchen has featured veg possibilities like futamaki (similar to sushi), tacos, Mile-High Chocolate Pie, banana cake, and Asian lettuce wraps on its Facebook page. The business has also donated a raffle prize to the Texas State Veggie Fair, taking place on October 23. "
FOOD POISONS PERUVIAN KIDS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/food-poisons-peruvian-kids,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2011","A poisoned school lunch has killed three children and sickened 89 other children and five adults in Peru. The meal of rice and fish was donated by the National Food Assistance Program to the school in Redondo, about 470 miles northwest of Lima. Due to the discovery of “carbonate intoxication” of the children, officials suspect that the food was accidentally prepared in a container that previously held rat poison. In 1999, a similar case occurred in Cuzco, Peru, when pesticide-contaminated food killed 24 children. "
TORONTO BANS PET MILLS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/toronto-bans-pet-mills,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2011","On Wednesday, the Toronto City Council voted unanimously to require that puppies and kittens sold in pet stores and at flea markets come exclusively from shelters, humane societies, or rescue groups. The measure was put in place to help alleviate the cruelty inherent in puppy and kitten mills, industries that often house the animals in small wire cages, causing numerous health problems, and then slaughter the animals after they stop breeding efficiently. Councilor Glen De Baeremaeker tells the Toronto Sun, “For all intents and purposes we’ve shut the taps of the puppy mills at retail locations in Toronto. We won’t eliminate them … those evil people will continue, but there is a lot less demand for their product.” The Toronto ban follows that of Richmond, British Columbia, which was the first city in Canada to institute the measures.

VEG MEN SEE HEALTH BENEFITS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/veg-men-see-health-benefits,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2011","A new study published in Nutrition & Metabolism has found that men who abide by a vegetarian diet have superior cardiovascular health to those who consume meat. Researchers in China compared 171 vegetarian Chinese men with 129 age-matched omnivorous men and reviewed a number of health factors. Their findings showed that the vegetarian men experienced a lower weight and body mass index, reduced blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and an overall decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, demonstrating that even in a country where rice and other plant foods are nutritional staples, even modest meat consumption can negatively impact health.

APRL is a nonprofit organization dedicated to exposing animal cruelty, educating the public on animal-welfare issues, and working towards more humane legislation. "
DAY-IN-THE-LIFE OF A VEGNEWS INTERN,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/day-in-the-life-of-a-vegnews-intern,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2011","I knew from several years spent reading VegNews Magazine, the VegNews blogs, and VegNews.com that the VN internship was most certainly on my horizon. How perfect is it to combine my passions for veganism, writing, and delicious food, in order to work for an ethically minded magazine? Somehow, I managed to come out on top as one of the chosen two, packed my bags for San Francisco, and settled in for six exciting months. As Editorial Assistants, my partner-in-crime and buddy Brooke Still and I do so much in a day that sometimes I can barely remember everything I spent the day doing. That is very much a good thing, since the job never gets old and the days fly by. Please join me for a day in the life of a VegNews intern! 8:00am: Feeling charged, I hop on my bike at my house near beautiful Golden Gate Park, and head down to the office on several of San Francisco’s many bike routes. The VegNews HQ is located in the Mission District of San Francisco, and it always blows my mind how a foggy, cloudy day where I live nearly always transforms into a bustling, sunny day in the Mission. 9:00am: I put on some tea water, boot up the computer, and check my email. Scanning Google alerts is generally the first order of the day, and Brooke and I chat about potential stories for the VegNews Daily stories we will be writing. 9:30am: It’s Monday, so everyone in the office gathers in our swanky conference room to discuss the week ahead. On the agenda: design meetings, editorial deadlines, a staff luncheon, a taste-test, and an upcoming vegan bake sale for local animal charities that I am helping organize. 10:00am: I make a few phone calls about the SF Vegan Bake Sale, then settle in to write two VegNews Daily’s for the website. Brooke does the same, and we swap our articles for proofing and fact-checking. Once they are looked over by Elizabeth, the managing editor, we post them to run the following day. 11:00am: I move on to two drafts that have appeared on my desk in the course of the morning. One is a food piece on insanely delicious-sounding Nepalese Momos that needs a proof—which is essentially the only thing that manages to distract me from my rumbling tummy reading about sumptuous Nepalese delights! 11:45am: Brooke and I meet with Elizabeth to discuss web content for the week. I’ve been mulling over pitches for features all weekend, and, to my delight, Elizabeth loves my ideas. I start researching a travel piece on my university town—Victoria, British Columbia—and contact vegan cookbook superstar and Victoria native Sarah Kramer for an interview. She responds right away, and we agree to an email interview later in the day. It’s so exciting to be communicating with some of the vegans I’ve admired for so long! 12:30pm: Oh gosh—how on earth did 12:30 get here? Lunchtime! Office Manager and my frequent lunch date Lyndsay Orwig and I jump on our bikes and grab scrumptious vegan tuna melts from a place nearby called Gestalt to eat in the sun at the famed Dolores Park. Chatting with a great friend, eating delicious sandwiches, and enjoying the view of this gorgeous city by the Bay? Amazing. I make sure to photograph our meals because I have been scheduled today to write the Café VegNews blog, one of my favorite tasks. We return to the office relaxed, satisfied, and perhaps even slightly more tanned. 1:30pm: Time for some blogging! I am in charge of our new product blog This Just In, which means I get to be the one to open boxes filled with wondrous delights—from vegan tamales, new vegan makeup palettes, and the hottest new vegan cookbook to less predictable shipments like reusable glass drinking straws—I relish the daily surprises. I photograph today’s delivery (vegan queso and raw cookies!) and write both the Café VegNews and This Just In blogs. 2:00pm: Sutton Long, our lovely long-time art director who is becoming a good friend of mine since we live in the same neighborhood, arrives at the office for our scheduled design meeting (she works from home). Most of the staff partakes in admiring Sutton’s incredibly creative layouts of an issue that seems to be coming together almost mysteriously, and we all offer constructive criticism about what is and isn’t working for us. I love these meetings and feel honored that my opinion is valued, plus it’s great to think visually about a story. Sutton has been busy and our press deadline is impending, so our meeting lasts for nearly two hours, even though time seems to fly by. 4:00pm: I start working on a vegan Halloween candy guide I’ve been asked to update and fact-check. Though some of the candy brands’ websites appear to be mildly seizure-inducing, fact-checking is a breeze now that more and more companies provide up-to-date, accurate information about allergens such as dairy products. 4:45pm: Brooke has been scheduled to arrange and write the Taste Test column for the issue we’re currently working on, so I agree to help her get the blind tasting set up for our 5-o’clock libations! Yes, libations, as this issue’s taste test is for all-vegan hard ciders! We set up the tasting, before realizing that everyone in the office has arrived astutely punctual for the agreed-upon 5pm happy hour—or rather—very serious product testing. 5:00pm: Yummy. Whilst sipping the best-of-the-best in the world of vegan cider, I reflect on how hilarious, creative, and intelligent my coworkers are. It’s not the cider talking when I say that I am truly privileged to be part of such an environment. 5:25pm: The day has flown by, but I head back to my desk to finish up my email for the day. Hey, when you’re going back and forth with Sarah Kramer, you don’t slack off! Sarah has completed all of my interview questions in her usual charming manner, and when I finally shut down my computer and hop back on my bike, I’m still formulating an outline for my travel piece and look forward to drafting it up tomorrow.

IVY LEAGUE AR VIOLATIONS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/ivy-league-ar-violations,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2011","Earlier this month, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine released a list ranking Ivy League universities on their adherence to the Animal Welfare Act. The researchers found that all of the highly-regarded universities had research facilities with a disturbing number of violations, including a dead newborn puppy under a kennel-floor gate, primates deprived of water for more than 24 hours, and burned, blistered baboons. The worst misconduct score was 120, attributed to the University of Pennsylvania, followed by Princeton and Yale Universities with a tied score of 49. PCRM recommends that animals be removed completely from experiments and that universities be held responsible for their violations. "
PEPSI’S CHICKPEA PROJECT,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/pepsis-chickpea-project,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2011","PepsiCo, better known for cola and chips than healthy legumes, is joining forces with the United Nation’s World Food Programme and US Agency for International Development to launch EthioPEA, a program that aims to increase chickpea production in Ethiopia. The project’s goals are to enable 10,000 Ethiopian farmers to double their chickpea yield with modernized agricultural practices, strengthen the nation’s economy with greater chickpea exports, and develop the legume into a locally sourced, nutrient-rich food supplement. If initial testing of the supplement is successful, the company will spend $1 million to buy the product and distribute it to 40,000 malnourished children over the course of one year. The company also plans to use the program as a means of securing a supply of chickpeas for Sabra hummus, which it co-owns with Israel’s Strauss Group Inc, as well as for a potential chickpea-based product to eventually sell in Ethiopian stores. Unfortunately, the program will not be able to sufficiently resolve the devastating famine currently affecting Africa. "
MEATY FLAVOR FROM MUSHROOMS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/meaty-flavor-from-mushrooms,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2011","A team of Chinese and American scientists have developed a fermentation technique to produce meaty flavors from oyster mushrooms. Published in the International Journal of Food Science & Technology, the findings from the experiment could result in a mass-produced, cruelty-free natural meat-flavor additive for foods. The researchers added amino acids and sugars to 15 samples of oyster mushrooms and heat-treated the samples to find six major flavor attributes—meaty, sweet, earthy, musty, sulphuric pungent, and burnt sugar—and then isolated the meaty flavor. “The utilizations of edible mushroom mycelia for the product of natural flavor compounds can have great benefits to consumers and food and flavor industry,” says the report.

DOCTORS URGE PLANT-BASED DIET,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/doctors-urge-plant-based-diet,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2011","The World Preservation Foundation has released a report titled “Plant-Based Diets: A Solution to Our Public Health Crisis,” urging the British government to take the lead in promoting plant-based diets. Led by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, the report argues that many serious illnesses, such as heart disease, obesity, cancer, and diabetes, are preventable through the implementation of plant-based eating, with disease rates potentially decreasing by 75 percent if the public were to make the change. Collaborator Dr. Joel Fuhrman, of the National Health Association, comments in the report, “New dietary guidelines emphasizing nutrient-rich plant foods can enable modern populations to dramatically improve their health, dramatically reduce healthcare costs, while at the same time save millions of needless deaths from heart disease, strokes, cancer, and diabetes.” "
SILK BOOSTS CALCIUM,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/silk-boosts-calcium,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2011","After the USDA’s 2010 Dietary Guidelines labeled calcium a “nutrient of concern,” Silk has decided to boost the calcium content in its products to be 50 percent higher than that of dairy milk. One eight-ounce serving of plain Silk will now have 45 percent of the daily recommended amount of calcium, whereas prior to the announcement, it had 30 percent, equal to a typical serving of dairy milk. Vegan author Kathy Freston, the spokesperson for the campaign, says of the change, “Now that Silk’s soymilk line contains 50 percent more calcium than typical dairy milk, it is an easy and delicious way to help people meet their daily calcium requirements while getting all the benefits of plant-based nutrition.” "

Vegan Co-owners Jason Gottfried and Carlo Besozzi say the reason behind the switch is to fill a growing need for an entirely vegan restaurant in the Gainesville community. Book Lover’s Café serves a variety of internationally inspired dishes, such as African lentils, Thai peanut noodles, and Inca quinoa with veggies. “One of our main goals is to become more community-oriented,” Gottfried says in The Independent Florida Alligator. “I hope that the vegan community will enjoy and support us and help us transform this place into something fantastic.” "
VEGAN ETSY SUPERSTARS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/vegan-etsy-superstars,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2011","Sometimes, you just want to nosh on something homemade, a sweet treat crafted with care.

Alas, homemade superstars of Etsy enter the scene; with the site’s passionate, dedicated community of sellers baking creative treats in their kitchens every day, your craving for all things homemade and veg will soon be satiated by a trip to your mailbox.  Mmm Marshmallows
Gourmet vegan marshmallows are the rage on Etsy, dotting the pages with fluffy, white-as-snow puffs that look so good, you’ll want to pluck them right off the screen. For the classic sugar-dusted variety, seller SweetVegan makes original vanilla marshmallows by hand and in small batches, so customers know the ‘mallows are fresh and made with love. Plop one in a mug of spicy Mexican hot chocolate from AproposRoasters and you’ll never go back to store-bought cocoa mixes. On the other hand, seller DesiderioChocolates takes her marshmallows to the next level with the “gourmellow”—half marshmallow, half chocolate ganache truffle, and wholly mind-blowing, not to mention the entire creation comes dipped in rich, dark chocolate.  Cupcake Coma
Search Etsy for “vegan” and try not to crave a cupcake—the ubiquitous sweets are some of the most popular veganized offerings. Etsy goes beyond the classic vanilla cupcake; get ready to sample to-die-for vegan cupcake flavors from baked goods store Miss Vegan, like campfire (vanilla buttercream frosting, marshmallows, chocolate, and graham crackers), pumpkin maple, cotton candy (topped with turquoise frosting), and even orange creamsicle. Bonus—they even come with that satisfying feeling of homemade achievement, as buyers apply the frosting themselves. Miss Vegan was founded in 2007, and the seller is hoping to expand into a food truck in the future.

Cinnamon-chili-blood orange, cardamom-pistachio, and apricot-lemon-ginger flavors just scrape the surface of what this creative chocolate artist can do. Feeling royal?

WEST HOLLYWOOD BANS FUR,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/west-hollywood-bans-fur,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2011","It’s official—the city of West Hollywood has become the first city in the US to ban the sale of fur apparel. The ban, which will prohibit the sale of apparel made from the pelt or skin of an animal with hair, wool, or fur, received unanimous approval from the city council in a 5-0 vote. An additional 120 people also gave their names in support to be recorded by the council. Councilmember John D’Amico, a proponent of the measure, proposed that the ban should start June 30 of next year, but the date has yet to be made official. Before the ordinance can receive final approval, it must be given a second reading. The ban would add another layer of protection to the already animal-friendly city, which has prohibited the declawing of cats, cosmetic testing on animals, steel-jaw leghold traps, and puppy mills. "
COMBATTING FOOD INSECURITY IN THE US,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/combatting-food-insecurity-in-the-us,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2011","Combine the rising costs of just about everything, especially food, with limited access to healthful food and it becomes easy to understand why so many people in the US have poor health. According to a recent report from the Census Bureau, more than 46 million people—nearly one in six Americans—are impoverished. While the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that, from July 2010 to July 2011, Americans experienced a 3.6 percent increase on the price of all items on average, food costs rose even higher; the cost of food overall rose 4.2 percent, while the price of food at home increased even higher by 5.4 percent. This leaves many American families wondering how to afford next week’s groceries. In fact, nearly 15 percent of households experienced food insecurity, meaning “limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways,” in 2008, up 3.5 percent from the year before. Even if people can afford fresh food, new research shows that some may not even have access to it: At least 23.5 million people in the US live in “food deserts,” more than 6,500 places that have a substantial low-income population with low-access to supermarkets. These statistics alone begin to unravel a complex web of problems Americans face when trying to eat healthfully. While the statistics give a grim outlook, grassroots organizations, government programs, and independent projects have begun developing strategies and implementing programs to help Americans access and consume more fresh fruits and vegetables.  A Growing Solution
While the economy isn’t growing, vegetable gardens surely are, both in backyards and in community plots. From 2008 to 2009, the number of US households with food gardens increased from 36 million to 43 million, with around 21 percent of the gardening households in 2009 claiming to be new to the practice. Food gardens are a solid investment as well—in 2008, the total nationwide expenditure on food gardens was $2.5 billion, while the return value of the investment totaled $21 billion worth of produce. Additionally, gardening has been linked to increased fruit and vegetable intake among older adults. La Mesa Verde, a gardening group of Sacred Heart Community Service, is one group of dozens working to help families struggling with low income, long-term unemployment, and working poverty. La Mesa Verde provides participating families in San Jose, CA with all of the materials needed to grow organic gardens, such as raised beds, soil, drip irrigation systems, and seeds. Intending to improve health, well-being, and self-sufficiency, the program connects families with gardeners knowledgeable of the crops that grow best in San Jose’s climate. Founder Raul Lozano says, “The issue of self-sufficiency is a big one. If you are not self-sufficient as a person or a family, if you don’t have that self determination or sense of opportunity, then you are at the whim of cycles whether they are economic, social, or political.” In San Francisco, limited lawn space has turned many produce-deprived residents to neighborhood gardens. In 2004, the city’s Recreation and Park Department determined that 47 percent of households have need for more community gardens. The Park Department currently supports and manages 35 community gardens, some of which are entirely communal, while others provide private lots for individuals. Volunteers at many of these gardens lead classes on how to grow vegetables, giving low-income families greater access to healthy food. Some volunteer gardeners also sell their produce at local markets, increasing availability even further. Community gardens are proven to be a great way to bring fresh food to communities that otherwise might not have it. Government Steps Up
Recently, the government has stepped up to address the imminent problem. Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move program specifically works to decrease obesity rates in American children, but has also made progress in food deserts. In July, the First Lady teamed up with national grocers like Wal-Mart, Walgreens, and Supervalu, as well as regional chains, to open or expand more than 1,500 new stores neighborhoods with low-income or little access to fresh food. Wal-Mart also pledged to remodel some supermarkets to make more retail space for fresh food. “The commitments that you all are making today have the potential to be a game changer for our kids and for our communities all across this country,” Michelle Obama said to the retailers in a press conference announcing the new plans. Additionally, the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service has begun working with farmers’ markets to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, known to many as food stamps, from customers. This new partnership has opened more doors, as local groups have funded programs that increase the value of SNAP dollars spent at farmers’ markets. The farmers’ market in Belmont, a suburb of Boston where the number of residents receiving SNAP benefits has more than doubled in the past three years, now doubles every dollar up to $25 each week from those spending their benefits at the market. “There’s a big, big push right now to get fresh food into the mouths of people who might have trouble getting it otherwise,” said Suzanne Johannet, a manager at the market, to The Boston Globe. In 2010, nearly 60 Massachusetts farmers’ markets offered the double dollars program. Massachusetts isn’t the only state with the program; from Alachua County, FL and Lewiston, ME, to Tifton, GA and Adams County, PA, the double dollars programs are springing up at farmers’ markets across the US, depending on where and when funding is available. Quenching a Desert Drought
Contrary to popular belief, 82 percent of those in food deserts actually reside in urban areas. One nonprofit working to provide urban-dwellers with fresh food is Arcadia. In October, residents of Washington, DC should look out for Arcadia’s new Mobile Market Project, a school bus transformed into a biodiesel-powered farmers’ market on wheels. The bus will sell produce grown at Arcadia’s educational farm at prices that rival or beat average farmers’ market prices. “The whole idea for this bus is to work myself out of a job,” Mobile Market manager Benjamin Bartley told The Huffington Post. “I want to come into these neighborhoods, cultivate the demand where there isn’t access to food, and then hopefully corner stores or grocery stores can take that baton and continue supplying that demand.” Enter Market Makeovers, an organization working to turn corner stores in food deserts into health-food oases. The group provides both customers and business owners with tools to increase health-food inventory, implement new marketing and promotions, evaluate progress, and more. While the group is based in south Los Angeles, its website archives the tool kits for easy access nationwide. Another group working to quench the fresh-food drought is Stockbox Grocers. Funded via Kickstarter, Stockbox refurbishes reclaimed shipping containers into mini-stores chock full of farm-fresh produce. The stores will be placed in existing parking lots in food deserts, such as the Delridge neighborhood of Seattle. Most Delridge residents who want healthy food need to travel on public transportation for 45 minutes to the nearest grocery store, but fortunately will begin having access to the very first Stockbox this fall. The program’s founders are hoping to determine the needs of the community, then work to bring Stockboxes to other food deserts across the US. With the government’s greater recognition of the food accessibility and affordability problem, federal organizations and grassroots groups have banded together to solve this crisis. While these programs are certainly providing residents of their communities increased access to affordable, healthy food, more help is needed for those facing food insecurity. "

Harvard’s version incorporates the latest in scientific research, addressing what the school calls “important deficiencies” in the USDA’s suggestions. For example, the Harvard plate encourages consumers to limit dairy, limit red and processed meats, and avoid sugary beverages, all of which conflict with MyPlate. Additionally, it does not consider potatoes to be one of its recommended vegetables, due to their high starch content. In their press release, HSPH adds, “a plant-based diet rich in vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and healthy proteins lowers the risk of weight gain and chronic disease.” "

No Worries started as a catering business in the late 1990s before moving into its restaurant space. Due to the economy, the team of owners decided that they would be better able to offer their food with a mobile business. The No Worries truck will serve similar foods to those of the former restaurant, such as items like soy chicken adobo, fried vegan shrimp, and Sinigange, a tamarind-based sour soup with veggies.

While the organization currently has a limited medical facility at its sanctuary in Watkins Glen, NY, it lacks the facilities needed to care for badly injured animals. The Small Animal Hospital will allow the caregivers to provide hands-on emergency response right at the sanctuary, as opposed to bringing the animals nearly 30 miles away to Cornell University Hospital for Animals for treatment, which can be dangerous for those in a fragile state. “These animals come to us in such bad shape and this will allow us to give them the care that they need and treat them as the individuals that they are, which is what Farm Sanctuary represents,” says National Shelter Director Susie Coston. Farm Sanctuary hopes to raise $754,000 in donations in order to complete the project. "
NETHERLANDS VEG BUTCHER CHAIN,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/netherlands-veg-butcher-chain,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2011","A chain of vegetarian butcher shops is rapidly expanding in the Netherlands, where the demand for meat alternatives is rising as 87 percent of citizens no longer eat meat on a daily basis and two-thirds of the population sees meat as a luxury, rather than a necessity. The Vegetarian Butcher—or De Vegetarische Slager in Dutch—has grown from one storefront to being sold in more than 30 locations in less than a year, offering faux chicken, bacon, gyros, sausage, and more to the masses. Founded by Niko Koffeman and organic farmer Jaap Korteweg, the company aims to provide sustainable meat alternatives with superior flavor and texture.  Koffeman estimates that 80 percent of the shop’s clients are vegans and vegetarians, but the company hopes to convert people who want to reduce or completely omit meat from their diets. “Animal cruelty is one reason, but also a growing concern for sustainability,” Koffeman says. “After all, meat production is highly inefficient.” "
VEGAN CHOREOGRAPHER JAMES KORONI,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/vegan-choreographer-james-koroni,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2011","“A voice for the voiceless” is a phrase that we hear often within the animal-welfare movement, but what if that voice was able to convey a message without using words? Vegan choreographer James Koroni uses his love of dance as a form of activism through his creation and curation of Enforced Arch, a group of performers who are using the power of their movements to create dialogue about big issues like animal welfare and social justice. VegNews chatted with Koroni about his passions, his anti-fur project, and his favorite vegan munchies.    VegNews: What made you decide to go vegan?
James Koroni: I was raised in Orange County, where I was never exposed [to veganism]. Then, when I moved to San Francisco for college, there was so much more of an influence from my friends. I worked at this teahouse that was all about health and a community around food. At the same time, my father was sick with cancer and I felt like [veganism’s] health benefits would be able to help him. He was always eating fast food, and not really thinking about what he ate as a source of health. VN: So many people don’t consider that the foods that we choose could have such a great effect on our health, our psyche, and our personal well-being. How did that realization affect you?
JK: It made me find this new interest in food and where it came from, and through that I explored macrobiotics, raw food, vegan food in general. I moved back to Los Angeles and worked at a raw-food vegan restaurant called Taste of the Goddess and later at Real Food Daily. During that time, I made the transition [to veganism] because of volunteering for Vegan Vixens in Los Angeles. They were talking about the animal-cruelty element of what we eat, and from volunteering with them, and also [from] the passing of my father, I realized how important it is to really be conscious of what we eat and where it’s coming from, Not only from the health side, but also the cruelty that’s involved. VN: How did that tie into your budding desire to express yourself through dance?
JK: I started dancing at 18 or 19, around when I actually started becoming vegan. Before that I was a singer my whole life, and I thought that was actually what I was going to do. I had always been a silly dancer at the clubs—well, at the Mormon dances, because I was raised Mormon. Mormon dances: you can be silly there! I was like, why am I not doing this? I’d always loved to dance. Then, I took a few classes in college, studied at Edge in Los Angeles, and moved to New York, I felt like that was where all of my passions could come together into one. VN: A lot of the themes that you explore in your choreography relate to topics like power, vulnerability, and struggle. What are the main things that you want to evoke when you choreograph pieces?
JK: I want to be able to reach as many people as possible because the messages that I’m trying to communicate—they carry a lot of weight. I think that everyone, in their private life, is silly. I wanted to add an element of that so people [think], “Oh, that’s what I do in my living room.” Quirky elements, but also that technical side so it’s almost like it’s coming from this hero, with the eccentric costuming. In terms of the message, my [second] piece, “Arrest Yourself,” was about how people don’t realize the tiny little things in their daily lives are what make the big difference, like not taking a bag to the grocery store or putting a little bit of cream in your [coffee] instead of soymilk, and not realizing what you’re contributing to. My latest piece, “Please Don’t Touch,” is about animals used for fur, and it was an artistic contribution to Pinnacle, the anti-fur initiative. We created these pants that made us look like satyrs, half-human and half-animal, to let the audience see that [animals] live lives much like our own. This piece really tries to give you a first-hand experience. I hope that people who aren’t vegan or don’t know anything about fur will be able to wonder now—what is going on with fur? And they can go research about it for themselves after seeing this piece. VN: You were invited to perform “Please Don’t Touch” at Paris Vegan Day, and have started an Indiegogo project to fund the trip. How do you think people in other countries will respond to the piece?
JK: We’re very interested in doing that because I think that this piece can be performed all over the place and we can create relationships with other dancers in other parts of the world and, hopefully, make a stand. I see so many performance pieces in the dance community that don’t [incorporate] a message. Why can’t it be just as fun and exciting, but also mean something behind that? Everyone loves dancing, so why couldn’t it also be a form of activism as well as a form of entertainment? [Dance] is a universal language. VN: What other kinds of activism and issues does Enforced Arch, your dance group, address?
JK: I seek out professional dancers who also do side projects in activist work. A lot of the dancers are vegan. There are other artists such as Nicole Johnson, who has a nonprofit called MOVE, which stands for Motivation Opportunity Vision Entertainment. She dances and puts on shows to raise money for building schools in Cambodia. And there’s Bettina May, who’s a burlesque dancer. She’s vegan and she makes all of her own costuming so that she doesn’t have to use any feathers or fur. And there’s Tonya Kay, who travels and works with endangered species—more specifically, elephants—and is a raw-food vegan. Others are dancing for gay rights, such as Tracy Katof, who works for the It Gets Better Project. VN: As a dancer, you have to stay in great shape. What are your favorite vegan snacks to keep you energized?
JK: Brooklyn Kombucha is my favorite beverage to drink when I am out and about. I eat a lot of organic baby carrots. One of my favorite indulgences is the Gardein Chipotle Lime Crispy Fingers for protein. I put them on arugula, with Goddess dressing. When I’m in a big hurry, I eat Clif Builder Bars or ProBars. Don’t miss “Please Don’t Touch,” which is available to watch online at Koroni’s Indiegogo site. "

FEDS EXTEND E. COLI STRAIN BAN,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/feds-extend-e-coli-strain-ban,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2011","The US Department of Agriculture announced this week that it will be extending its ban of E. coli in ground beef to include six additional strains of the deadly bacteria, in order to decrease the consumer risk of foodborne illness. Prior to the new measure, it was legal to sell meat containing these types of E. coli under the premise that they would be destroyed during the cooking process, but in recent years, many people have fallen ill from eating undercooked and tainted ground beef. The most well-known strain of the bacteria, E. coli O157:H7, has been banned from ground beef since 1994, when it sickened hundreds of people and killed four children. In order to give the meat industry time to prepare for the recent initiative, the USDA will not begin enforcing the new rule until March 2012. While consumer-advocate groups are hailing the new rule, the beef industry has deemed it unnecessary and warned that prices will rise as a consequence. "
CONGRESS SAYS NO TO GM SALMON,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/congress-says-no-to-gm-salmon,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2011","Members of Congress are working to prevent the FDA from approving genetically engineered salmon for human consumption. Massachusetts-based company AquaBounty designed its salmon to grow twice as quickly as wild salmon. Congress members from Alaska are leading the opposition, saying that the engineered fish will damage the state’s wild salmon industry, but more than a dozen senators have written to the FDA about their concerns with the related food-safety and environmental risks. Approval of the modified salmon would open the door for other genetically modified organisms, such as the “Enviropig” being developed in Canada, which promises to have less-polluting manure, or cattle resistant to mad cow disease.

Q&A WITH VEGUCATED’S MARISA MILLER WOLFSON,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/qandampa-with-vegucateds-marisa-miller-wolfson,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2011","Last weekend, filmmaker Marisa Miller Wolfson premiered her documentary Vegucated at the Toronto Independent Film Festival to an audience of more than 400 people—a crowd which doubled the attendance record of any other film at the festival. The feature-length film tracks the lives of three meat-loving New Yorkers during their pledge to adopt a vegan diet for six weeks. VN caught up with the globe-trotting filmmaker just before the festival. VegNews: What are you most excited for this weekend?
Marisa Miller Wolfson: Most people would say [they’re most excited] to see their film on the big screen, but that’s not it for me. For me, it’s hearing the audience while watching the film, seeing where they laugh, listening to where I hear sniffles—that’s the most exciting part. VN: A lot of people have already seen the film. What has been the response so far?
MMW: We’ve had three sneak-peek screenings this summer, but just at conferences. [The response] has been tremendous. People are just really glad to have a film that they can share with family and friends that doesn’t scream “go vegan or die.” They’re not showing them a film that’s going to bring their hearts to the floor. There’s a place for that and we do have some of that in the film, but we balance it out with humor. I think the biggest response is that people appreciate the humor, which I think makes this film a little bit special.  VN: Would you say that your film creates some common ground between vegans and non-vegans?
MMW: I think so, that’s a really great way of putting it. At the end, it isn’t all or nothing. Obviously I want people to go vegan, but we want to applaud people wherever they are in their process and feeling they’re part of the solution no matter where they are in their own vegolution. We want to cheer people on. When people say that they’re doing Meatless Mondays, we say great! They might say they’re doing vegan taco Tuesdays, and we say fabulous!  VN: Are you still in touch with the subjects of your film?
MMW: I am still in touch with them, actually. I’m so glad about it. Ellen lives a few blocks away from me now and we do meet up for brunch regularly and I meet up with her daughter Debbie, as well. They come to my house for parties, we go out and have ice cream. It’s really nice. I am in touch with Tesla online. She probably has the least support out of everyone, so she’s struggling the most. Brian is doing great; he’s out in California, having a ball and he’s lost so much weight even since we’ve finished the project; it’s amazing.   VN: Can fans of your film help schedule screenings in their towns? 
MMW: Heck yea! The theatrical screenings are trickier. We had someone on Facebook tell us about calling their local theater and urging them to show the film. While that’s great, I don’t know if that’s going to work. I think the best thing that people can do if they want to get the film shown in their town is to sign up to hold a community screening next year. We’re launching our community screenings campaign in January and we’re going to have a whole screening kit. Folks can either show it in their living rooms as part of a house party-potluck event or they can show it at their school, yoga studio, or community center. Or if they want to show it in a theater they have a relationship with, that’s fine, too. We’ll work with people in any situation they want to show the film.  VN: That sounds like a great way to connect with your viewers.
MMW: Well, we made this as a grassroots outreach tool. It is going to be quite usable because the tone is so positive and it is so comprehensive. It covers a lot of ground and it’s still entertaining. I don’t know of too many films that cover all the reasons for being vegan, like health, animals, human rights, and the environment. But ours does, and it crams it all in to 75 minutes while telling personal stories of transformation.   VN: How do you think Vegucated will impact the vegan movement? 
MMW: It’s another tool in the toolbox and while not everyone will sit down and read a book, a lot of people will sit down and watch a film. Having made one, I know how much work they are, and now I know why there are so few vegan feature documentaries out there. We’re just glad to be able to add to the list of really great outreach tools.  "

5 AMAZING BURGER JOINTS WE LOVE,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/5-amazing-burger-joints-we-love,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2011","From Singapore to Cincinnati, restaurants are incorporating international flavors to create tasty, cruelty-free burgers, charred to perfection. With so many burgers around, narrowing down the list to five was difficult, but that’s just the kind of challenge we love. Loving Hut
Each of the chain’s more than 120 worldwide locations develops its own unique menu, making burgers at Loving Hut an exploration in regional flavors. Head to the Sunshine State for the Orlando Loving Hut’s Aloha Burger, which doubles the fun with two vegan patties, fresh tomato and lettuce, veg mayo, and a slice of grilled pineapple. Honolulu’s franchise serves the simple yet flavorful Teri Burger, which fills two whole wheat buns with a tangy teriyaki patty and all the fixings. Ledgewood, New Jersey spices up the East Coast with a Crispy Chipotle Burger, featuring a flash-fried battered soy patty loaded with fresh veggies, smooth guacamole, and chipotle mayo. Or, try a veganized version of a Midwestern favorite—the Sloppy Joe—with coleslaw and organic corn chips in Cincinnati, Ohio. Native Foods Café
With this chain’s recent expansion, customers can nosh on Native Foods’ burgers throughout Southern California and now Chicago. Combining two kinds of veggie burgers, the portobello and sausage burger towers with caramelized onions, roasted garlic, grilled mushroom, homemade seitan, and a creamy pumpkin seed pesto. Fall in love with the Oklahoma Bacon Cheeseburger, perfected with melted cheddar and slathered with a generous serving of barbecue sauce and ranch dressing. How they manage to stuff all of the fixings—lettuce, carrots, onions, tomatoes, and battered dill pickle chips—into a whole grain bun is a gastronomic mystery worth investigating. VeganBurg
Boasting an extensive list of creative, gourmet vegan burgers, Singapore’s VeganBurg makes it impossible to choose just one favorite. You’ll be saying aloha after just one bite of the Hawaiian Pineapple Burger—juicy grilled pineapple atop a soy patty glazed with sweet plum sauce, all between a crusty bun with crisp lettuce. The seasonal Curry Rendang Burger kicks it up with a pan-grilled marinated mushroom patty, yellow onions, tomato, and spicy Indonesian Rendang sauce, traditionally made with ginger, turmeric, lemongrass, and chilies, in an organic rye bun. Consider one of the eatery’s creative accompaniments for your grilled treat; perhaps some seaweed fries or crispy potato-spinach pops? VeganBurg puts a whole new spin on fast food.  Veggie Grill
Serving veg chicken steaks, carne asada, tangy wings and more, Veggie Grill lives up to its name as the Mecca of grilled vegan food. Give the V-Burger—made with marinated veggie-steak burgers, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle ranch, and pickles—a whirl if you crave a traditional grilled sandwich. The Bali Bliss burger puts an Indonesian spin on the American classic with sautéed and grilled tempeh, lettuce, red onion, chipotle ranch, and avocado—request it blackened for the most authentic flavor. For an healthier option, all of the burgers can be served on a bed of crunchy kale, sans bun.  Veg-N-Out
In San Diego, Veg-N-Out grills up an impressive menu of nearly a dozen gourmet veg burger options with add-ons like sliced avocado, sautéed mushrooms, and zesty jalapeños. For starters, the Ultimate Vegan Burger manages to cram a slew of vegan favorites, like Follow-Your-Heart cheddar and mozzarella, Veganaise, sprouts, cucumbers, tomatoes, pickles, and onions, onto a crusty wheat bun. Veg-N-Out also smothers patties with homemade chili, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes for a cruelty-free Chili Cheese Burger. Grab some friends and share 3 Little Birds, three sliders topped with sautéed onions, and served with assorted top-it-yourself add-ons like lettuce, tomato, pickles, barbecue sauce, and mustard for custom creations. Be sure to request the vegan cheese to complete the burger.  "
TURKEY CONTAMINATION RECURS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/turkey-contamination-recurs,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2011","Just more than a month after recalling 36 million pounds of ground turkey due to a salmonella outbreak, food manufacturer Cargill was forced to suspend production and issue a second recall this week after more traces of the deadly bacteria were found in meat from the same Arkansas plants. The new recall covers about 185,000 pounds of product. The outbreak that led to the previous recall, which was issued on August 3, sickened 107 people in 31 states, and killed one. Cargill spokesperson Mike Martin said that after the first recall, equipment was disassembled and steam-cleaned, and two antibacterial washes were added to the processing line in what he called “the most advanced sampling and monitoring system in the poultry industry.” However, a sample taken on August 24 tested positive for the same strain of salmonella found last month.

VEG-HEAVY DIET CUTS CANCER RISK,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/veg-heavy-diet-cuts-cancer-risk,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2011","A recent study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology has found that women who follow a plant-based diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains have a significantly lower risk of developing breast cancer, as opposed to those on an animal-based diet. Using data collected over 26 years by researchers from Simmons College, the report followed more than 86,600 women in different diet groups and the correlation with their risk of developing postmenopausal breast cancer. Women who were on the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, which recommends four to five servings of fruits and veggies per day as well as four to five servings of legumes, nuts, and seeds each week, were found to have a 20 percent lower risk for developing estrogen receptor-negative tumors, which account for about 25 percent of breast cancer cases. In the past, plant-based diets have also been shown to lower the risk of developing colon cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia. "
ECO-FRIENDLY FASHION SITE,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/eco-friendly-fashion-site,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2011","The daily eco-fashion blog Magnifeco is now providing readers with a new way to buy cruelty-free clothing via its companion shopping portal, magnifecoshopping.com. Launched last week by Toronto-native Kate Black, Magnifeco Shopping offers eco-friendly clothing, shoes, accessories, and beauty products for women, focusing on items that are vegan, fair-trade, recycled, sustainable, and organic. Black was inspired to launch the site after reading a survey in the Guardian that showed that 69 percent of UK adults polled would be more likely to buy ethical clothing if it was more widely stocked. Magnifeco Shopping creates a “Look of the Week,” complete with shoes, handbags, makeup, clothes, and accessories, and works with popular vendors like ModCloth and Zappos to provide customers with the latest in eco-friendly fashion.

COMPASSIONATE FASHION,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/compassionate-fashion,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2011","Trends may change faster than the colors of the leaves, but there’s no better time than fall to spruce up your wardrobe using inspiration from the season’s cutting-edge collections. This year, vegan fashion is more of-the-moment, luxurious, and affordable than ever before. Here are some of the season’s sartorial essentials, and the cruelty-free picks you’ll need to get the look.  Seeing Brights
Although blustery autumn days are often associated with earth tones and neutrals, statement-making splashes of color are all over the fall 2011 runways. To brighten your look without channeling Cyndi Lauper on hallucinogens, mix one boldly hued piece into an otherwise subdued outfit. Try Alternative Apparel’s organic-cotton Slummy Tee Dress in crimson for a pop of primary red, or indulge in vegan label Vaute Couture’s Emily Coat in emerald. Its warm, weatherproof, and eco-friendly design will make it a staple of your closet as temperatures decline in the winter months. If you have extra moolah (and confidence), turn heads by pairing these brick-red Stella McCartney corduroy pants with a simple cream-colored top. Tough Break
Designers like Givenchy, Chloé, and Marc Jacobs have fashion blogs buzzing about their leather skirts, but what about those of us who seek the punk-sophisticate look without wearing animal products? Bohemian clothiers Free People have created a new collection of vegan leather items, including an edgy but feminine pleated skirt, that have the slick aesthetic without the ethical conundrum. Don’t forget to accessorize: motorcycle-style ankle boots from NeuAura offer a tough but wearable look from the ankle down, or carry your wares in Matt & Nat’s menswear-inspired faux-leather briefcase. Want the rock ‘n’ roll vibe without going synthetic? Try an effortlessly cool bamboo-cotton blend Joan Jacket by Device, available from Ethical Ocean. Gimme the Boot
It’s boot season! Shopping for non-leather boots used to be a drag, but more and more designers are crafting vegan versions that are both sturdy and hip. Cruelty-free footwear label Olsenhaus’s lookbook for this season is full of modern, provocative styles like the Andromeda, which has a hidden wedge, and the Millennium, which has a Blade Runner vibe. Cri de Couer also makes avant-garde but wearable pieces, like over-the-knee flat boots and peep-toe platforms. Mainstream designers have also jumped on the leather-free bangwagon; Jeffrey Campbell recently released a collection of vegan styles, including a revamped Lita boot (now known as the “Vita”), and Charles David also debuted a special line of $99 vegan boots at this year’s Fashion’s Night Out event in New York. The Velveteen Habit
This year, velvet and velour have been making their way into everything from jackets and hats to shorts and leggings. Romantic yet simple, this versatile textile can be worn a number of ways. Melding concepts of hard and soft, Corpus’s velvet moto jacket will look great with or without a Harley. Vaute Couture’s revamped Vaute Coat is made from zero-waste recycled satin ripstop, but has a velvety feel and flattering A-line shape to boot. My Pet Square’s velvet Bustle Dress is perfect for a holiday party or a night out on the town, or pair Boutique’s velvet shorts with knit tights and your favorite cozy sweater. You can even keep things super-casual with some velvet Keds! Plaid About You
Tartans and plaids, seen on recent runways from labels like Rag & Bone and Thakoon, have a cool and cozy look that goes perfectly with breezy fall weather. Unfortunately, these Scottish-inspired fabrics are often made with wool, but before you fret, check out ModCloth’s cruelty-free and schoolgirl-sweet Pretty In Plaid dress. For a more subtle dose of lumberjack, tuck your skinny jeans into the Just Trekkin’ In Boot, which is made from 100-percent man-made materials, or slip on red tartan tights from Jonathan Aston. Shopping ethically doesn’t have to mean sacrificing style. Vegan fashion comes in all shapes, sizes, colors, and budgets, and this season’s best trends are all waiting to be brought home to your closet, guilt-free. "
VEGAN COOKIE SPREAD,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/vegan-cookie-spread,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2011","Think you’ve tried every nut-butter known to man (or woman)? Maybe you have. But before you gloat, have you tried a creamy vegan “butter” made of caramelized cookies crushed to smooth, spreadable perfection?  European company Lotus Bakeries is the mastermind behind this decadent paste, which is known as “speculoospasta” in its native Belgium. Sold under the decidedly more appetizing name of Biscoff in North America, the spread is made from slightly spiced cookies and can be used just about anywhere, including on sandwiches, fruit, toast, or oatmeal. You can even cause a jam in the cogs of the universe by spreading it on the very cookies from which it is made. Never before has a peanut-butter alternative been so meta, or so delicious.  "
NEW VEGAN RESTAURANT IN NC,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/new-vegan-restaurant-in-nc,"SEPTEMBER 11, 2011","Late last month, Asheville, NC welcomed Plant, a new all-vegan restaurant. Former video store owners Alan Berger and Leslie Armstrong teamed up with Jason Sellers, former head chef of veg eatery The Laughing Seed, to prepare vegan meals from locally grown, seasonal, and organic ingredients. The full-service restaurant cooks up tasty dishes like peppercorn-crusted seitan, raw enchiladas, smoked portabello steak, and sweet corn risotto. For Sunday brunch, diners can expect to sample classic tofu scramble, five-grain pancakes, and almond-glazed cinnamon rolls. In an interview with the Asheville Citizen-Times, Armstrong says, “I had always wanted to expose the world to good vegan food and let everyone know that just because it’s plant-based food doesn’t mean it isn’t fabulous.” "
MEMPHIS VEGAN DIET CHALLENGE,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/memphis-vegan-diet-challenge,"SEPTEMBER 11, 2011","Eat Healthy Memphis, a nonprofit health group promoting plant-based nutrition, has launched the Seven-Day Plant-Based Food Challenge, wherein participants are encouraged to commit to a vegan diet for a week. The organizers of the challenge suggest a regimen of primarily vegetables and smaller amounts of proteins, grains, and healthy fats for optimum health benefits. Bastet Ankh Re, the group’s founder and director, says that increasing the demand for nutritious plant-based foods can improve the health of Americans while also making food production more sustainable, environmentally friendly and efficient. The ongoing challenge asks participants to give up animal products for one week each month through June 2012, when the organization hopes to hold a plant-based food festival. "
VEGAN BEAUTY BOX GIVEAWAY,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/vegan-beauty-box-giveaway,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2011","Leaping Bunny, an organization dedicated to helping consumers find cruelty-free beauty products, and blog My Beauty Bunny recently launched a giveaway in which contestants have the opportunity to win $1,000 worth of vegan beauty products.

GEORGIA’S VEG COOKING CLASS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/georgias-veg-cooking-class,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2011","This month, vegan restaurant Gymnopedie will be offering Tuesday night veg cooking classes in Athens, Georgia. Students will learn to cook like a professional chef, as the classes are dedicated to sharpening skills in categories like knife work, bread baking, and even coffee tasting. Chef-owner Sarah Dunning hosts the two-hour classes, which cost $60 per person and include a light dinner. “One of the big ideas behind [the classes] is that you build a bit of community, you get to know people in the classes, and it is more about coming together,” Dunning said to Red and Black newspaper. “The food is the medium for meeting others we don’t cross paths with otherwise who live in the same town.”  "
VEG KIDS ORGANIZATIONS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/veg-kids-organizations,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2011","With back-to-school season revving up, education is on everyone’s mind. But there’s more to learning than just reading, writing, and arithmetic; real-world concepts like compassion, ethics, and health are just as essential. Opportunities are plentiful to team up with cruelty-free organizations, connect with veg kids, and interact with animals to get a full vegucation.  Meet Your Neighbors
Some of the best places for veggie kids to meet each other are located right in their very own neighborhoods and cities. Meetup.com allows you to find local veg event groups, such as NOVA Vegan Babies’ & Kids’ Group in Alexandria, Va.; the NYC Area Vegetarian & Vegan Parents & Kids group; and the Young Vegans of Pompano Beach, Fla. Because Meetup groups involve a variety of people from different walks of life, the possibilities for fun, creative events are endless. Veggie Kids Atlanta already boasts a strong following and hosts regular potluck picnics in the park, baby sign language classes, and festival fun in groups. If you can’t find the perfect veg group in your neighborhood, all the more reason to start your own! Giving Back
Veg teens have an opportunity to help care for abandoned and homeless pets while connecting with likeminded peers by volunteering at local animal shelters. With between 5 and 7 million animals sheltered each year, the demand for volunteers is limitless. Teens can connect with other volunteers of all ages to find loving homes for and enrich the lives of cats, dogs, rabbits, and other animals, through a commitment of just a few hours each week. The ASPCA runs (and depends on) its regular volunteer program, so inquire at local chapters for more information. Farm animal sanctuaries also rely on dedicated helpers, providing veg teens with unique opportunities to interact with the very animals they’re working to protect.  Digital Connection
While local groups can provide a face-to-face connection, our lives have become ever-entwined with the e-world, so building an online network is a viable option for creating community. PETA’s guide for kids, PETA2, is a web-based resource chock full of news, games, and facts that are compelling, yet kid-friendly. PETA2 also features an array of campaigns that kids can get involved in, such as anti-dissection crusades and a vegan pledge. To help kids make real-world impacts, PETA2 offers step-by-step guides to requesting veggie burgers in cafeterias and starting veg clubs in high schools. To be inspired by amazing vegan kids from around the world, check out blogs like Vegansaurus’ Happy Veggie Kids column. This feature showcases veggie kids and their reasons for ditching animal products, with a bonus of adorable crayon-drawn pink dinosaurs. To see what real-life for veg youngsters is like, check out Vegan Kid, a blog written by 12-year-old vegan Shae and his mom Kelly Dyer. Collaged with photos of Shae’s escapades in gardening, cooking up vegan pancakes, and even dying his hair green for St. Patrick’s Day, this blog demonstrates how fun and easy it can be to go veg, even before you can drive. Summer Camp
School may have just started, but kids are already daydreaming of next year’s summer vacation. Youngsters craving compassionate summer fun can dive into Camp Exploration, a combination of overnight and day camps that encourages campers to explore their surroundings while thinking critically about heavy topics like the environment, nutrition, and ethics. The camp is entirely cruelty-free, right down to the last bite of all-vegan fare. Forget zoos—Camp Exploration allows campers to develop a deeper understanding of interactions between humans and animals by taking field trips to animal sanctuaries. Mountain overnight retreats include star-gazing, hiking, glow-in-the-dark Frisbee, and roasting vegan marshmallows around the campfire. Youth Empowered Action Camp, another summer program, allows teens to choose a cause to work on, develop an action plan, and increase self-confidence in activism. YEA helps campers build a network of friends and mentors for support when they return home and begin working to make a difference in an important issue, such as animal rights. The camp meets for one-week sessions in California, Oregon, and New York each summer.  Whether in school or out, veggie kids have a multitude of resources at their fingertips for enjoying the best of the veg lifestyle. Here’s to the next generation of inspiring activists! "
NEW RAW VEGAN EATERY IN ONTARIO,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/new-raw-vegan-eatery-in-ontario,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2011","Last week, the Canadian city of Barrie welcomed the newest edition of Rawlicious, an Ontario restaurant chain focused on high-quality raw, organic, and gluten-free vegan cuisine. The new living foods café will be serving healthy fare similar to Rawlicious’ two existing locations, both in Toronto. Among the menu items are creative vegan interpretations of favorites like pad Thai, made with raw kelp and zucchini noodles, and a cashew-based cheesecake. Owner Jessica Valiant tells The Barrie Examiner, “The concept is healthy eating. It’s not tasteless, bland or dull.” "

More than 250 recently posted ads can be found on buses, trains, and transit stations, depicting striking images like a pig in a gestation crate, asking commuters, “How much cruelty can you swallow?” Another ad juxtaposes a pig and a puppy with the question, “Why love one but eat the other?” The ads encourage commuters to rethink their dietary choices, boycott animal abuse, and go veg. As the third largest city in America, Chicago boasts a population of nearly 2.7 million people, giving the MFA ample audience to spread its message.  "
VEGAN FAIR IN TEXAS THIS FALL,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/vegan-fair-in-texas-this-fall,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2011","Funnel cakes, corn dogs, and deep-fried s’mores may seem like the least veg-friendly foods imaginable, but this autumn, Texans will be treated to veganized versions at the Texas State Veggie Fair. The event will return on October 23 for its second year of vegan vendors, cooking contests, carnival games, a raffle, and more. Plant-based dietician Julieanna Hever and Vegucated’s Marisa Miller Wolfson are just two of the many speakers who will be giving presentations. One of the fair’s most popular attractions, a Vegan Fried Food Contest, will have contestants cooking up and competing with their finest cruelty-free gut-busters, like fried vegan mozzarella sticks and even a fried Reuben sandwich. The fair is hosted by dallasvegan.com, and will be preceded by a kick-off party courtesy of animal-welfare group Mercy For Animals. "
FDA UPDATING NUTRITION LABELS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/fda-updating-nutrition-labels,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2011","In the coming months, the Food and Drug Administration plans to revamp the nutrition facts labels found on packaged foods, a change the agency has been working toward since 2003. The proposed updates include more realistic serving sizes, an increased emphasis on calorie content and ingredients, and the possible omission of daily percent values and other components that the FDA has deemed unhelpful to consumers. FDA Deputy Commissioner Michael Taylor tells the Associated Press, “There’s no question obesity is a central public health concern that the nutrition-facts panel can play a role in. It’s obviously not a magic wand but it can be an informative tool.” "

CALIF. APPROVES SHARK BILL,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/calif-approves-shark-bill,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2011","The California Shark Protection Act gained final approval from the state’s legislature yesterday. The bill will ban the sale, trade, and possession of shark fins, the chief ingredient in shark fin soup, which can cost up to $100 per bowl. Acquiring the controversial ingredient entails slicing the fins off sharks and throwing the sea creatures back into the ocean alive and disabled, a practice which animal advocates have deemed cruel and unnecessary. If Gov. Jerry Brown signs the bill into law, the ban would take effect in 2013. “It’s time to stop serving a soup that is driving sharks to extinction,” says Paul Fong, an assembly member and one of the bill’s sponsors, to CNN. President Obama signed legislation in January, which tightened an 11-year-old ban on the practice in federal waters. California’s bill may actually have a greater impact than the federal legislature, as an estimated 85 percent of dried shark fin imports to the US come through the state.  "
WELFARE ORGANIZATION AWARDED,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/welfare-organization-awarded,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2011","The International Fund for Animal Welfare has recently hit the $1 million mark in total donations from greatergood.org.

PETITION TO BAN CRATES,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/petition-to-ban-crates,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2011","More than 4,300 people have signed a petition urging pork-products company Hormel to ditch the practice of confining pigs to gestation crates. Sows are kept in the crates, which prevent the pigs from walking or even turning around, before, during, and after repeated four-month pregnancy cycles. Several US states and the European Union have already passed legislation to outlaw the cruel practice, and many companies, including Burger King, Quiznos, and Chipotle, have been phasing out products from suppliers that use the crates. The petition to Hormel, the producer of Spam, Bacon Bits, and other meat-based products, began in early 2011 and is directed at the company’s President and CEO, Jeffrey Ettinger.  "
FOIE GRAS DOUGHNUT VEGANIZED,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/foie-gras-doughnut-veganized,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2011","Earlier this year, vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike were outraged by Brooklyn restaurant Do or Dine’s sale of foie-gras filled doughnuts, resulting in an oppositional petition that collected thousands of signatures. However, Dun Well Doughnuts and vegan caterer The Regal Vegan have joined forces to veganize the controversial pastry and its contentious filling. The Regal Vegan conceived its decadent “faux gras,” which is the filling for the doughnut, to prove that “delicious food doesn’t have to be bad for you, or anyone else for that matter.” Vegan blogger Joshua Katcher of The Discerning Brute had a chance to sample the cruelty-free treat and describes it as “tender, airy dough speckled with herbs, slightly sweet, fried to perfection, and injected with the Regal Vegan’s paté of caramelized onions, lentils, and walnuts.” "

ANTI-FACTORY FARM MUSIC VIDEO,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/anti-factory-farm-music-video,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2011","A new music video commissioned by Chipotle features Willie Nelson covering of Coldplay’s “The Scientist” combined with animation promoting an anti-factory farming stance. The video’s narrative follows farmers as they shift from traditional family farms to the industrial mode of factory farms, treating animals as products and pumping them full of antibiotics. Eventually, the farmer realizes the pollutive and exploitative consequences and reverts to a free-range, small-scale operation. Chipotle plans to show the video in 5,700 movie theaters across the country, and 60 percent of sales from the $.99 song on iTunes will be donated to the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation, which supports sustainable farming. Chipotle recently committed to using more than 10 million pounds of locally sourced produce this year. "

Ecological writer Michael Tobias asked PETA’s president her opinions on topics such as the biggest problems animal-rights groups face and the upcoming elections. Forbes magazine covers “information for the world’s business leaders,” which may allow PETA’s mission to reach a new audience. “At PETA, we often say that the issue of how animals are treated isn’t just about them; it’s about us, how we behave,” Newkirk says. “It is about what we are thinking when we do violent things to others whom we find it difficult to relate to or whom we dismiss as too unimportant to take into consideration at all.” "

DIY VEGAN DOG TREATS,https://vegnews.com/2011/9/diy-vegan-dog-treats,"SEPTEMBER 4, 2011","Truly man’s (or woman’s) best friend, dogs are our most trusted and worthy companions. Though they deserve the finest fare, our four-legged BFFs are often subjected to store-bought packaged foods that are chock-full of gag-inducing animal by-products, additives, preservatives, and chemical residue. Thankfully, dogs can also thrive on a regimen of vegan food. Commercial brands like Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula are available if you’re not a master chef, but in the eyes of our companion animals, nothing tastes better than when Mom (or Dad) makes it. While you may not have the time or money to whip up gourmet three-course meals for your pooch, one way that you can show him or her a little extra love is by preparing easy, homemade vegan dog treats. All you need is a little know-how about canine health and a few minutes of prep time. Because most pups have such voracious appetites and will eat anything—and everything—in front of them, many people don’t realize that doggy allergies go far beyond just chocolate. Beware of onions, garlic, macadamia nuts, grapes, raisins, peach pits, apple seeds, and hops, which are all detrimental to your dog’s health. Small amounts of onion and garlic are okay occasionally, but are toxic enough that continuous exposure can cause serious liver damage, anemia, and even death. Steer clear of these ingredients while whipping up snacks for your pooch, and don’t give in to begging without checking ingredients first to ensure your dog’s safety.  Now that we know what not to put in canine food, let’s focus on the positive. Most fruits, vegetables, and grains are safe for dogs, and healthy choices like carrots, bananas, peanut butter, carob, and oats can be made into tasty bites so good that you might find yourself sharing with Fido. Feel free to improvise by combining flour or oats, organic veg-based baby food, peanut butter, and shredded veggies to find your dog’s favorite flavors, or skip the brainstorming and check out one of the many vegan treat recipes already available. Peanut Butter Carrot Puppy Biscuits are a no-brainer, and the six simple ingredients needed might already be in your kitchen.  If your pup is always gazing up at you with Precious Moments eyes when you’re indulging in chocolate, relieve your guilt by baking up wheat-free Peanut Butter & Carob Doggie Treats that have the sweet cocoa flavor minus the poison factor.  If your dog is celebrating a birthday or has just been extra-good (saved you from a fire, folded your laundry, is heartbreakingly cute every single day), step it up by whipping up some Organic Banana Carob Dog-Friendly Vegan Cupcakes complete with cinnamon or carob frosting options. You’ll be guaranteed prances of jubilee and sloppy kisses in return.  Our creature companions deserve a taste of the kind diet, too. Going DIY on dog treats means knowing that you are saving animals beyond just your own while satisfying your pup’s appetite and your own peace of mind, so bake for your barker! Photo: Dogslivegreen "

In an interview last Friday with Alex Bogusky, founder of the blog FearLess Revolution, Gore cited industrial agriculture and a shift toward a more meat-intensive diet as large-scale contributors to global warming. Gore’s claims are supported by recent data from the Environmental Working Group; the organization’s chart detailing the greenhouse gas emissions of certain foods shows that the production of lamb creates nearly 20 times the emissions as those of broccoli and tofu. Gore also said that organic farming is much safer for the environment, as it puts more carbon back into the soil and produces “safer and better food.”    "

PLASTIC CHIPS FOUND IN BEEF,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/plastic-chips-found-in-beef,"AUGUST 22, 2011","The US Department of Agriculture has issued a new beef recall, this time due to an unusual contaminant: blue plastic chips. According to Food Safety News, a consumer found the chips in ground beef distributed by Vantage Foods, and subsequently, 1,642 pounds of product are currently being recalled from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Although of uncertain origin, the plastic chips are not believed to be a serious danger, warranting only a class III recall—the type connoting that there are no severe risks to human health. In addition to the 60,000 pounds of beef recalled last week due to E. coli contamination, 36 million pounds of ground turkey were recalled earlier this month due to an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant salmonella that has sickened more than 100 people and killed one.

CHIPOTLE BEANS CAUSE CONCERN,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/chipotle-beans-cause-concern,"AUGUST 21, 2011","Chipotle will be changing its menus to identify their pinto beans as non-vegetarian after Maxim senior editor Seth Porges, who does not eat pork, tweeted to the world about his disgust on discovering their covert ingredient: bacon. Although the porcine additive is nothing new, many customers of the chain were unaware of it since there is no mention of the beans containing bacon on the menu. However, Chipotle’s policy has always been to verbally recommend their black beans to diners requesting a vegetarian option. Chris Arnold, communications director for Chipotle, told the website Consumerist, “The menu panels have been redesigned to reflect [the] change, and the plan is to deliver them to restaurants along with other changes to the menu boards over the next several months.” "

GOVERNMENT AIDS POULTRY INDUSTRY,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/government-aids-poultry-industry,"AUGUST 17, 2011","A recent headline on meatingplace.com says it all: “USDA buys chicken products to help ailing industry.” As demand for chicken meat remains far below the number of birds who are actually being raised and killed, rather than allowing the market to adjust to basic supply and demand principles, the federal government Monday announced it will buy $40 million of unwanted chicken products that will be dumped on our nation’s school kids and others in federal food programs. In short, chicken-meat companies have continued increasing the number of birds they raise for food while demand has remained flat. Normally, in a free market, an industry that produces beyond what consumers want will contract. But not the poultry industry. It instead relies on regular government support in times like these—and by that I mean nearly all the time. According to The Wall Street Journal, the buyout, combined with a similar bonus government purchase last year, “gives producers an extra $86 million in government chicken purchases above the roughly $100 million the USDA buys in scheduled chicken purchases for a year.” And the support isn’t just in terms of buying unwanted product. The poultry industry receives billions in indirect agricultural subsidies that artificially reduce the cost of the most expensive part of their business: corn and soy grown to feed these billions of birds. The Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University estimates that the broiler chicken industry alone saved $1.25 billion in feed costs from 1997 to 2005 just from taxpayer-funded subsidies. Perhaps now that the Congress is more focused on slashing wasteful spending, these unnecessary and fiscally reckless industry handouts may finally be reduced. Why does this matter? Well, for many reasons, but most notably because these handouts mean that far more birds are raised on factory farms than American consumers would normally buy, especially if the true cost of their meat was reflected in the marketplace. And as Animal Visuals points out, poultry consumption results in far more animal deaths than most other animal products. Ending these handouts is the best option, and if the government is going to use our tax dollars for such purposes, at a bare minimum it should require animal-welfare improvements in the same way the auto industry had to improve fuel efficiency to get a federal bailout. And of course, when the auto industry got its federal dollars, it still had to return the money. Think the poultry industry will have to do that? I wouldn’t hold your breath. Not everyone is upset by this latest government bailout of the poultry industry, however. The National Chicken Council breathed a sigh of relief on behalf of its beleaguered industry, noting, “At a time when the industry is under great stress due to the high cost of feed ingredients and the general economic slowdown, we appreciate USDA’s willingness to step forward and acquire additional chicken.” In all the ways the American people expect the federal government to “step forward” these days, I’m not exactly sure this is what we had in mind.

SHOULD YOU JOIN A CSA?,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/should-you-join-a-csa,"AUGUST 16, 2011","One of the best ways to enjoy the bounty of the growing season is through community-supported agriculture shares (CSAs). Members of the program get a share of each week’s harvest, meaning that their pantries are always chock-full of farm-fresh veggies. But with so many share options, it can be tough to determine the best system for you and your family to participate in. This simple guide will ease your CSA share confusion for seasons to come. Know Your Grower
Aside from the obvious benefit of delivering fresh produce, CSA shares offer members an active way to discover where their food originates. Shareholders are often invited to farms, receive regular newsletters, and get to know the farmers growing the fruits and vegetables. The programs even benefit the environment, as they reduce the amount of fossil fuels used to transport and package the produce. Up-front shareholder payment allows farmers to upgrade their equipment and pay expenses without borrowing capital through high-interest loans, thus maintaining successful businesses and, in turn, supporting the local economy. While all programs differ, most farms price CSA shares based on the number of people in a household or the size of the share, allowing members to choose an amount that fits their needs. The initial cost can be prohibitively expensive for some, as it is often a few hundred dollars or more, but many farms allow people to work on the farm in exchange for a discount or pay in installments. Farmers will also prorate the cost for members who join mid-season. The cost of a CSA share is almost always less than you would pay for the same amount of fresh food at a grocery store each week. However, be sure to check the farms’ policies, as many refuse to give refunds for missed weeks, but will often allow shares to be gifted to a neighbor for a week or two if the shareholder is on vacation. How it Works
CSA share systems can vary as widely as the farms that offer them, although they typically work in three ways. The most common method is the pre-made box, usually for pick-up, although some farms deliver. Farmers evenly distribute the week’s harvest among shareholders and the boxes can include just about anything in season, from leafy kale and crisp cucumbers to juicy tomatoes and sweet peas. While shareholders may not receive their favorites each week, they are guaranteed variety, which creates an opportunity to try new veggies at their peak ripeness. The Washington State University Organic Farm uses this model of CSA, inviting shareholders to pick up a box once per week. Some farms also allow shareholders to choose their own share. Usually, these farms charge based on the number of people participating in the share, and pickup is often at a local farmers’ markets. Choose-your-own shares benefit those who want direct input into what they receive each week. To ensure everyone gets a share of the good stuff, farmers will put limitations on how many of a certain type of vegetable customers can take each week if that veggie is in short supply. For example, Early Morning Farm in Genoa, NY provides shareholders with a canvas bag, and allows them to come to the local farmers’ market and fill up with any produce they have available.  A point system also works for many farms and their customers. Basically, shareholders purchase a set number of points, either by the week or by the season as a whole. The point value of products can fluctuate from week to week depending on supply, but the overall system works to ensure that shareholders can pick what they’d like. Point-system CSA programs often offer add-ons, like coffee, fresh flowers, and fruit, for an additional fee, turning a share into a one-stop-shop for all things local, fresh, and delicious. Eating with the Seasons farm in San Juan Bautista, Calif., uses a credit-system to distribute weekly shares to members of its CSA program. Shareholders sign up for an allotted number of credits per week and request items they’re interested in. Farms provide shareholders with scores of fresh vegetables throughout the season. Shareholders also get the privilege of reconnecting with the origin of their food by getting to know their farmer each week. With all these benefits, it’s no wonder that shares sell-out all over the country each season. Those interested should talk to local farmers and find the right match while shares are still available.

The next time you have the urge to munch on some popcorn, relax in an air-conditioned cave, and dim the lights, check the marquee for one of these titles. Fat, Sick, & Nearly Dead
This inspiring documentary chronicles an Australian man’s personal journey in America from pill-addled obesity to juice-fueled wellness. The subject of the film, Joe Cross, finds himself in a bind when his weight reaches an all-time high, his health hits rock bottom, and traditional medicine seems to be providing little help. Cue a diet overhaul: Cross vows to consume only fresh fruit and vegetable juice for 60 days, and his total lifestyle transformation is underway. While on his quest for wellness, he also speaks to more than 500 Americans about their own health, and makes surprising connections with other people who are tired of relying on medication to treat their ailments. Rise of the Planet of the Apes
One of the biggest blockbusters in recent memory to tackle the issues surrounding animal testing, the newest interpretation of the Planet of the Apes series revisits the events that led to primate world takeover. The movie made headlines earlier this year when it was revealed that director Rupert Wyatt refused to use any animals in the production of the film—a move for which he was applauded by PETA—instead opting for eerily convincing CGI counterparts. Much of the plot is centered from a primate’s perspective, resulting in a compelling look at how animal testing makes monsters out of its propagators. Project Nim
It must be the Year of the Chimp: Project Nim, much like Rise of the Planet of the Apes, tackles the ethical issues surrounding the use of primates—highly intelligent, sentient, and often human-like beings—as the subjects of scientific experiments. From the directors of the acclaimed Man On Wire, this documentary follows Nim Chimpsky, a baby chimpanzee who is taken from his family and sent to live in a human household as part of a 1973 Columbia University psychology study intended to discover whether a chimp could acclimate and communicate with a human family. When he learns more than 120 words in sign language, hopes run high, but as the once-tiny primate grows up, Nim’s family must face the reality that chimps are meant to be chimps. Packed with interviews and footage, Project Nim deeply explores the complex relationship between humans and our animal counterparts. Vegucated
This hyped doc has been making the rounds at conferences for months, but has just recently raised enough funds for a broader release. Vegucated follows three meat-enthusiast New Yorkers who agree to go vegan for six weeks, initially lured by the premise of weight loss and improved health but gradually compelled by the ever-apparent, dark realities of the meat and dairy industries. The film will make its world premier at the Toronto Independant Film Festival in September. Combining comedy with compassion, the film has been likened to Super-Size Me and Food Inc.; you’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll never want to eat a cheeseburger again. Forks Over Knives
In a nation where one third of adults are considered obese, the Standard American Diet needs a major makeover, and T. Colin Campbell is coming to the rescue. The life and career of the Cornell nutritional biochemist, as well as that of surgeon and cancer expert Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, are the primary foci of this documentary, which delves into the hypothesis that the vast majority of diseases can be prevented or reversed by removing animal products from our diets. Additionally, filmmaker Lee Fulkerson agrees to adhere to a plant-based diet for a firsthand perspective on how our eating habits feed more than just our appetites. Along with Campbell’s best-selling books, this film and its diet plan have gained support from big names like Bill Clinton and Roger Ebert. "
NYC VEGAN BODEGA,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/nyc-vegan-bodega,"AUGUST 14, 2011","Ever wished that a bodega stocked with fresh produce, cruelty-free household products, and by-the-pound meat and cheese alternatives awaited you just down the block? If you live in New York City, that wish may soon become a reality. Aspiring vegan entrepreneur Eric Hopf and his family have started an Indiegogo campaign in hopes of opening the city’s first all-vegan convenience store. The Hopfs are currently seeking donations on the website in order to attain $15,000 that they can use to secure a space and purchase food storage equipment, products, and even a deli “non-meat” slicer for their proposed business, which would be the first bodega of its kind.

DEATHS PER CALORIE,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/deaths-per-calorie,"AUGUST 14, 2011","A study was recently published by Scientific American showing how many calories farm animals produce during their lifetimes. While chicken tops the list at providing 3,000 calories of meat for every slaughtered broiler chicken, eggs are a surprising runner-up, with 20,625 calories produced during the average lifespan of a laying hen. Beef and pork products account for more calories per each animal slaughtered, putting them in the middle. Milk and cheese were the least fatal products, producing around 17.6 million and 13.3 million calories given per lifespan of a dairy cow, respectively. The chart shows that while many people forgo meat consumption in attempt to reduce the deaths of animals, eggs and dairy consumption still has a profound impact, due to the fact that cows and chickens are often slaughtered at an early age, once they stop producing at a profitable level for factory farms.

INDIA IMPLEMENTS VEG LABELS,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/india-implements-veg-labels,"AUGUST 14, 2011","This month, India has mandated that all food manufacturers must provide clear indicators on packaged foods denoting whether or not the product contains any animal-derived ingredients. The Food Safety and Standards Regulations issued on August 5 require that all items containing non-vegetarian components be marked with a red circle within a square; conversely, products suitable for vegetarians and vegans will be labeled with a green version of the same mark. Unfortunately, the US has yet to put a similar system in place, as the US Department of Agriculture recommends—but does not require—that manufacturers label the presence of animal-derived ingredients in their foods.

ORGANIC AGRICULTURE SAFER,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/organic-agriculture-safer,"AUGUST 13, 2011","A new study in Environmental Health Perspectives has confirmed what experts have long suspected; that the widespread use of antibiotics on cow and chicken farms has increased the risk of bacteria mutating and developing resistance to drugs. Researchers tested 20 chicken farms, half organic and half conventional, for microbes, and found that the organic farms had a much lower incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which increase the dangers of food poisoning. A separate study in Foodborne Pathogens and Diseases also found that packaged organic chicken meat in stores has only one-seventh the incidence of salmonella as conventional chicken. Although much of the US meat industry continues to deny this correlation, most European nations have already banned the use of antibiotics for non-therapeutic purposes in livestock. "

VEG PROTEINS FIGHT DIABETES,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/veg-proteins-fight-diabetes,"AUGUST 11, 2011","Harvard researchers have found that replacing the consumption of meat with nuts and whole grains can significantly lower one’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes. An analysis of nearly 300,000 health professionals age 25 to 75 revealed that while a daily 50-gram serving of processed meat increased the risk of developing the disease by 51 percent, replacing that serving with the same-size portion of nuts or whole grains actually decreased the likelihood by more than 20 percent. Frank Hu, MD, PhD, one of the authors of the study, comments to The New York Times, “We’re talking about switching from a meat-centered diet to a more plant-based diet for the prevention of diabetes and other chronic diseases.” "
VEGETARIAN CO-OP OPENS,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/vegetarian-co-op-opens,"AUGUST 11, 2011","An Oregon couple is organizing a vegetarian dinner co-op in Eagle Creek. Sarah Brinkley got the idea when she found herself hungry at home, with no money to buy dinner, and no desire to cook. After an unsuccessful search for a local co-op, she decided to team up with her boyfriend, O’Neil McCord, to start their own. The couple is inviting other local residents to share in a common meal plan, which would have each participant cooking a meal for 10 people on one day and enjoying meals cooked by other members during the rest of the week. “In theory, it would cut down on food costs,” Brinkley tells the Sandy Post. “You’re cooking one meal for a group, which means buying more of the same ingredients versus a whole different variety of items, which can rack up a food bill.” "
VEGAN DINING HALL IN TEXAS,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/vegan-dining-hall-in-texas,"AUGUST 10, 2011","While many college dining halls have vegan students heading to the salad bar day after day, the University of North Texas (UNT) is raising standards with its new all-vegan cafeteria. Set to open this fall, Maple Hall cafeteria will serve foods that students already enjoy, such as pizzas and paninis, minus meat, dairy, and other animal by-products. Dining services also revamped the dining hall’s décor, inspired by Texas veg restaurants like Spiral Diner and Cosmic Café. Ken Botts, special program director for the university’s dining services, hopes this change will keep UNT students healthier and encourage more vegetarians to consider attending the university. “We put a lot of effort into designing recipes that would provide protein, the necessary vitamins, and nutrition to a balanced diet,” Botts says, “You’ll get a better balanced opportunity in your food choices at Maple than you would at any other eating establishment in and around campus.” "
POLL: FARM ANIMAL WELFARE,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/poll-farm-animal-welfare,"AUGUST 10, 2011","A poll conducted earlier this year by the Center for Applied Rural Innovation found some interesting perceptions—and contradictions—about animal welfare. Roughly 2,500 rural Nebraskans shared their beliefs about the treatment of farm animals, and while 95 percent agreed that animal welfare means providing adequate food, water, and shelter, 69 percent said that it should also include adequate exercise, space, and social activities. However, 84 percent also believed that livestock farmers and their veterinarians were the best authorities on how to care for their animals, and 56 percent agree that current regulations are sufficient to ensure the welfare of livestock. Between 30 and 40 percent of participants had personal experience with raising chickens or cattle in the past or present, which likely impacted many of their attitudes. "

ANIMAL FIGHT ATTENDANCE BAN,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/animal-fight-attendance-ban,"AUGUST 9, 2011","Late last week, a new bill was signed into New York state law, which takes the ban on animal fighting a step further—attending a dog fight or cockfight will now result in a misdemeanor offense. The ASPCA had lobbied New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to increase the severity of the punishments associated with the cruel sport. While animal fighting is a felony throughout the US, attendees would only be punished with a violation and a small fine in NY, prior to the new law. “Animal fighting is an extremely cruel, but lucrative, underground business,” says Debora Bresch, senior director of ASPCA Government Relations. “This new law will allow law enforcement to pursue and punish the spectators who drive the market for animal fighting, keeping it alive.” "

SALMONELLA-TAINTED TURKEY,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/salmonella-tainted-turkey,"AUGUST 8, 2011","The US Department of Agriculture has traced a recent salmonella outbreak, which has killed one person and sickened nearly 80 others, back to ground turkey distributed by Cargill, one of the nation’s largest meat producers. Roughly 36 million pounds of ground turkey were recalled by the company on August 3, resulting in the third largest meat recall in history. Tests have indicated that this strain of the bacteria may also be resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics, and the hospitalization rate for those infected is 38 percent, which is higher than normal. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 50 million people are afflicted with food poisoning every year, and about 3,000 die from it. "
CANADA’S WELFARE LABELS,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/canadas-welfare-labels,"AUGUST 8, 2011","Canadians who shop at Whole Foods Market will now be able to use an integrated animal-welfare rating system to determine the quality of facilities and practices of the farms that they are buying products from. The “Five-Step Animal Welfare Rating” classifies each meat product on a scale from one (orange) to five (green), with specific criteria laid out for each step of the animals’ upbringing and treatment. Currently, the labels only address broiler chickens, pigs, and beef cattle, but the chain also uses a “sustainability rating” for fish. The labels are already in use at many Whole Foods stores in the United States. "

VANILLA COCONUT MILK,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/vanilla-coconut-milk,"AUGUST 8, 2011","Is coconut the new hemp or almond, shape-shifting into every delicious incarnation possible? No longer synonymous with the super-heavy stuff in dented cans, coconut milk seems to be popping up in more versatile, tasty forms every day. Bargain grocer extraordinaire Trader Joe’s has just come out with a fridge-friendly carton version in unsweetened or vanilla flavors, both of which have been big hits at the VNHQ. It’s thicker and more filling than other non-dairy milks, but actually has fewer calories per cup than most soymilks in spite of coconut’s fattening reputation. Even better, you get the taste of tropical paradise with every sip. We like that. "
MAN DENIED VEG MEALS IN JAIL,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/man-denied-veg-meals-in-jail,"AUGUST 7, 2011","A Mill Valley, Calif., man has gotten attention from activists this week—not for his recent release from jail after charges against him were dropped, but for the weight that he dropped while incarcerated due to being denied access to vegetarian food. Seventy-year-old Dave McDonald, a 42-year vegetarian, lost nearly 50 pounds in 99 days while he served time in a Marin County facility that refused to accommodate his meat-free diet. California correctional institutes are legally required to serve vegetarian food to inmates if they cite religious or medical reasons, but not for other belief systems. “I don’t want animal corpses on my plate,” McDonald said after his release. “My belief in not hurting animals is more powerful than any religious belief.” "

Menu items include chipotle mac-n-cheese, barbecue shredded jackfruit pulled pork, and unchicken and waffles. On the restaurant’s concept, co-owner Madeleine Foote says, “The idea is that vegans like to eat junk food and comfort food just like everybody else … When you open a vegan restaurant you’re not doing it for money. You’re doing it because you have a philosophy and you think that the food should be out there.” "

FDA REDEFINES GLUTEN-FREE TERM,https://vegnews.com/2011/8/fda-redefines-gluten-free-term,"AUGUST 4, 2011","The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced Tuesday that it will be re-examining the standards by which foods on supermarket shelves can be labeled as “gluten-free”. Currently, the amount of gluten permitted in “gluten-free” items available in stores can vary. The FDA says that it is aiming to “eliminate uncertainty about how food producers may label their products,” as well as “assure consumers who must avoid gluten that foods labeled ‘gluten-free’ meet a clear standard established and enforced by the FDA.” Gluten inflames the small intestine of people who suffer from celiac disease; the protein, commonly found in wheat, barley, and rye, is often used as a stabilizing agent in as assortment of foods such as condiments, ice cream, and soy sauce.

While these statistics show how television may influence kids’ abilities to make healthy eating choices, the good news is that children were exposed to fewer food commercials overall in 2009 than in 2003, due in part to the implementation of the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Campaign.

The tests involved scientists placing treats in colored, multi-shaped buckets in order to see if the sheep could retrieve the treat. The sheep could remember how to solve the problems up to 90 percent of the time during the six-week testing period and adapted to variations of the tests. The report concluded with a discussion of how this research can be used, stating, “Our study opens new possibilities for the study of complex emotional as well as cognitive behaviours, not only in the context of neurological disorders, but also in normal animals.” "

REPORT: POULTRY POLLUTION,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/report-poultry-pollution,"JULY 31, 2011","A new report by the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Environment Group has found that the industrial factory farming of chickens produces millions of cubic feet of waste each year. Concentrated-feeding operations in Delaware and Maryland on the Delmarva Peninsula alone generated enough chicken waste to fill the US Capitol dome about 50 times, with much of the nitrogen and phosphorous by-products polluting the Chesapeake Bay. Almost nine billion broiler chickens were produced in 2007, up from 3.5 billion 25 years prior. Pew suggests that the growing industry should adopt reforms, such as limiting the density of animal production and proposing shared financial and legal responsibility between poultry growers and corporate integrators for managing waste, in order to limit environmental impact.

MFA’s campaign features women holding blood-spattered milk cartons and responding with slogans such as, “PMS! No, I’m livid with the milk industry for abusing and killing cows.” The California Milk Processor Board issued an apology two weeks after its ads appeared due to strong criticism that the ads were sexist.

NEW VEGGIE SURVEY,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/new-veggie-survey,"JULY 29, 2011","The Vegetarian Society, an educational British charity focused on representing vegetarians, has launched the Big Veggie Survey, which aims to shed some light on why some people don’t eat meat and the difficulties they face in society. The questionnaire asks participants about their eating habits, convictions, and desires for progress, and is available online until September 3. All vegans, vegetarians, ex-veggies, and meat-reducers over the age of 16 are welcome to participate. Dr. Jon Green, the organization’s chief executive, explains, “With vegetarians, vegans, and others who have an interest in vegetarianism coming from all sorts of different perspectives, it’s vitally important for us to check in every so often to find out what people really think.” "
NEW SCHOOL LUNCHES,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/new-school-lunches,"JULY 28, 2011","This upcoming school year, health-minded students in Greenville County School District in South Carolina will be able to opt for vegetarian, raw, and unprocessed foods during their lunches. Partnering with the Culinary Institute at Greenville Technical College, cafeteria workers are being trained to prepare more nutritious meals, such whole-grain pastas, black bean burgers, and tofu. The district’s nutritionist estimates that 41 percent of the students suffer from obesity, and some have additional health problems like high cholesterol and diabetes. This new lunch program could help lower the alarming health statistics. “We have always said a hungry child can’t learn,” Kim Kelley, a cafeteria worker, told a local news station. “If we are giving them something that will keep them full longer and help their brain power, how do you argue with that?” "
CONSUMERS WANT LABELS,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/consumers-want-labels,"JULY 28, 2011","Most consumers support the idea of mandatory animal welfare labels on meat and dairy products, according to a new poll conducted by Kansas State University and Michigan State University. The study included more than 2,000 Americans, and found that more than 61 percent of participants wanted farmers that use gestation crates for pigs or battery cages for chickens to be required to label their products. Additionally, the data indicated that consumers could be willing to pay up to 20 percent more for meat or dairy that was labeled to convey that it was not made using these practices. In several states, gestation crates and battery cages have already been outlawed due to their extreme confinement. "

An affiliate of PCRM called The Cancer Project aims to educate the public about research that found a 21 percent increase in the risk of colorectal cancer for every 50 grams of processed meat consumed daily. This week, the group revealed a billboard near the Indianapolis Motor Speedway that depicts hot dogs in a pack with a warning label similar to cigarettes. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 140,000 cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year, making it the second leading cause of cancer-related death. "

Jerry Brown signed a bill into law yesterday that will render it illegal to sell animals on any street, highway, parking lot, carnival, or boardwalk. According to the Humane Society of the United States’ statement about the measure, “Animals sold in unregulated, outdoor venues are often in terrible conditions. The animals are being sold often live in unsanitary crowded pens or cages, without food and/or water, in extreme heat.” Additionally, the bill will increase fines and jail sentences for those convicted of misdemeanor animal neglect to be consistent with those of felony animal cruelty. Brown also instituted a bill to take greater measures against cockfighting by allowing landlords to evict tenants who are using their property for animal fighting. "

While 13-year-vegan Silverstone has only fed Bear vegan foods since his birth in May, she made the official statement to a recent British edition of OK! magazine. “I intend to take great care of his precious new baby body so I’m committed to giving him nothing but the purest and most healthy food possible,” she said. “We want to keep his immune system strong so that he’ll be super healthy—which is just one of the many reasons he’ll eat vegan.”  "
UK NEWSPAPERS DOWN ON VEGANS,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/uk-newspapers-down-on-vegans,"JULY 26, 2011","A recent study in The British Journal of Sociology determined that national newspapers in the UK published a greater number of negative than positive articles about vegans in 2007. Researchers Matthew Cole and Karen Morgan discovered that almost 75 percent of articles about veganism featured negative portrayals, such as anti-vegan stereotypes, ridicule of plant-based diets, and characterization of vegans as hostile. The study used 397 articles from 19 newspapers, classifying less than six percent as positive and about 20 percent as neutral. “Vegaphobic discourse facilitates the continued normalization of human violence on an unimaginable scale,” concluded the study. “Instead of veganism being used as an opportunity to open up debates about our relationships with nonhuman animals, it is abused as a reason not to care, or even think, about these issues.” "

The eatery, called Fuel, will serve a variety of cuisines including Cajun, Cuban, and Mexican, as well as daily offerings of assorted greens and Southern boiled nuts. Owner and chef Denise Miller described the menu to the Kalamazoo Gazette as having “complexity, depth, sophistication” and confirms that it will be “plant-based and grain-based.” On being the only restaurant of its kind in town, she commented, “What was most important to us was that vegetarians have a home. It is unbelievable that we live in a college town where there’s been no vegetarian restaurant.” "
NATIVE FOODS OPENS IN CHICAGO,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/native-foods-opens-in-chicago,"JULY 25, 2011","Native Foods Café is bringing vegan food to a new location in Chicago beginning next week. The restaurant will be in Wicker Park/Bucktown—what CEO Daniel Dolan considers one of Chicago’s “vegan hotspots.” Featured on the 100-percent cruelty-free menu are such dishes as portobello sausage burgers, chili-cheese fries, sesame kale macro bowls, and Greek gyros. Executive chef Tanya Petrovna founded Native Foods 17 years ago in Palm Springs and has since expanded the eatery to seven locations in California.

VEG DIETS HIGH IN NUTRIENTS,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/veg-diets-high-in-nutrients,"JULY 25, 2011","A study published this month in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association challenges the notion that meat-free diets are lacking certain nutritional requirements. Research conducted at Eastern Michigan University found that vegetarian diets actually surpass non-vegetarian diets in levels of iron, calcium, fiber, riboflavin, and magnesium intake, as well as boast high, healthy levels of protein, vitamin B12, and zinc. This data may help dispel the familiar misconception that vegetarians are in danger of not getting enough protein or iron from a plant-based diet. "
CONSUMERS PREFER ORGANIC,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/consumers-prefer-organic,"JULY 25, 2011","A new poll conducted by Thomson Reuters revealed that consumers are more eager than ever to find organic, locally grown produce, but also have some qualms with its price. Results showed that 58 percent of participants preferred organic food over conventional products, with the largest demographics with this preference being young people and those who have had higher education. Income, however, was not a significant factor. The most popular reasons for choosing organic were supporting local farms, avoiding toxins, environmental health, and taste, in that order. Conversely, 54 percent of poll-takers also believe that organic food is too expensive. "
HOW TO COOK VEGAN FOR YOUR FAMILY,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/how-to-cook-vegan-for-your-family,"JULY 25, 2011","Vegan chef Ann Gentry is a culinary powerhouse. The founder of Real Food Daily, the wildly popular Los Angeles vegan eatery that is soon to expand into Los Angeles International Airport, and author of The Real Food Daily Cookbook, has recently penned Vegan Family Meals, a beautiful cookbook filled with imaginative recipes perfect for the weeknight dinner table and dinner parties. VegNews sat down with the culinary mogul to find out more about Vegan Family Meals, vegan parenting, and what’s on her dinner table. VegNews: What inspired you to write Vegan Family Meals?
Ann Gentry: Over the last few years, I found myself cooking at home more and enjoying re-visiting recipes I hadn’t made in years as well as whipping up new ones. I also thought I had something to say as a busy working mother because I struggle with the same day-to-day challenges everyone else has. Food wise, I’ve learned to stick with a plant-based diet, especially when cooking at home. Whole grains and vegetables are relatively simple to prepare, always accessible, and very economical. VN: What is your go-to weeknight meal that you make for your family?
AG: A quick and simple bean-, grain- or vegetable-based soup; quinoa, rice, or soba noodles with a peanut or tahini sauce; and seasonal roasted vegetables or sautéed vegetables. VN: Is everyone in your family vegan? If not, how do you navigate the varying diets?
AG: We eat primarily vegan at home. When the kids go to birthday parties or other social occasions, they eat vegetarian.  We allow them to eat these “non-vegan” foods from time to time, not to supplement their vegan diet (as there are no supplements to an already ideal diet), but rather to allow them joy, comfort, and participation in their childhood social settings. VN: What advice can you give to new vegan parents?
AG: If you haven’t had children yet, start at birth! The palates of infants and toddlers are relatively bland.  The tiniest bit of flavor is intense for them and they prefer the simplicity of one taste or texture at a time. When they get a little older, start educating kids about where food comes from and how it is grown. Have them around in the kitchen when you are preparing their food and get them involved. I think most kids recognize quality fresh foods. Adults corrupt kids’ palates by feeding them fat, salt, and too many sweets. Unfortunately, kids get addicted to the highly processed foods and it becomes hard to move away from them. But you can, and I did! Before you change your children’s diet, you have to change yours. You set the example. Your kids will follow your lead. VN: How do you balance running a successful vegan restaurant with being a mom?
AG: Lots of strong brewed black tea in the morning, an afternoon nap, and a wing and a prayer at night. VN: For those who want to cook more at home but don’t know where to start, what’s three pieces of advice you can give them? 1. Be patient and kind to yourself. It takes time to really change your diet, because to change your diet, you ultimately have to change your mindset and lifestyle. 2. A plant-based diet encourages creativity in the kitchen. Prepare the best local and seasonal ingredients with a variety of cooking methods, and you’ll come up with more interesting and diverse flavors, textures, and colors on your plate.   3. Think about balancing your nutrition intake across the week, and don’t get hung up on making every meal a feast. Instead, focus on preparing a few recipes that will keep your cooking simple and your time in the kitchen enjoyable.

Do Or Dine, a restaurant in Brooklyn, offers the $11 doughnut that many have denounced because of the cruel practices used to produce its fatty filling. Vegan blogger Annie Hartnett has penned a petition against the pastries, which so far has gathered more than 1,200 signatures. Foie gras, or “fat liver” translated, is made by force-feeding ducks or geese until their livers swell to 10 times their normal size. Many European nations have already outlawed the procedure, including Denmark, Italy, Finland, Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. "

During the study, mothers were encouraged to first breastfeed their babies, but those who later chose to feed their babies formula were given a special concoction that did not contain the complex proteins. While scientists are still awaiting the full study results, the pilot study, which enrolled more than 2,000 subjects with a family history of type 1 diabetes, proved that those who avoided cow’s milk were 60 percent less likely to develop the disease. This new research could help prevent diabetes, which affects one of every 400 American children. "

MEAT’S CLIMATE IMPACT,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/meats-climate-impact,"JULY 19, 2011","A chart released this week by the Environmental Working Group called “The Meat Eater’s Guide” details the environmental impact of 20 different foods, and the results were not flattering for meat and cheese. The study traced the greenhouse gas emissions of each item from farm to shelves and found that the carbon footprint of lamb is nearly 20 times larger than those of beans and tofu. The worst offenders behind lamb were beef and cheese, while the least environmentally detrimental items were tomatoes and lentils. Although similar studies have been done before, this one stands apart for considering every aspect of production including pesticide and fertilizer consumption, processing, transportation, and cooking.

CALIFORNIA DAIRIES CLOSE,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/california-dairies-close,"JULY 19, 2011","California was home to 1,800 independent dairies in 2008, but more than 250 have since closed due to increased costs of production. One of the biggest expenses at dairy farms is cattle feed, which has doubled in price since 2004, yet the retail price of milk only rose about five percent. Despite these closures, the USDA’s Economic Research Service says that consumers can still expect to see an increase in American dairy products due to increased demand in foreign markets. While dairy popularity increases abroad, Americans seem to be making more compassionate choices. The US market for milk substitutes, such as almond milk, grew 13 percent in 2010, putting California at an economic advantage as the producer of 75 percent of the world’s almond supply.   "
HUMAN-DERIVED GELATIN CREATED,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/human-derived-gelatin-created,"JULY 18, 2011","While conventional gelatin is made from the collagen found in the bones, skin, and cartilage of pigs and cows, Chinese researchers have discovered a new way to make gelatin by using human DNA. Scientists from the Beijing University of Chemical Technology have developed human-derived gelatin by injecting bits of human gelatin genes into strains of yeast. Researcher Jinchun Chen and his team reported in The Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry that the new gelatin allows for higher quality control than animal-based gelatin. Gelatin can be found in a number of everyday products, such as marshmallows, gummies, and cosmetics, but the scientists hope to use the human-derived gelatin for medical purposes, such as manufacturing of drug capsules.

FISH POPULATIONS THREATENED,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/fish-populations-threatened,"JULY 18, 2011","Experts have warned of the dangers of overfishing and oceanic pollution for decades, and new reports confirm that many species are currently facing endangerment or extinction. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported 48 populations considered overfished in its 2010 “Status of Stocks” report, and the World Wildlife Fund also recently noted that 75 percent of European fisheries are overfished, with only nine percent of European fish stocks considered sustainable by 2022. Among the most threatened are tuna, with five out of eight species “at risk of extinction,” as well as shellfish, whose populations are predicted to decline considerably in the next 10 to 50 years. In addition to overfishing, warming water and oceanic acidification continue to be major contributors to their endangerment. "
HOW TO MAKE A VEGAN ZINE,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/how-to-make-a-vegan-zine,"JULY 18, 2011","With a recent wave of quality vegan zines enjoying the advent of DIY everything, it’s the best time ever to craft your own vegan zine. Zines are a great vehicle for both creative types and broke aspiring authors to get their work out without having to relentlessly send submissions to publications and subject themselves to the whims of editors. Whether it’s a comic compilation, a cook-zine, or a collection of essays, making your own vegan zine is as easy as ever with help from tips from VegNews and a few select vegan zine-makers. All You Need Is An Idea
In true DIY spirit, the prospect of making a zine is as approachable as ever, and all you really need to get started is an idea. “I’ve wanted to be a comic nerd as long as I can remember and have drawn comics since I was a little kid ripping story lines off of Gary Larson. However, the breadth and passion of the comics scene really intimidated me well into my adult years,” says Erika Larson, creator of the vegan Soyf***er zine, which donates proceeds to deserving organizations like the Berkeley East Bay Humane Society. “Additionally, since going vegan I feel like there is a severe under-representation of vegan perspectives in the comic arts, and those that exist don’t really reflect my experiences as a vegan.” VegNews Editor-At-Large Laura Hooper Beck decided she needed to make a zine after being inspired by others and recognizing a niche waiting to be filled. Beck recently launched Fat Zine!, which she says cost her about $76 from start to finish, and is paying that amount back with the proceeds of her zine sold online and at the recent San Francisco Zine Fest. “There just isn’t that much stuff out there that’s body positive for women. I wanted to make something that said, ‘hey, it’s okay if you’re not skinny, or it’s okay if you are—whatever!’ and I did it with a fat-positive bend because hardly anything is,” said Beck. “I want to open up that dialogue more. Plus, I love working with glitter, and my zine has a lot of it.” DIY Doesn’t Mean Doing It Alone
One of the most rewarding parts of putting together a zine is sifting through the spirited work of eager contributors. You might be surprised at how many people long to see their artwork and/or writing in print, and share your own passions for vegan zinemaking. Make use of online social media to get the call out for submissions. Larson got the word out through vegan forums and blogs like the Post Punk Kitchen forums and Vegansaurus, while Beck utilized Craigslist, postering in local comic and zine shops, Twitter, and Facebook. When it comes to putting out a call it helps to know those involved, (Beck’s partner is the talented zine-maker Jonas Madden-Conner), but if you don’t know anyone, don’t worry! Zinesters share a common passion, and social media outlets like Facebook make it easier than ever to connect with those you admire. “I’ve had some incredible support from people who really and truly give veganism a good name, like [cookbook author] Isa Chandra Moskowitz, and Josh Hooten and Michelle Schwegmann [of Herbivore Clothing Company],” says Larson. Zines to Know
To get you inspired and moving on your own vegan zine, (Beck urges in an article in the The Bold Italic to “just do it”), look to the following existing vegan zines and self-published cookbooks. In addition to the aforementioned publications, check out Nicole J. Georges’ autobiographical Invincible Summer, Susie Cagle’s tales of volunteering with the San Francisco chapter of Food Not Bombs in Nine Gallons, and the cookzine Papa Tofu. Zine publishers Microcosm, who published the great vegan cookbooks Please Don’t Feed the Bears, Hot Damn and Hell Yeah, and In Search of the Lost Taste, offer an excellent how-to for zinemakers called Make A Zine. There are scads of other excellent zines, from light comics to dead-serious non-fiction zines about animal testing, so while you add to the dialogue, do look into zinemakers and retailers in your community. You’ll be amazed by the passion of the self-publishing vegan community. “I think vegan culture is exploding right now; it certainly seems more diverse, exciting, and limitless than it did ten years ago, and a vegan comic zine seemed like a great way for me to celebrate and take part in that expansion,” says Larson. Larson also offers a final word of encouragement: “The same advice I follow for tattoos: Go large! Life is too damn short for hesitation, procrastination, or deliberation. Life rewards those who put themselves out there, and doing what you want to do regardless of limitations or criticism is its own reward.” "
CBS: NY’S BEST VEGAN ICE CREAMS,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/cbs-nys-best-vegan-ice-creams,"JULY 17, 2011","Media giant CBS has some sweet tips under its sleeves for vegans in the Big Apple; its local outlet in New York has listed the Top 5 Shops For Dairy-Free Ice Cream in the city. Who got the top honors? Scoop slingers like Stogo, who use hemp and coconut bases in addition to soy and have flavors like Salted Caramel Pecan and Bananas Foster; Lula’s Sweet Apothecary, which resembles an old-fashioned parlor and even has soft-serve (!), and Counter, a fully vegetarian bistro with nut-based desserts. Ice Cream House and Maze’s Creamery also made the cut. Hopefully, CBS’s vegan-friendly foray will inspire some lactovores to taste what they’re missing.  "
VEGAN CHEESEBURGER EXPERIMENT,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/vegan-cheeseburger-experiment,"JULY 17, 2011","A new experiment by Stanford University biochemistry professor Pat Brown might convince vegans across the US to reconsider McDonald’s. For the past 18 months, Brown has been trying to formulate a vegan version of the McDonald’s cheeseburger. “Thirty percent of the entire land surface is devoted to animal farming… do we want to use 30 percent of land for something that is not essential?” Brown told paloaltopatch.com. Don’t rush to the golden arches and expect to see this new item anytime soon, though; while the scientist has made significant progress in development of two types of dairy-free cheese, meat production will take at least another year. Although not officially hired by McDonald’s, Brown hopes to sell the vegan alternative to the company in 2012. "
"EAT PLANTS, WEIGH LESS",https://vegnews.com/2011/7/eat-plants-weigh-less,"JULY 17, 2011","Plant-based diets may reduce the likelihood of obesity in children, according to a new study by The Nutrition Journal. The report found that of the 1,764 children studied, those who consumed greater amounts of whole grains, nuts, and vegetables weighed less than those who avoided them. The Center for Disease Control states that 12.5 million children suffer from obesity, a condition which increases the risk of dangerous health problems such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. With the recent Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act reforming school lunches across America, perhaps this new information will help to decrease the rates of childhood obesity. "
COKE BOTTLES GO PLANT-BASED,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/coke-bottles-go-plant-based,"JULY 16, 2011","If you happen to buy a Coke in Johannesburg in the near future, take a closer look at the bottle. In 2007, Coca-Cola pledged to increase its environmental efforts by focusing on “water stewardship, sustainable packaging, energy management, and climate protection,” and South Africa is seeing results. The company recently announced that it will be switching to plant-based bottles derived from sugarcane for its products in the African nation as well as “going green” with its new plant in Heidelberg. South Africa is the 10th global market for PlantBottle, which is considered a more sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based plastics. It is predicted that global demand for biodegradable or plant-based plastic will quadruple by 2013. "

Dairy free-ice creams may seem like nothing new, but what sets this guilt-free treat apart is that it is derived from the seeds of blue sweet lupin, a plant indigenous to Germany sometimes known as the “soybean of the North” that contains valuable proteins and regulates cholesterol. The product recently hit European shelves under the brand Lupinesse, and flavors include Vanilla-Cherry, Strawberry-Mousse, Walnut Dream, and Choco-Flakes. Now all we need is a taste test. "

HIGH TEMPS KILL FARM ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/high-temps-kill-farm-animals,"JULY 14, 2011","Scorching summer temperatures have killed tens of thousands of chickens and turkeys this week. According to the Associated Press, 50,000 chickens died at a farm in North Carolina after the power went out for less than an hour. A Kansas Butterball farmer lost 4,400 turkeys last weekend after temperatures escalated to 110 degrees. While most poultry farms equip their chicken houses with cooling systems, power failures can cause extreme heat in the crowded coops. The dangers of factory farming increase in the summer, as birds tend to swarm near any source of ventilation, so even if they survive the heat, they may smother each other. The National Weather Service has announced an excessive heat watch for much of Kansas through the weekend. "

Surveying people from 14 states at vegan and vegetarian festivals, he asked them to rank the importance of factors which may have contributed to their veg diet. Reasons included opposition to killing animals, health concerns, peer pressure, and food safety issues. Lukefahr, a professor in the department of animal and wildlife sciences, presented his findings at the Joint Annual Meeting of the American Dairy Science Association and the American Society of Animal Science earlier this week in New Orleans.

Notices for the proposed farm were posted in Adams County; citizens of Coloma, a mere three miles away, were not informed of the plans because Coloma resides in the adjacent county of Waushara. Residents and business owners have started a grassroots campaign against the concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO). Bruce Van Schaak, a resident, tells wisbusiness.com, “I own a beautiful home in Coloma and I also have land less than 1,000 feet of the proposed ‘dairy farm’ where I intend to build my retirement home in five years.” He continues, “Why would I continue to have this dream if the water tables and air quality will degrade with this CAFO?” "
UK FISH DISAPPEAR,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/uk-fish-disappear,"JULY 12, 2011","Despite the fact that the UK is surrounded on all sides by ocean, the nation imports half of the fish it consumes. Demand for fish vastly outpaces the oceans’ ability to restock around Britain, where the fisheries are empty just halfway through the year. Around Europe, there are a number of Fish Dependence Days, which signify the day of the year on which a given country’s supply of fish would have been exhausted had fish not been imported from other nations. And the effects of overfishing can be devastating throughout the oceanic ecosystem. While the European Union is at work on revising the Common Fisheries Policy, one easy solution to the problem would be to decrease fish consumption across Europe.  "

CHEMICALS IN MILK,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/chemicals-in-milk,"JULY 11, 2011","A new study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry confirms what many already know: a glass of milk contains much more than a dose of calcium. The Spanish-Moroccan team of researchers analyzed 20 samples of cow, goat, and human breast milk from Spain and Morocco, and found growth hormones, painkillers, and antibiotics in each. The cows’ milk, in particular, contained the most, including a form of the sex hormone estrogen and chemicals used in painkillers. While the doses found were too small to cause any affect on drinkers, researchers say tests such as these are important for food safety. "

IOWA’S UNDERCOVER LAW,https://vegnews.com/2011/7/iowas-undercover-law,"JULY 7, 2011","A recent article in The Atlantic looks at the likelihood that Iowa’s failed bill to criminalize undercover investigations at factory farms will reappear in the state’s next legislative session. The proposed bill easily passed in the Iowa House, but the Senate session closed without a decision. The agribusiness interests that supported the bill, including Monsanto, DuPont, and the Iowa Poultry Association, have reason to hope for its resurrection, as The Atlantic piece points out, because the bill truly targets the systematic cruelties inherent to the factory farming of animals, not the exceptionally cruel “recreational abuse” that many undercover investigations capture.

The next step, the article states, is less invasive forms of sterilization such as pills, implants, and vaccines for cats and dogs. "

VEGAN SUNSCREEN GUIDE,https://vegnews.com/2011/6/vegan-sunscreen-guide,"JUNE 26, 2011","Sunscreen, like watermelon and Fourth of July fireworks, is a summertime essential. This sunburn- and cancer-fighting product comes in more tubes, sprays, and sticks and with more SPFs, bells, and whistles than any consumer knows what to do with. Finding an effective sunscreen that’s cruelty free? That might leave you in the drugstore aisle for hours. We help you spend less time buying bottles and more time enjoying the sun safely by explaining what’s on those labels and which ones are animal-friendly. SPF, Simply
More than 2 million people in the US are treated for skin cancer each year. Those of us (read: all of us) who don’t want to be one of the millions need to know exactly what is going on with sunscreen. Most of us choose a tube based on its sun protection factor, or SPF, which supposedly indicates how many minutes the sunscreen will protect you from UVB rays only. UVA rays, not so much. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the first time in more than three decades, released new guidelines on sunscreens in an effort to prevent companies from making dubious claims about their products. The new rules include a requirement that sunscreens equally protect against UVA rays (long-wave rays that can cause skin aging and might initiate the development of skin cancer), and UVB rays (short-wave rays that are the main culprit of sunburn and is the major initiator of skin cancer) in order to be considered “broad spectrum.” In addition, sunscreens can no longer claim to be “waterproof,” “sweatproof,” or be called “sunblock.” Lastly, the FDA is proposing capping SPFs at “SPF 50+” because those above 50 offer little more protection with each SPF number increase. The policy change, which will take place in one year, is industry changing and much needed in a $680-million domestic business that, until now, had essentially no rules whatsoever. Safe Screens
While the FDA’s new rules are a welcome change for the industry and will help consumers buy products that will truly protect them, there are other dangers to be aware of. Some of the chemicals used to make sunscreens can be as harmful to you as the UVA and UVB rays you’re trying to protect yourself against. We tackle some of these hormone-disrupting, cancer-causing chemicals in our July+August 2011 piece, “Skin Deep.” The Environmental Working Group is also committed to finding a truly healthy sunscreen; their 2011 Sunscreen Guide is available online and sorts through more than 1,700 screens, lip balms, and moisturizers, rating them one (the best) through eight (the worst). Some of VN’s favorite cruelty-free finds (that also have great scores on the Sunscreen Guide) include Loving Naturals SPF 30+ Suncreen, Jason Natural Cosmetics SPF 30 Mineral Sunblock, Elemental Herbs SPF 20 Sunscreen Sport, and UV Natural SPF 30+ Lip Sunscreen for protecting your pout. Make sure to really lather it on, as SPF ratings are based on a thick application of sunscreen—about three tablespoons every two hours is recommended by experts. No matter which sunscreen you decide on for summertime, don’t forget that the best sun protection includes a hat and cover up as well (or a strategically placed umbrella). Enjoy the sunshine! "

I think a glove is a tool. A glove is our tool, a tool we use every day, and it may as well fit.” While some players use gloves made from a combination of synthetic materials and leather, Gordon is believed to be the first to use a completely synthetic glove.

LOCAL VS. MEATLESS: BETTER CHOICE,https://vegnews.com/2011/6/local-vs-meatless-better-choice,"JUNE 23, 2011","Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have answered the question of whether locally sourced food or eating meat less often is better for the environment. The winner? Going veg. A 2008 study that resurfaced in the news this week analyzed the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production and distribution, and found that while food is transported thousands of miles, only 11 percent of a US household’s carbon footprint for food is from the transportation of that food; 83 percent is from growing and producing it and four percent is final delivery (from producer to store). Red meat is the worst of the bunch, requiring 150 times more energy to produce than even chicken or fish. “Thus,” the abstract states, “we suggest that a dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average household’s food-related climate footprint than ‘buying local.’” "

VEGAN POKER PLAYER,https://vegnews.com/2011/6/vegan-poker-player,"JUNE 21, 2011","Meet Ed Miller—professional poker player and five-year vegan. He recently attended the first-annual Vegans in Vegas Conference, where he lives with his wife, and (you guessed it) plays poker at a professional level, writes books on the subject, and eats good vegan food. VN caught up with Miller, just after Vegans in Vegas.
 
VegNews: Tell us about why you decided to go vegan.
Ed Miller: It was a 10-year process. The ball started rolling in college when I became a fan of a band from Canada called Propagandhi. Those guys are relentlessly pro-animal, and listening to them was the first time I ever really thought about the problems with consuming animals. In 2002, my mom had a heart attack, and I went to the doctor and found out I was headed the same way if I didn’t make a lifestyle change. So I stopped eating meat. In 2004, I met my wife, Elaine Vigneault, who was also a vegetarian. In 2006, we moved to New York, and with all the great resources for vegans in that city, Elaine and I took the plunge and became vegan together. Five years later we’re back in Vegas, still happily married, proudly vegan, and my doctor assures me that, thanks to my diet, I’m not going to have a heart attack any time soon.
 
VN: That’s great! Do your poker playing and veganism go hand-in-hand, or do you tend to keep them separate in your life?
EM: Veganism is, among other things, a statement that we should not exploit those weaker than us simply because we can turn a profit from it. Poker, on the other hand, demands that you attack the weak, and relish the profit you can make from it. Of course, the weak at my Las Vegas poker tables often own multimillion-dollar bank accounts, so you can’t feel too bad for them. Having said all that, most of the other vegans I know who play poker are pretty darn good at it.
 
VN: That’s a really interesting way to look at the two subjects. Speaking of the game, what is your recipe for success when playing poker?
EM: Patience, restraint, open-mindedness, and the committment to learn something new every day. In poker, most things are out of your control. You don’t control what cards come. More importantly, you don’t control the other players. You can’t make them think or do something just because it would be convenient for you. You only control yourself, and the key is to do that as well as you can. If you do, if you accept that no matter how much you know, there is always something new to learn, and if you commit to learning every day, then you will succeed.
 
VN: Thanks for the advice, which I think goes for other areas in life as well. You currently live in Las Vegas. Do you find it to be an easy place to live as a vegan?
EM: I lived in New York for two years, and compared to the lush environment of the Big Apple, Las Vegas is a vegan desert (har har). But it’s not really fair to compare like that. Las Vegas has a thriving and active veg community. New veg-friendly restaurants are popping up, and old restaurants are becoming more veg-friendly. Elaine organizes group called Vegas Veg* that has more than 500 members, and sponsors meetups nearly every week for the veg crowd. I’d say it’s plenty easy to live as a vegan in Vegas.
 
VN: Where is your favorite place to dine and get vegan grub?
EM: Red Velvet Café. It’s café-type food—sandwiches, wraps, salads, pasta, and so forth. Unfortunately, they serve meat and dairy, but they are happy to veganize anything on the menu, and they do it very well. Also, they always have a wide selection of fantastic vegan desserts. The original location is a bit hard to get to for out-of-towners, but they just opened an outpost on the Strip inside the Fashion Show Mall. Definitely worth checking out. Also, Ronald’s Donuts. No explanation necessary.
 
VN: For vegan doughnuts? No explanation needed, indeed! You recently attended the first annual Vegans in Vegas Conference. How was it?
EM: It was great! Ryan and Jennifer Henn did a terrific job organizing it. Any excuse to come to Vegas is a good one, but meeting up with vegheads from around the country is naturally a fantastic one. Next year, it would be cool to explore more of what Vegas has to offer off the Strip. There are some hikes just outside of town that would make for great events.
 
VN: Any projects planned for the near future?
EM: My sixth poker book, How to Read Hands at No-Limit Hold ‘em, comes out at the end of summer. Check out my website for more info. After that’s finished, I plan to write more for Vegan Soapbox. It’s a great resource for vegans and non-vegans who want to learn more about animal issues, veganism, advocacy, and more. I’m also working on a novel. It’s a thriller, and one of the main characters is a vegan computer hacker and poker player who saves the world. It’s going to be awesome. I promise. "

Feinstein’s constituents told her about their 12-year-old son who succumbed to an infection that could not be treated by antibiotics. PAMTA will limit the agricultural use of seven types of antibiotics that the Food and Drug Administration has declared “critically important” in human medicine. Congresswoman Louise Slaughter (D-NY) has introduced a similar bill in Congress; the measure currently has 60 House cosponsors. "

VEGAN STATE FAIR CONTEST,https://vegnews.com/2011/6/vegan-state-fair-contest,"JUNE 14, 2011","State fairs are typically the territory of livestock auctions, deep-fried Twinkies, and other non-vegan staples.

HEALTH FOOD MYTHS,https://vegnews.com/2011/6/health-food-myths,"JUNE 13, 2011","When it comes to eating healthy, two recent studies shed light on Americans’ eating habits when dining out and choosing dietary options. According to a study by the NPD group, about 55 percent of people 25 to 49 years old expect that healthier fare should cost exactly the same as regular menu items. Seventy percent of people surveyed over the age of 50 said they wouldn’t be willing to pay more for nutritious meals, whereas 30 percent of consumers aged 18 to 24 agreed to paying premium prices for quality wholesome offerings. A separate study illustrates that most dieters equate healthy adjectives to health food rather than reading ingredient labels. For example, participants who consider themselves dieters in the study by University of South Carolina researchers ate more candy labeled “fruit chews” than “candy chews,” believing the fruit chew to be a better option.

While reactions drawn from both vegans and omnivores ranged from harsh criticism to full support (and all points in between), the Humane Society of the United States President and CEO Wayne Pacelle took to his blog to acknowledge that while sympathizing with the animals who’ve been slaughtered by Zuckerberg is natural, the majority of Americans never face the animals whose lives end to be consumed, and Zuckerberg has provided a flashpoint for considering their own eating habits, especially when animals are involved. "
MYPLATE: THE VEGAN REACTION,https://vegnews.com/2011/6/myplate-the-vegan-reaction,"JUNE 12, 2011","When the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) unveiled MyPlate, the decades-old food pyramid became nothing but an ancient relic. Ideally, MyPlate simplifies the idea of healthier eating for Americans from three to 93. But is it a success? We reached out to prominent vegan medical professionals to find out. Mealtime Makeover
The new MyPlate design is simple and straightforward—an illustrated dinner plate broken into the four food groups—fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein (as opposed to the pyramid’s “Meat and Beans”)—plus a cup for dairy and MyPyramid’s sixth group, “Oil,” nixed all together. In addition, the USDA created a new website—choosemyplate.gov—with more guidelines, such as “Make at least half your grains whole grains,” and “Drink water instead of sugary drinks.” Officials believe the simpler design, in addition to a healthy eating campaign, will translate into easier, healthier choices at the dinner table. Of Milk and Meat
Easier, yes. But is MyPlate really sending the right message? While filling half the plate with fruit and vegetables and suggesting whole grains have been applauded by vegan medical professionals, Dr. Neal Barnard, president of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), believes MyPlate’s protein and dairy groups present some “serious problems.” Barnard, among others, worries that Americans will see the “protein” label and immediately assume “meat,” assuming they cannot receive protein from plant-based sources. Food-policy expert Michele Simon takes the argument further, noting the inconsistent message of MyPlate. “They recommend ‘protein’ but then why is ‘dairy’ and not ‘calcium’ recommended?” Unfortunately, many Americans do not realize non-dairy sources provide calcium. “There is an abundance of calcium found in plant foods such as leafy greens (especially collard greens, kale, broccoli, and bok choy), dried figs, sesame seeds, tahini, and calcium-set tofu,” says Julieanna Hever, a certified plant-based nutritionist. “It is because of this isolationism of nutrients that the majority of people are confused about what they are actually supposed to eat.” The Red Tape
What is comes down to, according to Dr. Michael Greger, director of public health and animal agriculture for the Humane Society of the United States, is politics. “The mandate of the USDA includes both promoting agribusiness and, at the same time, giving dietary advice. This may explain why in the 30 years agency officials have been issuing dietary guidelines, their ‘eat more’ messaging has been clear: ‘increase intake of fruits and vegetables,’ whereas their ‘eat less’ recommendations only refer to biochemical components: ‘Reduce intake of solid fats (major sources of saturated and trans fatty acids).’” Many high-level USDA appointees have agribusiness ties, which may lead to biased guidance for the American consumer. As Greger explains, the effect of that guidance partly determines what is served both in school and at home. At Face Value
A combination of public education and organizational change is needed for Americans to receive the right eating advice. “The USDA needs to cut its ties to commercial interests or create a third party that is one hundred percent scientific to make nutrition recommendations,” says Hever. “Until there is no financial link, the USDA cannot be unbiased and provide objective health information.” Simon says it boils down to a simple fact: “Education alone will not improve dietary habits.” She suggests a shift in policy, as opposed to letting Americans “choose” their plate—“Never mind that for too many Americans, the choices in their neighborhood range from McDonald’s to Burger King”—is needed to alter people’s physical environment, including overhauls of agricultural policy and addressing food marketing, especially towards children. Being a well educated, discerning consumer will win out in the end, but Americans looking to MyPlate as the be-all, end-all of healthy eating might not be getting the whole story. "

TIPS FOR THE BEST VEGAN TRESSES,https://vegnews.com/2011/6/tips-for-the-best-vegan-tresses,"JUNE 5, 2011","While it remains largely undecided whether blondes, brunettes, redheads, or even the Manic Panic devotees have more fun, it’s well-known that many tresses are less-than-natural in shade. Switching from caramel brown to crimson red is no new feat, but is your hair-color habit harmful?

The FDA does not approve cosmetics before they hit the market, meaning that manufacturers call the shots when it comes to determining which products are safe. Most commercially available permanent hair colors come with a laundry list of unpronounceable carcinogenic chemicals, including the infamous p-Phenylenediamine (PPD). Present in many permanent dyes, this chemical is the culprit in a number of severe allergic reaction cases, even after users passed the skin-allergy test. There are plenty of non-toxic and environmentally friendly hair-color options, and choosing which to use depends mainly on the effects you’re hoping to achieve.

Pretty in Plants
If you’re looking for subtle variations of color—and don’t mind a bit of a sticky, stinky mess—henna is the way to go. This plant-derived substance has been used for thousands of years, touting fans like Cleopatra. Plan in advance—Light Mountain Hair Color recommends letting the dye cure for one to three hours before application. LUSH Henna suggests leaving their dye on for one to six hours, depending on your desired shade, making henna a worthy but time-consuming choice. You can expect the effects to last from four to eight weeks, and might enjoy experimenting with different mix-ins like coffee, black tea, or lemon juice to customize your color. As an added bonus, henna serves as an excellent conditioner for hair.

At-Home Alternatives
For a greater variety of color, natural food stores carry brands like Herbatint, Tints of Nature, and NaturColor. While none of these are completely chemical free, they are cruelty-free and safer for the environment. The process is similar to mainstream over-the-counter kits, relying on the mixing of a few potent potions before application. All three offer permanent and semi-permanent herbal formulas, without the harsh effects—and stench—of ammonia, a toxic chemical that causes structural damage to hair. Tints of Nature also boasts certified organic ingredients, wrapped up in recyclable and compostible packaging.

Salon Styling
Like the idea of a natural alternative but don’t want to deal with the mess in your bathroom? Don’t resign yourself to a life of au naturel locks just yet. Aveda salons use their own all-vegan hair color; prices vary by location, but expect to spend more for professional services. To steer clear of ammonia, you’ll want to avoid their permanent colors. Just chat with your stylist and explain you’d prefer semi-permanent instead. Even if you live in an area where there’s nothing but conventional salons, hair stylist John Masters suggests buying a natural hair color, taking it in to the salon, and asking the stylist to apply it for you.

Next time you’re itching for a color switch, consider seeking out one of these cruelty-free choices. As an added bonus, rest assured that your beauty fix isn’t toxic, carcinogenic, or harmful to the environment.

Disaster-Free DIY
—Check the fine print before using permanent dye on henna-colored hair or vice versa—the interaction could cause unwanted results.
—Make sure hair is free of all styling products before application.
—Generously apply a thick lotion on and around hairline to prevent skin staining.
—Opt for the skin-patch and strand test no matter how eager you are to get started. With hair color, it’s definitely better to be safe than sorry. "
NEW FOOD GUIDE,https://vegnews.com/2011/6/new-food-guide,"JUNE 4, 2011","Late last week, the US Department of Agriculture, along with first lady Michelle Obama, introduced MyPlate, a new, more literal way to think about proper nutrition at mealtime. Fruits and vegetables cover half of the new plate; the other half includes grains and protein (versus the old recommendation of meat, or only animal-based protein). In addition, a small circle above the plate serves as a recommendation for dairy. The USDA hopes the simple design will better grab America’s attention at the table.

10 MUST-READ VEG BOOKS,https://vegnews.com/2011/5/10-must-read-veg-books,"MAY 31, 2011","Looking for a great summer pastime or trying to spend less hours in front of a screen? Cozy up to pages full of gripping stories, plain facts, and persuasive arguments in our list of 10 must-read veg and veg-friendly books.  The China Study
One of the most comprehensive nutritional studies ever conducted, T. Colin Campbell’s and Thomas M. Campbell II’s The China Study is a classic in the vegan world. A compilation of facts and findings on how eating a plant-based diet reduces the risk of cancer, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes, this book is helpful for newbie and veteran vegans alike. Diet for a New America
In Diet for a New America, John Robbins exposes the horrors of America’s factory farms, detailing everything from how our society became “protein obsessed” to debunking a variety of myths surrounding what we eat. Even meat-loving omnivores can’t help but reevaluate their dietary choices after reading Robbins’ powerful tome.  Eating Animals
Often known as the book that made notable celebrities go veg, Eating Animals captures the stories behind our eating habits. Investigations of factory farming, tales from his childhood, philosophical musings, and scientific evidence all abound in Jonathan Safran Foer’s page-turning dissection of the way we eat.  My Year of Meats
If you’re looking for a plot-based veg read, then Ruth Ozeki’s novel is the perfect world in which to retreat. My Year of Meats tells the story of a woman employed to make the beef industry look good on television. After learning more, she rebels, and with the help of another woman, works to expose the beef industry’s negative practices.  The Bond
Wayne Pacelle, CEO and president of The Humane Society of the United States, writes about our relationship with animals in his debut book. Though recently published, The Bond has become an instant must-read for anyone interested in ethical veganism and animal protection. Mad Cowboy
Cattle rancher-turned-vegetarian Howard Lyman not only outlines why he went veg, but also uncovers the dangers of the cattle and dairy industry from an insider perspective. Lyman was initially a proponent for chemical farming technique, pumping his cows with hormones and antibiotics. After realizing the errors in his ways, Lyman along with co-author Glen Merzer wrote Mad Cowboy as a wake-up call for Americans to think more carefully about the food they consume. The Jungle
Written more than a century ago, The Jungle still rings true today. While Upton Sinclair’s book focuses on the story of a Lithuanian immigrant who comes to America to fulfill his dreams of wealth and opportunity, it is also well-known for its depiction of the early 20th century meatpacking industry. The novel was also partly responsible for the initiation of the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906. Animal Liberation
Peter Singer’s watershed work debuted in 1975 and has inspired countless people to adopt a vegan diet since then. Based in utilitarian philosophy, the book is often credited with starting the modern animal-rights movement. Sistah Vegan
A. Breeze Harper beautifully ties a number of social justice issues together in her debut book, Sistah Vegan. Not only are food politics addressed, Harper also explores how identity, feminism, anti-racism, eco-sustainability, sexuality, decolonization, animal rights, and more play into the vegan experience in America.  The Kind Diet
Actress Alicia Silverstone shares how and why she went veg, the life-altering benefits she experienced, teaching readers to go veg by “flirting” with it before diving in. Silverstone’s compassion is evident through her simultaneously encouraging and informational words, and it will definitely rub off in reading The Kind Diet. "

CARBON OFFSETTING,https://vegnews.com/2011/5/carbon-offsetting,"MAY 29, 2011","With summer less than a month away, many of us are knee-deep in travel-planning mode. Whether it’s off to a family reunion, flying south to spend Fourth of July on the beach, or hitting the road with friends, a GPS, and a cooler full of snacks, it’s highly likely that carbon footprint will rise with summertime temperatures. Fortunately, there are ways that you can offset those gas-station gallons and sky-high miles—here’s how. CO2 101
What is a carbon footprint, anyway? Simply put, an individual’s carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide (or CO2) that is released into the air due to the individual’s consumption of fossil fuels. But what’s so bad about carbon dioxide? Carbon dioxide is one of earth’s greenhouse gasses—water vapor, ozone, and methane are others—that exist in our atmosphere and absorb heat. While greenhouse gasses are important for the regulation of the earth’s temperature, deforestation, and fossil-fuel use, among other activities, create an abundance of these gasses. Since this “extra” CO2 (which accounts for roughly 60 percent of the greenhouse effect) cannot escape the atmosphere, it becomes trapped, where it collects heat, thereby increasing the global temperature (hence: global warming). While some debate the existence of global warming and its effects, almost daily reports speak of the harm of rising global temperatures, including melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and damaged (or depleted) ecosystems, and food-supply shortages. What’s Your Score?
It’s easy to find out how much your summer trip is going to cost the planet, and you can find out how much your daily commute does too. By being vegan, you’re already helping to save tons (literally) of carbon dioxide from being emitted per year—according to a University of Chicago study, a vegan produces 1.5 fewer tons of CO2 or CO2 equivalents than a person who eats the average North American diet. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t worry about that trip to the beach. The average roundtrip cross-country flight emits roughly 4,200 pounds of CO2. Whether you’re using a plane or your auto for your summer vacation, Native Energy’s carbon footprint calculator can help you find out your impact. For flights, simply put in the airports you are traveling between. For autos, input your car’s mileage, fuel-economy class, and miles per gallon, as well as your trip locations, and it calculates your carbon dioxide emissions in tons. How to Help
Fortunately, there’s no need to feel guilty about your vacation. Carbon offsets can be purchased to literally help offset the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted by air travel, driving, electricity use, and other sources. Offsets include financial support of renewable energy projects, energy-efficiency projects, planting trees, and other projects: You can buy offsets at TerraPass and a multitude of other organizations and companies. For example, a round-trip drive from New York, NY, to Charleston, SC, in a sedan will emit roughly 0.72 tons of carbon dioxide into the air. Less than $11 in carbon offsets equal that amount. That’s the same as a weekend of soy lattes! In fact, Continental Airlines, Travelocity, Enterprise Holdings (which includes Enterprise Rent-a-Car, Alamo, and others) and more all offer carbon offsetting programs for their customers. In addition, Carbonfund.org not only provides carbon footprint calculators, but also provides tips for reducing your footprint and carbon offsets. It’s important that we take good care of our planet, just as we do ourselves. This summer, make the extra step to offset your travel plans, and reduce your impact on our precious home. "

AUTHOR SAYWARD REBHAL,https://vegnews.com/2011/5/author-sayward-rebhal,"MAY 24, 2011","With a youngster in tow, a popular blog to maintain, books to write, and a Portland-based home to nourish, Sayward Rebhal is one busy vegan. Her blog, Bonzai Aphrodite, details her vegan lifestyle and provides advice and support for anyone interested in everything from raw recipes to urban farming to ethical fashion. Plus, the witty, personal posts are in the vein of a good friend sharing all her expeditions and newfound interests (a weekly love list includes a diversity of things such as “My crazy raw kitchen laboratory,” azaleas, family time, and powdered peanut butter). VN catches up with the multitasking lady. VegNews: Your blog, Bonzai Aphrodite, is dedicated to covering everything about being vegan. How were you first introduced to veganism and what made you choose this lifestyle?
Sayward Rebhal: It all began as a cleanse. I’d spent over a year slowly disentangling myself from a decade-long love affair with cigarettes, and I used food as my coping mechanism. That was a conscious decision, and it worked, but it meant I ate a ton of truly awful stuff. So I decided to go vegan for a seven-day “reset.” At the end of the week I was blown away by how much I enjoyed it and more importantly, how incredibly easy it was. From there, I felt like the only way to move forward with my integrity intact was to do so as a vegan. Best accident ever! VN: The Vegan Pregnancy Survival Guide, your first book, is due to hit shelves this summer. What inspired you to write it and what was the process like?
SR: When I got pregnant in the summer of 2009, I did what every newly pregnant woman does—I went to the bookstore! I couldn’t believe what I found. Or actually, what I didn’t find. The word vegan is completely absent from the pregnancy section. So basically, I wrote this book to fill a big gaping hole. I wrote the book I wanted to read—a straightforward, supportive, science-based-but-not-so-serious guidebook for navigating vegan pregnancy. I cover everything from gracefully deflecting ignorant inquiries to which acid reflux meds are tested on animals. And of course, there’s lots of food and nutrition info. The process has been pretty comical, really. My son is only 14 months old, so most of my writing is accomplished while nursing a sleeping baby. I pretty much typed the entire book with one hand. I really think the book is going to help empower women in their pregnancies, and I’m so excited about that. VN: What’s your best advice for women who want to stay vegan during pregnancy?
SR: It’s not so much advice as encouragement, which is simply: You can do it! Don’t let anyone—well-intentioned family, old-fashioned doctors, or a concerned partner—tell you that you can’t. There’s a lot of ridiculous misinformation out there, and it’s created a lot of unnecessary fear. Remember that you’re a bit of a trailblazer in this whole vegan pregnancy thing, and sometimes forging ahead can mean feeling alone. Networking with other vegan moms is also an invaluable form of support and it can really make all the difference. VN: The photos on your site are stunning, the recipes are great, and the fashion is adorable. How do you balance everything from running your blog to writing books to being a mom?
SR: Balance is something I’m always striving for, but I can’t claim that I’ve achieved it yet. I’m a fiercely motivated person, a total workhorse, and I’ll drive myself into a high-stress tailspin if I’m not careful. My husband has affectionately diagnosed me with Hyper-Productivity Disorder. That’s great for churning out high-quality content, but it’s not always great for a high-quality life. I’ve gotten a lot better at learning how to slow down—motherhood has been great for that—but it’s still a central part of my journey. VN: You also just announced that you’re going to write a raw cookbook. Tell us about it.
SR: I’m not a raw foodist but I really, really adore raw foods and I’ve been flirting with the lifestyle on my blog for years. A few months back I was approached by Adams Media and asked to act as curator for an upcoming un-cookbook; the largest collection of 100-percent raw, vegan recipes ever compiled in one place. How could I say no? It’s due out next winter and it’s been a blast to work on, since work involves eating massive amounts of raw cheesecake. VN: Any other new projects—blog, book, or otherwise—for the future?
SR: I’ve recently registered compassionatefamilies.com because I want to create an online information hub where vegan families from all over the world can connect and be inspired. It’s going to be a community with contributor-driven content, featuring articles from dieticians to doctors to stay-at-home vegan moms. Hopefully it will be up by early next year! "
VEGAN GUIDE TO HEALTHY SKIN & HAIR,https://vegnews.com/2011/5/vegan-guide-to-healthy-skin-andamp-hair,"MAY 24, 2011","Whether your skin is pale or dark, your hair straw or chocolate, taking care of both this summer is imperative for your health (not to mention your scrapbook-worthy photos). With SPFs reaching into the hundreds and hair dyes everywhere, it is important to know what works when it comes to sun care. We’ve gathered some guidelines and tips so that you can spend less time worrying about your sunscreen and more time enjoying the sunshine. Summer Skin Success
While they sure do look nice on, it is a universal truth that there’s no such thing as a safe tan. With rates of skin cancer rising (there were more than 1 million new cases of skin cancer in the US in 2010, according to the National Cancer Institute), especially among young women, it is more important than ever to make sure you are protecting your body’s largest organ. A cover-up and a hat with a brim large enough to cover your entire face and neck is the very best protection. After that, it’s sunscreen, folks. Since the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate the ingredients that go into sunscreen, check out the Environmental Working Group’s list of the safest sunscreens available. Both Alba Botanica and Desert Essence’s vegan mineral sunscreens make the list, and Hurraw!’s new lip balm with SPF should be worn 24–7. Can’t live without that sun-kissed summer glow? Get tan the fake (and cruelty-free) way with California North Titanium Self Tanner or Dermalogica’s Protective Self Tan (both of which use new, cleaner formulations). Hair Today, Here Tomorrow
The top of your head might not be a top priority when heading out to a summer festival, but it should be. Heat, light, humidity, and water (both salty and chlorinated) can do big-time damage to your tresses, regardless of whether or not those blonde locks are courtesy of your genes or a great colorist. The key is moisturizer. Use conditioner at every wash, and try to wash it fewer times, as your hair will benefit from the natural oils your scalp creates over time. If you know you’re going to be in the sun without a hat, coat your mop with leave-in conditioner like Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner from Giovanni Cosmetics or hair sunscreen such as Aveda Sun Care Protection Hair Veil before going out. Use cool water to wash your hair after a long day in the sun, and make sure to keep your body hydrated while you’re at it. Lastly, avoid products that contain formaldehyde or alcohol. Just In Case
We’ve all been there: you’ve done your very best to avoid harmful rays—hat, sunscreen, reapplication, the whole kit and kaboodle—but somehow the sun won, leaving you with a painful sunburn. While unfortunately there’s no quick fix, you can cure a nasty burn with three steps: cool, moisturize, and take a pain reliever. After applying a cold compress to the affected area, use an alcohol-free moisturizer such as LUSH’s Dream Cream Body Lotion, JR Watkins’ Lemon Cream Lotion, or all-natural aloe vera. Make sure to avoid products with benzocaine, an anesthetic found in some sunburn treatment products that has been linked to a condition that decreases the amount of oxygen the blood can carry. With these tips, everything from mornings at the farmers’ market to vacations at the beach will be a body-care breeze (and here’s hoping for real breezes, too!). "

ALL ABOUT HEMP,https://vegnews.com/2011/5/all-about-hemp,"MAY 8, 2011","The second annual Hemp History Week might have just ended, but we couldn’t help but focus on this versatile and misunderstood plant for a bit longer. A member of the Cannabaceae family, hemp can help make anything from T-shirts to ice cream bars, and so much more. A Little History
Hemp, or Cannabis sativa, is a member of the Cannabaceae family, related to hops and hackberry trees. When most people think of hemp, they might think of the psychoactive drug marijuana, but there are two separate strains—hallucinogenic hemp (which contains the psychoactive chemical tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC), and industrial hemp, which contains less than one percent of THC. Humans have been cultivating the plant for more than 10,000 years—in fact, one of the oldest pieces of evidence of human existence is a piece of hemp fabric that was determined to be from around 8,000 BC. Today, countries throughout the world grow and harvest the plant for everything from paper to cereal. A Bad Name
Hemp was a part of United States history before the country even existed. The Puritans brought the plant to New England in the 17th century as a fabric source, and by colonial times, farms in Virginia were required to grow the crop. In fact, Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence on hemp paper. It was in 1937, with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act, that the growing of industrial or hallucinogenic hemp (the Drug Enforcement Administration considers both types of Cannabis sativa marijuana) was essentially banned in the US. During WWII, the plant was grown again as a replacement for abaca and jute, but soon after the war, restrictions were reinstated. Today, the United States is the only industrialized nation in the world that does not produce industrial hemp—almost all of the plant used in the US is imported. Seventy years later, many Americans—even lawmakers—are trying to legalize industrial hemp. As a part of this year’s Hemp History Week, Representative Ron Paul submitted a statement in the official Congressional Record supporting the use of industrial hemp, and plans to reintroduce the Industrial Hemp Farming Act later this year. A Million Ways
Hemp, by all intents and purposes, is nothing short of a wonder plant. Acre-for-acre, it can produce four times the amount of fiber of an average wood forest, and can re-grow itself even faster—the time from seed to harvest is approximately 120 days without need of herbicides or pesticides. The plant is also a nutritional powerhouse, providing omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, vitamins and minerals such as vitamin E and iron, and is a complete protein. Paper, oil, bread, milk, salad dressings, purses, clothing, waffles, ice cream, even building materials can be made from hemp. According to the Hemp Industries Association, hemp products are one of the fastest-growing natural products in the United States, with estimated sales of $400 million in 2010. Hemp has come a long way from colonial farms and hippie communes. While it still cannot be grown legally in the United States, you can enjoy its many benefits with the ever-growing range of hemp products on store shelves. "

FORKS OVER KNIVES,https://vegnews.com/2011/5/forks-over-knives,"MAY 5, 2011","For the better part of the last few years, our nation’s “health care crisis” has dominated daily news and done its fair share of fear mongering among the US population. With each newscast, ominous music plays in the background as frightening buzzwords are spouted off: childhood obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. As the country looked toward Washington for answers, Brian Wendel, Lee Fulkerson, and their crew took the road less traveled by mainstream media, putting the finishing touches on a project determined to tell the world about a revolutionary—and simple—solution to its ailing health: Focus on your fork, and soon forget the cost of going under the knife. Forks Over Knives, Wendel’s first feature-length documentary, explores the powerful correlation between diet and disease, and the conclusion is hard to dispute. The film focuses on the groundbreaking research of T. Colin Campbell, PhD, and Caldwell Esselstyn, Jr., MD. Raised to revere milk as “nature’s perfect food,” both men discovered alarming facts about its relation to disease, along with other animal products, through years of research. When the two finally met, the combination of Campbell’s scientific data with Esselstyn’s clinical trials solidified their conclusion: the Standard American Diet is killing us. Campbell’s powerful publication, The China Study, lies at the root of the film. “I knew there was a fair amount of research that whole-foods, plant-based nutrition can prevent—and in many cases reverse—disease, but I didn’t know the extent of it until I read The China Study,” Wendel says. In the end, he left his 14-year career in real estate, hired the most talented film crew he could find, and set out to make Forks Over Knives. Lee Fulkerson, writer and director, was hesitant to join the project at first. At the time, Fulkerson’s own diet consisted of multiple energy drinks and sodas—approximately four for breakfast—to make it through his hectic days, until dinnertime delivered a fast-food double cheeseburger, onion rings, and chocolate shake. In an unexpected twist, Fulkerson joins the ranks of the film’s “reality patients,” seeking to improve his own well-being. Joey Aucoin is another featured patient who adopts a plant-based diet in the film, beginning the experiment with a laundry list of ailments, including high cholesterol (320 to be exact), type 2 diabetes, and high risk for both heart attack and stroke. His medication set him back roughly $200 a month, in addition to the cost of his health insurance. He embodied one of the film’s featured proverbs: “One-quarter of what you eat keeps you alive. The other three-quarters keeps your doctor alive.” At the end of his trial, Aucoin had lost weight, lowered his cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugars, and successfully ditched all nine drugs he was taking. The patients’ personalities paired with an intimate look at the lives of Campbell and Esselstyn give the film a relatable, anecdotal edge to gently guide viewers through the compelling science. “We wanted to tell stories, because that’s how information sticks with people. We didn’t want to have a talking-heads documentary,” Wendel says. As production of the film proceeded, similar changes began spreading through the rest of the crew. Every person on the core team adopted a plant-based diet, including the producer, co-producer, and interns. Based on the omnivorous crew’s initial reactions, as well as the positive response at screenings, Forks Over Knives is striking a chord. But it isn’t purposeful shock value or scare tactics that drives Forks. Both ends of the spectrum are represented in an effort to achieve a credible, even-handed tone. “I personally don’t like telling people what to do, but this film is about giving people the information so they can make truly informed decisions,” Wendel says. With advanced screenings in cities across the US, the movie is set to be officially released May 6. “It’s really easy to be negative, and in this film we focus on the positive. This is a message of hope; all we have to do is go down the right aisle in the supermarket,” Wendel says. "

Last week, YouTube removed the video over concerns of sensational, graphic images, and said that any such videos should be “balanced” with educational information. In response, MFA’s Executive Director Nathan Runkle wrote an open letter to YouTube’s CEO, noting, “Silencing one side of the debate over how farmed animals should be treated flies in the face of democracy.” The letter continues, “YouTube seems to be sending a message that hurting animals for fun or profit is acceptable but speaking out against such abuses is not.” According to MFA, YouTube has now reinstated the video.

GREEN SPRING CLEANING,https://vegnews.com/2011/5/green-spring-cleaning,"MAY 3, 2011","With spring well underway, many have started the closet-clearing, floor-wiping, clutter-reducing process known as spring cleaning (and if you haven’t started, you’ve at least started thinking about it). What you might not know is that many of the sprays and soaps you use could be causing you and the planet harm. Check out what’s really in those household cleaners, learn about greener options, and find out what grocery-store staples can help you clean your house. Airborne Offenders
According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, household-cleaning substances are one of the top categories most often involved in human exposures to poison, representing roughly 8.5 percent of reported poison-control calls in 2009. Some of the main offenders include toilet bowl cleaner, corrosive drain de-clogger, and oven cleaner, which can cause severe burns both externally and if ingested. These products often contain ammonia and bleach, which can produce dangerous, toxic fumes, especially if combined with chemicals from other cleaners. In addition to bodily harm, many cleaning products are also harmful to the environment. Once they’re finished cleaning your kitchen, these products travel down drains into waterways, where they pollute water sources and harm wildlife. In addition, detergents (found in most cleaners) include ingredients called surfactants. Most surfactants are made with petroleum, a fossil fuel whose extraction is costly to the planet, releasing greenhouse gases and increasing our dependence on oil. Safe Sprays
Steer clear of dangerous chemicals by choosing products that are both bodily and environmentally friendly. According to the Environmental Working Group, there are seven major ingredients to check for (and avoid!) when purchasing cleaning products. Moreover, Good Housekeeping tested many products to find out which ones were both kind to the earth and tough on grime. Some of VN’s favorite cruelty-free brands include Poppy’s Naturally Clean, which uses all-natural and non-toxic ingredients such as vinegar and tea tree oil, Method, which uses biodegradable ingredients made from corn and coconut, and Seventh Generation, a line of laundry, home-cleaning, and personal-care products that are non-toxic and biodegradable. Natural Options
Next time you need to clean your countertop, look no further than your kitchen cupboard for the necessary tools. Three items most likely already in your kitchen can do plenty of damage to scum, dirt, and grime. When it’s time to do laundry, baking soda can help deodorize and soften your t-shirts and jeans—just throw a smidge onto a dryer sheet along with your wet clothes. For counters, bathtubs, toilets, even the fridge, vinegar is another all-natural, cheap, and safe choice. This liquid has natural antimicrobial properties, but don’t worry—its strong smell will disappear once it dries. Similar to vinegar, the natural acids in lemon juice make it a powerful cleaner as well. It also works as a wood polisher—add one part lemon juice to two parts olive oil for wood floors and furniture you can see your reflection in. There is no need to put yourself or the planet in harm’s way during spring cleaning. That is, if you ever get around to doing it. Who wants to stay inside and scrub tubs when the weather’s so nice, anyway? "
OREGON PROTECTS SHARKS,https://vegnews.com/2011/5/oregon-protects-sharks,"MAY 2, 2011","The Oregon House of Representatives has passed a bill that will prohibit people from selling, trading, distributing, and even possessing shark fins. “This unanimous vote… sends a strong message that Oregon will not tolerate the cruel and wasteful practices of shark finning,” says Scott Beckstead, senior director for the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in Oregon. According to HSUS, more than 73 million sharks are killed each year due to people harvesting shark fins for food; the practice usually involves slicing off a shark’s fin and throwing the animal back into the ocean where it bleeds or suffocates to death. Should this bill pass the state’s Senate, Oregon will join Hawaii in being the second state to ban shark finning. "

VEGAN 101: SOCIAL SITUATIONS,https://vegnews.com/2011/5/vegan-101-social-situations,"MAY 1, 2011","How do you deal with being vegan in day-to-day life? Here are some tips for handling social situations from talking to non-vegans about veganism to finding great veg role models. Letting People Know What’s Up
Deciding to go vegan is an excellent first step toward a compassionate lifestyle, but let’s not forget the second, and just as important, step: Coming out as vegan to friends, family, and the world. Keeping a secret like that is hard when eating food is a more than a daily occurrence. If your loved ones are already veg, then great—it’s time for celebration! But most likely, those close to you are also close to their meat, and letting them know you’re cutting out all animal products from your diet and life can be like extraditing yourself from them. Approach the topic with a positive attitude (see below for tips on manners), and it will likely be reflected back at you. Mind Your Manners
Being a polite vegan can be tough when people are eating meat in front of you or believe bacon is their right. Remember that you’re vegan/vegetarian for so many great reasons, but also keep in mind that others might not share the same opinions, or might not have the same background. Being able to recognize that people can make their own choices will make eating with your non-veg friends a more pleasant experience. Instead of force feeding them condescending lines like, “You’re killing the environment, your health, and sentient beings by eating meat!,” try offering suggestions and interesting, though not stifling facts, like “Did you know that eating a more vegetarian-based diet might lower your chances of heart disease and diabetes?” Veganism is all about compassion, and being compassionate to those who have not yet embraced the lifestyle is key. Handling Restaurant Woes
When you’re not dining at an all-vegan establishment, ordering vegan food can be more complicated than solving a calculus problem (especially if you’re a math wiz). First off, assume that the wait-staff does not fully understand what vegan is, and have a condensed explanation ready at hand. “No animals and nothing that comes from them, including milk, butter, and eggs,” is a good starter. Make sure to read the menu carefully as well. That pasta with marinara sauce? It might come with shavings of parmesan on top. When it comes to fried food, always ask what the food is fried in, especially in more mainstream restaurants. Check out all the vegan smart-phone apps that will also help you know what’s OK to get at fast food joints. The popular blog Vegansaurus.com also has a useful (and funny) guide to ordering food. Veg Dating <3
When it comes to vegan dating, there are all sorts of logistics to figure out. How do you pick up a vegan? Do vegans only date other vegans? What are some great date ideas? Are there any veg-specific dating sites? Well, VN has the answers. We’ve compiled our top 10 pick-lines, excellent veg dating sites, and love stories that will have you crying with joy (and jealousy). Need ideas for veg-friendly activities to do with your special someone? Check out our vegan Valentine’s ideas, and make any day one for love. And don’t forget the plant-based aphrodisiacs to spice it up! Activism Now
Take your veganism to the next level by getting active in veg-communities, at your local shelter, or for larger nonprofits such as Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), Mercy for Animals (MFA), People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Compassion Over Killing (COK), and Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM). Not sure where to start? Take a look at our 2011 Activism Resolutions for inspiration. Whether you’re volunteering, hosting a bakesale, or reading up on the latest vegan news, being an active part in the community will help not only those in need, but will have you even more strongly connected to the lifestyle.  Super Vegans
There’s a vegan role model out there for everybody, whether you’re an aspiring chef, animal activist, environmentalist, writer, or other. Notables include Wayne Pacelle, president of HSUS, who now adds “best-selling author” to his list of accomplishments. Isa Chandra Moskowitz, Terry Hope Romero, Tal Ronnen, Hannah Kaminsky, and Robin Robertson are all talented vegan cookbook authors who know how to whip (and write) up a great meal. Need some uplifting words for inspiration? Look no further than those penned by Melisser Elliot, Kris Carr, or Kathy Freston. If you’re searching for vegans who share their lifestyle through more mainstream channels, it’s hard to deny that Ellen DeGeneres, Russell Simmons, Biz Stone, Lisa Bloom, and Alicia Silverstone are some of the most admirable. Search around, because many vegans are worthy of role model status. Go-To Resources
For up to date news on animal-rights work, HSUS, MFA, COK, and PETA all maintain great websites and news channels. Vegan blogs are also a great place to figure out what to prepare for dinner, where to get stylish vegan shoes, or various happenings pertaining to the veg world. A few of our favorites include Ecorazzi, Post Punk Kitchen, and Our Hen House. If you’re looking for events where you can meet other vegans, take a look at our VegEvents guide. VegJobs is also perfect for those in the market for a vegan-friendly career. Want to know even more about the vegan lifestyle? Check out the rest of the VegNews Vegan 101 Series here. "
FLORIDA DOG RACING BILL,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/florida-dog-racing-bill,"APRIL 30, 2011","Members of the Florida House have passed a bill that could potentially end dog racing in the state. Currently, Florida track owners are legally required to hold dog races in order to have other forms of gambling, such as poker, on site. The bill would remove this requirement, and is currently backed by greyhound dog activist groups, such as Grey2K USA and USA Defenders of Greyhounds, and track owners alike. Betting on dog races has decreased by 69 percent in the past 20 years, so it is likely that tracks are likely to discontinue races for business reasons.

VEG-FRIENDLY SOCIAL MEDIA GAMES,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/veg-friendly-social-media-games,"APRIL 26, 2011","As video games become increasingly violent and even a seemingly innocent Facebook game promotes big ag with its goals (FarmVille), it’s difficult to find anything that an eco-conscious vegan can play with comfort. Luckily, the following five games are not only great for entertainment, they’ll also get you to zen out in virtual fields, think more about sustainability, or just slice and shoot items—fruit and tofu!—you’d be comfortable and happy eating. Ecotopia (Facebook): Just launched on Earth Day this year, Ecotopia constructs a social city-building game around sustainability and environmental awareness. The game was developed with support from Conservation International, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping societies responsibly care for nature. Players begin in a dirty, devastated city, with a goal of turning it into a vibrant one through various missions. Not only is the eco-spin on social games new, those who perform real-life acts of sustainability will be rewarded within the game. “Ecotopia creates awareness, engagement, and activism. For the first time, we can fundamentally change the rules on how philanthropic organizations can connect to the 300 million people that play casual games on Facebook each day,” says Larry Bond, chairman of Talkie, the company that created the game. Flower (Playstation): There are no timers, guns, or random enemies to stress out about in Flower; playing this game will give you a more relaxing and meditative experience. Shedding light on the tension between urban bustle and peaceful nature settings, players go into the dreams of flowers living on apartment windowsills. Possibly as nature-friendly as it gets, Flower has been praised by gamers for its beautiful visuals and zen-enhancing music as you cruise through petals and fields. While it may not satisfy the intense game seekers, Flower creates peaceful moments during any hectic day.  Harvest Moon (Various): This game comes in numerous versions including Harvest Moon: Animal Parade and Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility. Each is a farming role-playing game, where you are a small-time farmer planting various produce, attempting to save the town you live in, and in some cases, befriending wild animals. In Animal Parade, in particular, you can have several companion animals, go foraging for wild mushrooms, and even take other characters out on dates or raise a family. With no specific requirements to meet, Harvest Moon games are pleasant retreats to the digital land. Tofu Hunter (Adult Swim Online): Adult Swim has created a satirical version of the standard hunting game, where players shoot down Tofu Bucks and Seitan Birds for points, and cartons of soymilk for extra time. Players are greeted with a humorous message, “This game contains graphic depictions of violence against tofu. We use this not to shock, but to better illustrate pain and suffering innocent tofu goes through every day in the barbaric name of ‘veganism.’” Though it does get bloody, the game provides an entertaining vegan-friendly option. Fruit Ninja (Apple applications): One of the top 10 game apps sold for Apple products, Fruit Ninja is a test of skill and timing. The game trails behind the notable Angry Birds game in the most popular apps, but does not feature launching any animals into buildings. Instead, the goal is to slice as many watermelons, limes, oranges, pineapples, coconuts, strawberries, and special bananas that can either double your score, freeze time and slow fruit speed, or elicit a fruit frenzy. It’s a simple challenge that is guaranteed to have you addicted and playing during work breaks, on the bus, waiting in lines, or any other time you need to make the most of your ninja skills. "
PESTICIDES LINKED TO LOWER IQ,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/pesticides-linked-to-lower-iq,"APRIL 25, 2011","Three separate studies found that pregnant women exposed to pesticides had children with lower IQ scores. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley followed 300 low-income families in California, and found that children with the highest exposure to organophosphates (pesticides used to kill bugs) had an average of seven points lower than those with the least exposure. Similarly, a Columbia University study found that women with higher levels of pesticides in their umbilical-cord blood had children with lower IQ scores and working memory. While organophosphates have been illegal for residential use since 2000, they are still commonly sprayed on farm fields. "

Titled “Bobby’s Bill,” named after a carriage horse who was “retired” into a kill auction, the bill would guarantee that carriage horses live the remainder of their lives at an animal sanctuary or with an individual who signs an assurance that the horse will be kept as a companion animal. Earlier this year, Glee star and vegan Lea Michele called for a boycott of horse-drawn carriages, lamenting the animals’ poor work conditions and long hours. "

"SO FAR IN VEGANISM, 2011",https://vegnews.com/2011/4/so-far-in-veganism-2011,"APRIL 24, 2011","We’ve just surpassed only one quarter of 2011, and already there have been huge strides in the word of veganism. Three New York Times bestsellers? Check. Vegan baked goods conquering the airwaves? Check. A vegan media blitz? Check (times seven). Compiling this list makes us proud of the great steps veganism has taken since New Year’s Day, and has us even more excited for what’s to come. No more puppy mills? Millions more go vegan? Anything’s possible. 1. January saw the rise of Kris Carr’s Crazy Sexy Diet: Eat Your Veggies, Ignite Your Spark, and Live Like You Mean It to number six on The New York Times bestseller list. In February, Kathy Freston’s Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World debuted on the list in the number three spot, and in April, Wayne Pacelle’s The Bond: Our Kinship with Animals, Our Call to Defend Them debuted at 11, ahead of books by Pope Benedict XVI and President George W. Bush. 2. What happens when Oprah devotes an entire episode of her show to veganism? Good things, that’s what. Almost 400 staffers went vegan for a week, and many of them decided to keep going. Now that’s progress. 3. Mercy For Animals released the new documentary Farm to Fridge in February, offering 12 minutes of heart-wrenching slaughterhouse and factory-farm coverage. The organization also began a nationwide film tour to open peoples’ eyes to the horrors of factory farming. 4. As if Oprah weren’t enough, Martha Stewart also devoted an entire episode of The Martha Stewart Show to veganism. From cooking seitan bourguignon with Twitter Co-Founder Biz Stone to talking with Kathy Freston and Farm Sanctuary Co-Founder Gene Baur, the episode exposed the compassionate and delicious vegan lifestyle to even more viewers. 5. Vegan bakeries Sticky Fingers Bakery and C’est La V Bakeshop competed on a March episode of Food Network’s hit show Cupcake Wars, and Sticky Fingers came home with the grand prize. Additionally, Seattle, Wash.-based doughnut shop Mighty-O won the first installment of Food Network Challenge: Donut Champions in April, and Animal Planet recently reported news of their first food-based show, Sweet Avenger, about Vegan Treats owner Danielle Konya. 6. The fashion world is becoming more compassionate in 2011: West Hollywood made plans in January to become America’s first fur-free city, and the launch of Joshua Katcher’s Pinnacle: Reinvent the Icon print campaign during Mercedes Benz-Fashion Week shed light on the animal cruelty evident in the fashion industry. 7. Vogue, Vanity Fair, Glamour, The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time, National Public Radio…it’s not just a list of some of the biggest names in media, it’s also a list of publications that have published articles on veganism this year. From Mark Bittman discussing our relationship with animals to Vogue’s look at veganism for health, these articles push veganism’s path further into mainstream. 8. Steve Wynn, vegan entrepreneur and owner of Wynn Hotels, signed vegan chef Tal Ronnen to his culinary team to revamp vegan menus, providing animal-free food to diners in all 22 of Wynn’s Las Vegas restaurants. 9. Science is backing up even more so what many already know: vegans are healthier. From decreased risk of cataracts, to disease-fighting veggies and muscle-building spinach, more and more studies are showing that a plant-based lifestyle is ideal for optimum health. 10. Political progress, while often thought of as an oxymoron, is happening. From federal and state bills protecting animals, to dietary guidelines and school-lunch standards calling for more produce, to the launch of FoodCorps, those at the top are paying attention to the benefits of a plant-based diet as a solution to the nation’s problems with obesity, climate change, and animal cruelty.

VEGAN 101: HOME & BEAUTY,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/vegan-101-home-andamp-beauty,"APRIL 24, 2011","You may think that veganism is all wool-free sweaters and seitan, but the compassionate lifestyle is larger than just that. The products you put on your body every day can be just as important to your health and the wellness of animals as avoiding Angus beef or shying away from silk. From facial cleansers to carpet cleaners, the items in your home matter, too. Feel like spring-cleaning for the vegan lifestyle might lead to an empty house? Never fear, and read on. Cruelty-Free Cosmetics
Your skin is the largest organ of your body, and just as a pork chop will negatively affect your health, so will a chemical-laced lotion. Since the FDA does not approve the ingredients in skincare and cosmetics (only the color additives), thousands of potentially harmful chemicals go into hair, skin, and makeup products every day. Make sure to always shop for items with all-natural, organic ingredients that do not contain animal products (milk and honey are common offenders), and check the label (or the company’s website) to make sure the product is not tested on animals. Some of our favorite brands include Beauty Without Cruelty, 100% Pure Cosmetics, and Hugo Naturals. For more beauty, hair, and skin care tips, check out the following guides:

No cashmere throws, no sheepskin rugs, and no leather sofas, to start! Many furniture designers are using cruelty-free alternatives to animal skins and hides that will make any living room look chic: Ikea, West Elm, Terra Furnishings, and GREENCulture Furniture offer faux-leather couches, canvas chairs, and more. You can also go cruelty-free while saving money and helping the planet by purchasing already-used or eco-friendly furniture.

Clean, Mean, and Green Vegan Home
While vegan does not necessarily mean “green” or “eco-friendly,” it easily can. By following a vegan diet, you are reducing your carbon footprint dramatically: Why not make the way you live as kind to the planet as possible, too? One easy way to make the change is to switch to green cleaning products. With each spray, you’ll be preventing the release of hundreds of chemicals into the air you breathe. Getting ready to repaint your bedroom? Grab paint without Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC): when released into the air, these compounds combine with others to create ozone, which is bad for the planet and for your health. Greening your office is easy too, with a few simple steps. Check out Green Your Décor for more ideas. With simple swaps and thoughtfulness, you can make your vegan lifestyle reach past the plate and closet. With so many eco- and animal-friendly cosmetics, cleaners, and couches, you can truly live the 100-percent wonderful vegan life. Want to know even more about the vegan lifestyle?

Following nearly 17,000 postmenopausal women in the Women’s Health Initiative, researchers from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, found that taking calcium supplements in conjunction with vitamin D supplements increased heart health risk by 13 to 22 percent. Analysis showed that the risk remained without vitamin D intake. This was not, however, due to increased calcium intake, but rather the sudden change of blood calcium levels after taking supplements, which leads to blood clots or calcification of arteries. "

The island would act as a sanctuary for the species, which is listed as “near threatened” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. While Branson told the BBC that experts said the location would be “an absolutely perfect place where lemurs can be protected and breed,” critics are skeptical. Though the government has already approved Branson’s plan, president of The Conservation Agency James Lazell has expressed worry that the lemurs would have negative effects on the island’s ecology. "

The company will be joining several companies—Kraft Foods, Barilla, Subway, and Unilever, amongst others—in making the switch to use cage-free eggs. “General Mills and the food manufacturing industry are helping the push to move the egg industry from confining hens in cruel and inhumane cages,” says Josh Balk, director of corporate policy for the Humane Society of the United States’ (HSUS) factory farming campaign. According to HSUS, cage-free hens have two to three times more space to move than caged hens. "

SPECIES IN DANGER,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/species-in-danger,"APRIL 19, 2011","Researchers at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) have found that many species of sharks, rays, and fish in the Mediterranean are facing extinction. Loss of habitat, pollution, and “intensive overfishing” has damaged the populations, especially dusky grouper, hake, sea bass, and bluefin tuna. Many of these animals are captured in fishing nets and lines used to capture other fish, which kill the non-targeted species and also destroy the species’ habitats. The study suggests creating new marine reserves, reinforcing regulations on fishing, reducing pollution, and responsible consumption to help conserve the dwindling populations. "

Jon Tester, who introduced the rider with Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, considers it a victory, the change has been met with disappointment from animal-conservation groups such as The Humane Society of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife.

The study looked at 136 samples of red meat and poultry from five US cities and found that 47 percent of the samples contained staph. Perhaps more alarming, however, was that 52 percent of those samples had a form of staph that was resistant to three or more types of antibiotics, a resistance believed to be directly related to antibiotic use in animal agriculture.

PUPPY MILL LAW IN QUESTION,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/puppy-mill-law-in-question,"APRIL 18, 2011","“Missouri’s Puppy Mill Initiative” passed in November last year, but is now being overhauled by lawmakers who claim that it is too costly. The new rules required breeders own no more than 50 breeding dogs, bring the dogs to yearly veterinary examinations, and give them access to both indoors and outdoors. Now, after breeders argued that the law would shut their business down, a bipartisan group has voted to change many of the law’s provisions. “It suggests to me that this is an industry that wants deregulation. They want to do things that they want and to heck with the people who care about dogs,” says President of the Humane Society of the United States Wayne Pacelle of the situation.  "

The Polar Bear program’s website states that, “As a result of measures taken by the Russian Federation, at least 70 bears fewer will be hunted in the United States every year.” The US will continue to allow the hunting of polar bears, “for subsistence purposes,” according to the bilateral agreement made between both countries.

VEGAN 101: FASHION,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/vegan-101-fashion,"APRIL 17, 2011","If vegan clothes strike an image of hemp halter tops and ground-grazing skirts big enough to shelter a family of four beneath them, it’s time to reevaluate. With numerous veg-friendly materials and conscious fashion designers’ threads, there’s absolutely no need to go barefoot or poorly dressed when living the cruelty-free lifestyle. This guide to clothing makes it easy for you to start dressing with compassion. Earth-Friendly Threads
The first step to embracing vegan clothing is realizing that it’s everywhere. That favorite sweatshirt you wear to sleep every night even though it’s pilling at the pits and getting tears in the sleeves? It’s most likely made of cotton, which means it’s vegan. With most T-shirts, sweatshirts, and sweatpants being made of the versatile plant, or a combination blend of it and other veg-friendly materials, being comfy and cruelty-free go hand-in-hand. Other alternatives to wool, leather, and silk include bamboo, PET (made from recycled bottles), soy fabric, nylon, polyester, lyocell, and more. Old Closet Woes
Veteran vegans and those who have just switched to the lifestyle alike wonder what to do with their old leather boots, wool coats, or silk scarves from before they went veg. This is certainly a debatable topic, with people advocating tossing out all of the clothing and accessories that include animal products. Another option is to donate the items to your local Goodwill or Salvation Army. Keeping in mind the message you’re sending with what you wear is most important. Reading Labels
Similar to food, being aware of what’s in your favorite pair of shoes or the biker jacket you’re itching to buy is as simple as reading a label. If it reads “Manmade Material,” then you’re in the clear; if it’s made with leather or fur, put it back on the rack. Silk and wool blends often find their way into cardigans, sweaters, scarves, and several cold-weather accessories, so always make sure to read the entire label, not just the first material. Also look out for cashmere, which comes from the cashmere goat and others, and angora, a kind of wool made from the angora rabbit’s fur. Swap it Up
If you’re low on clothes and on a budget, clothing swaps with friends, co-workers, or even some stylish strangers is a fun and easy way to change up your closet. That girl at work who always shows up in the cutest skirts and cardigans? Invite her! Editorial Assistant Anna Peraino sums up the process best in her Savvy Vegan post on hosting a clothing swap. Happy Feet
Shoes seem to be the hardest cruelty-free wears to find in mainstream stores and outlets where leather and suede are standard materials. Luckily for vegans, there are several places that only offer fashionable flats, boots, running shoes, and more that fit the animal products-free bill, including MooShoes, Vegan Chic, Nice Shoes, Olsenhaus, and Beyond Skin. Several mainstream brands also make specifically vegan lines. Check out TOMS Shoes, Simple Shoes, Keep, and Saucony. Online shoe emporium Zappos even has an entire section dedicated to vegan-friendly shoes. Where to Buy
From Target to Stella McCartney, clothing manufacturers and fashion designers make it easy to find great-looking veg-friendly clothing (sometimes accidentally). Vaute Couture offers beautifully made coats and jackets to keep you warm during winter months and Alternative Outfitters carries everything from handbags to graphic tees. Matt & Nat and Susan Nichole have you covered when it comes to carrying around all your daily necessities. For those on a budget, however, scoping out veg-friendly fashion items is as easy as popping into a (gently) used clothing store such as Buffalo Exchange or Crossroads Trading Co., and remembering to read labels!

10 TIPS FOR GOING GREEN,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/10-tips-for-going-green,"APRIL 17, 2011","While it’s practically impossible to have no carbon footprint, it’s easy to apply some simple changes for a greener lifestyle. Here are our top 10 tips to make Captain Planet proud. 1. Ditch Your Ride. If you’re still in the driver’s seat of an engine-powered vehicle, get out. Unless, of course, that vehicle is a bus and you are transporting more than 20 happy people from place to place. One of the easiest and best ways to cut down on your carbon footprint and contribute to a greener environment is to use alternative transportation. Bikes, buses, subways, and your feet, graced with the ability to move your body from point A to point B, are some excellent options. If you must drive, find an eco-friendly car—VN Publisher Joseph Connelly owns a Toyota Prius—and use it minimally. 2. Get Unplugged. Even when they’re turned off, electronics that are plugged in use standby power of up to 20 watts in one day. While this may not be a lot for a single microwave or TV, it adds up quickly. By keeping everything unplugged until you’re actually using it, you’ll not only be adding to your green points, you’ll be saving money on your electricity bill. 3. RRR&C. This stands for reduce, reuse, recycle, and compost! With the average American creating more than four pounds of waste per day, most already know that the three R’s are standard ways to contribute to a healthier planet. But reducing the waste that goes into landfills doesn’t stop there. While not required by law in most places, composting is an easy way to reuse everything from banana peels to soiled take-out boxes. Not sure about what waste goes where? Check out our guide to recycling and composting. 4. Air and Sun Dry. And ditch your dryer. Spring is here, summer is just around the bend, and the sun’s natural heat is ready to do its work. Dryers are typically one of the highest energy-using appliances in a household, along with refrigerators and water heaters, and cost an average of $85 per year to run. Set up some drying lines in the backyard or on the porch (if you’re not shy about passersby getting a glimpse of your delicates), and leave your clothes to nature’s wonders.  5. Use Less Water. Whether it’s showering for shorter amounts of time, watering your plants less frequently, or washing your clothes on a more as-necessary basis and in larger loads, saving water is key. VN Editor-at-Large Laura Beck says she avoids showering as much as possible. Who needs to be clean when you can be green? Just kidding! But since the average American uses 80 to 100 gallons of water each day, little things like turning the faucet off tightly or using as few dishes as possible (so you won’t have to wash as many later) will make a difference. 6. Eat Your Veggies. As vegans, we are already making a huge step toward helping the environment. The United Nations has already acknowledged that eating less meat and animal products will have a positive impact on the climate. Currently, the livestock industry produces more than 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, uses more than 8 percent of total water consumption, and is a major cause of deforestation and lack of biodiversity. 7. Be Vintage & Crafty. VN Associate Publisher Colleen Holland says she purchases used furniture whenever she can. Now that there are resources such as Craigslist connecting people, it’s even easier to find a coffee table with that perfectly distressed look (and it’s probably more authentic than the ones at Pottery Barn too). 8. Clean Cleaning. According to EPA estimates, indoor air pollution can be as much as 100 times higher than outdoor air, oftentimes due to toxic cleaning supplies. Non-chemical cleaning options such as lemons, vinegar, and baking soda are probably already long-time residents of your pantry, and will keep your home smelling and looking great, minus the dangerous environmental and health impacts. 9. Buy Organic. More than 700 million pounds of agricultural pesticides are used annually in the US, contributing to various environmental problems, from global warming to run-off into water sources, as well as human and animal health concerns. Buying organic foods is one way to take yourself out of the equation. 10. Lastly, Stay Informed. The debates of whether plastic or paper is actually more eco-friendly might go on forever, so changing those habits might be less productive than others. If there’s a new way to reduce water usage or someone finally creates affordable solar panels, then being in the know is important to staying green. "
BOSTON BANS SUGARY DRINKS,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/boston-bans-sugary-drinks,"APRIL 16, 2011","Boston Mayor Tom Menino has banned sugary drinks in Boston proper, affecting concession stands, vending machines, and cafeterias, as well as events where city dollars are used to purchase food and beverages. The executive order also organizes drinks into three categories: red (banned beverages such as non-diet sodas and energy drinks), yellow (beverages that should only be consumed occasionally, including diet sodas and sweetened soymilk), and green (those that can still be sold, such as bottled water and unsweetened soymilk). The hope is that the beverage ban will help the citizens of Boston make easier, healthier beverage choices. "
KUCINICH ON DAILY SHOW,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/kucinich-on-daily-show,"APRIL 15, 2011","Earlier this week, viewers of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show with Jon Stewart witnessed a comedic look into the success of Representative Dennis Kucinich, a vegan, liberal politician who has been elected seven times to a blue-collar district of Ohio. Daily Show reporter John Oliver sat down with the congressman himself to discuss his “improbable success,” his desire to establish the Department of Peace, and even got to see a bit of Kucinich’s ventriloquist act. While an imminent restructuring of the Ohio congressional districts might rid Kucinich of his longtime seat in the House of Representatives, the “unstoppable,” “super-human” politician (as Oliver described) will continue to run for political office.

Backed by senators of both parties, the bill would phase out invasive testing and research on around 1,000 chimpanzees and retire around 500 currently in US laboratories. “The [bill] is a common-sense reform to end the needless pain of psychological harm to one of the animal kingdom’s most highly developed animals,” says Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.). Currently, 80 to 90 percent of chimpanzees in US laboratories are not even used in research, but simply warehoused at taxpayers’ expense; nearly $30 million could be saved each year by passing this act.

Currently set up across from one of New Zealand’s largest egg producers, Scott is bringing awareness to the issue by talking to passersby and through a frequently updated Facebook page. “I am OK, but it is really starting to sink in how long a month actually is. It must be so hard for the birds to have to live there 24/7 for up to 18 months!” Scott writes. "

VEGAN 101: FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/vegan-101-food,"APRIL 10, 2011","Whether you’re curious about the vegan lifestyle or have been vegan for years, this handy guide to vegan food will answer questions, share VegNews editor picks, and give you the 411 on faux meats, vegan beer, and more. The Protein Question
“Where do you get your protein?” is easily the most common question vegans are asked. Protein naturally occurs in hundreds of plant-based foods, such as beans, nuts, and grains. Two tablespoons of peanut butter, for example, has eight grams of protein; one cup of cooked lentils provides 18. According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of protein for the average American man and woman are 56 grams and 46 grams, respectively; on average, Americans eat almost twice those amounts. Vital Vitamins
Like any person, vegans need to ensure they receive proper nutrition. Vitamin B12 is found in microorganisms that live in soil. When animals eat plants, they consume some soil particles, but since we wash our vegetables, we have to find our B12 in other forms. For adults, the RDA of B12 is about 2.4 micrograms, which is most easily achieved by taking supplements, though it can also be found in fortified non-dairy milks, cereals, and other products. Vegans also need to be careful to get omega-3s, essential fatty acids that have been shown to reduce coronary heart disease. Omnivores get their omega-3s from fish, but where do the fish get it? Algae! There are lots of algae-filled omega-3 supplements; you can also get your recommended daily dose (one gram, to be precise) from nuts, seeds, and flax. Making the Change
People think of the switch to veganism as a drastic, I’ll-never-eat-ice-cream again life change, but it doesn’t have to be. Everything from cream cheese to Parmesan has been tastily veganized, and is available in your grocery store (if not, check out online shops Vegan Essentials and Cosmo’s Vegan Shoppe). Some VN favorites for meaty mainstays are Gardein scallopini and beefless tips, Tofurky slices, and Field Roast sausages; for our pizzas we love using Daiya cheese; Follow Your Heart’s Veganaise is great on sandwiches; Coconut Bliss and So Delicious make tasty ice cream—the list goes on and on. When grocery shopping, vegans need to be careful to read labels. Look to the bottom of the ingredients section for the bolded text “Allergy Information” or “Contains.” If the product contains dairy, put it back on the shelf. Other non-vegan ingredients to look out for (aside from the obvious milk, butter, eggs, and honey) are casein (a milk protein), rennet (mammalian stomach enzymes used in the production of cheese), carmine (a dye made from insect scales), and whey (a milk by-product). These guides will help you convert your comestibles:

Meat substitutes have come a long way in the past 20 years, and today vegans can enjoy everything from fried chicken to barbeque ribs. Tofu, which is pressed soybean curd, comes in firm forms great for grilling and baking, soft ones perfect for smoothies, and many others. Tempeh, a cousin of tofu, is another meat stand-in. Made from fermented soybeans, tempeh has a strong flavor and is good for savory dishes. Seitan, or wheat gluten, has a chewy, meaty texture and works well in sandwiches. Resource Round Up
Hundreds of blogs, cookbooks, and websites are filled with vegan recipes and tips to help you in the kitchen. Some of our favorite recipes come from The Conscious Cook, 1,000 Vegan Recipes, The Candle Cafe Cookbook, and The Joy of Vegan Baking. Some sites we love are The Post Punk Kitchen, The Vegan Stoner, Vegansaurus, BitterSweet Blog, Manifest Vegan, VegWeb, and Global Vegan Kitchen. Dining Out
With veganism’s popularity on the rise, more and more restaurants have added veg dishes to their menus, making dining out for vegans as exciting and tasty as it is for omnivores. Be respectful of the wait staff when asking for food without animal products, as most will happily prepare you a cruelty-free meal. Calling ahead to be sure the kitchen can tastily accommodate your needs is always a great strategy, too. Check out more dining-out tips:

FOOD ADDICTION AFFECTS BRAIN,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/food-addiction-affects-brain,"APRIL 7, 2011","Researchers at Yale University have found that brain activity for those with food obsessions is similar to people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol, mainly increased brain activity in the reward pathways. The experiment included 48 women who ranged in weight. An image of either a chocolate milkshake or a glass of water was shown to each woman, and then each woman was given a small sample of what they were shown. Body mass index had no correlation to food addiction, and the anticipation of food produced more brain responses than actually consuming the food. Researchers hope this and further study will help in understanding obesity, which affects almost one-third of Americans. "

NEW MEAT INSPECTIONS,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/new-meat-inspections,"APRIL 6, 2011","In order to reduce the threat of foodborne illnesses, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has proposed a “test and hold” system for the US meat and poultry industries, as current policies do not require that meat pass inspection before being shipped to consumers. Under the new system, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) will hold products back from shipment to consumers until test results for pathogens or drug residues are received. “This approach will help us enhance protection of the food supply, reduce recalls, and ensure that all consumers are getting the safest food possible,” says Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. The change will impact smaller processors, as the five largest processors in the US (90 percent of the nation’s meat supply) already utilize similar safety systems. "

NUCLEAR ENERGY: GOOD OR BAD?,https://vegnews.com/2011/4/nuclear-energy-good-or-bad,"APRIL 3, 2011","Thought of as both a miracle of science and a doomsday wish, nuclear energy has become a widely used and widely contested source of electricity worldwide. Currently in the spotlight due to the near-meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Power Station as a result of the devastating earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, nuclear energy has come to the forefront of political, technological, and public-safety discussions. Here is a guide to the history, technology, and debate behind nuclear power. Nuclear Power 101
Roughly 14 percent of the world’s electricity is generated from nuclear power, more than half of which is generated in the United States, Japan, and France. Nuclear fission occurs when a radioactive substance, usually uranium or plutonium, absorbs a neutron. Fission splits the atom into smaller nuclei and releases radiation, free neutrons, and heat. Some of those free neutrons are then absorbed by other atoms, creating a chain reaction. At today’s nuclear power plants, these chain reactions are controlled inside of a nuclear reactor that is surrounded by water. The water, which becomes extremely hot as a result of fission, produces steam, which then spins turbines that create energy. As it Stands
The United States currently has 104 operating nuclear reactors that provide about 20 percent of the country’s electricity. Proponents maintain that nuclear energy is a renewable energy source that has low carbon dioxide emissions and, for the US particularly, benefits national security by decreasing dependence on foreign countries for energy. The Obama administration is supportive of nuclear power both as a clean-energy source and as a way to decrease American dependence on foreign oil. In a speech on March 30, President Obama said, “It’s important to recognize that nuclear energy doesn’t emit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. So those of us who are concerned about climate change, we’ve got to recognize that nuclear power, if it’s safe, can make a significant contribution to the climate change question.” He went on to state the need to learn from the events in Japan, but that “we can’t simply take it off the table.” Critics, however, cite radioactive nuclear waste, nuclear radiation, nuclear-weapons technology and development, and nuclear accidents as reasons to reduce or diminish the production of nuclear power. Greenpeace, an opponent of nuclear power, also notes, “For years nuclear plants have been leaking radioactive waste from underground pipes and radioactive waste pools into the ground water at sites across the nation.” Radiation can even taint food supplies—in the wake of the disaster at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi Power Station, radiation has been found in milk, spinach, and other produce, and the FDA has banned all milk, vegetable, and fruit imports from Japan in response to public fears. Room for Error
In response to the catastrophe in Japan, millions of Americans looked to their own shores and questioned the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a two-step review of the US’ 104 nuclear power plants, conducting both short- and long-term analyses, with the first update slated for mid-April. A review by ABC News, however, says that in the last four years, 56 safety violations have been found at US nuclear power plants, including deteriorating cooling pipes and defective backup power generators. Still, the NRC insists that all of America’s reactors operate “at world-class safety levels.” What began with the discovery of the neutron in 1932, nuclear energy has caused death and destruction to both people and the planet, but supporters believe it can still be used safely and responsibly as a source of clean, renewable energy.

THE RISING COST OF FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/the-rising-cost-of-food,"MARCH 27, 2011","Bad weather, rising oil prices, and demographic shifts are causing food prices worldwide to skyrocket, inciting protests, violence, and hunger in nations across the globe. Food prices have reached their highest levels since the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization began calculating its food price index in 1990; in the United States, food prices made their largest gain since November of 1974 this past month. Here’s a more in-depth look at what is causing the price hikes and how long these prices will stay. A Perfect Storm
The rise in global food prices is not a simple case of supply and demand, though much of it can be explained that way. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US demand for both corn and wheat are currently exceeding the supplies of the crop, thereby pushing prices higher. Additionally, as China and India, the two most populous countries in the world, become more affluent, so do their dietary choices. Meat consumption in China, for example, has risen a whopping 91 percent from a decade ago. This demand has single-handedly driven up the price of soybeans used in animal feed, and today almost 80 percent of all of the corn grown in the US goes to feed livestock worldwide. But what happened to the supply? Firstly, a heap of poor weather events has contributed to lower crop yields: a poor winter-wheat crop in China, floods in Australia, a drought in Russia, and a cool summer in Iowa have all resulted in smaller harvests. Moreover, as crude oil prices rise due to instability in oil-producing countries, food prices shoot up as well. The reason is two-fold: as crude oil becomes more expensive, crop-based biodiesel and ethanol become a more attractive alternative, thereby increasing demand for corn. At the same time, the fuel (both oil and biofuels) needed to grow, harvest, and transport food worldwide will drive the price of the food itself higher. Cause and Effect
Rising food prices might not mean much to the American consumer and those in developed nations—a 10-cent increase for a pound of spinach won’t necessarily break the bank. It does, however, mean much more for developing nations. The average American household spends about nine percent of its income on food, compared to a staggering 50 percent for households in emerging nations. According to the World Bank, the recent food-price hikes will cause more than 44 million people to fall into extreme poverty. To make matters worse, demand is going to keep rising. A recent UN report estimated that by 2050, world food production will have to jump a whopping 70 percent to feed the estimated world population of 9 billion. Production of major crops will have to jump even more, as the demand for both meat and biofuels rises over the next four decades. What’s Next
While late-winter precipitation in China has led to a better than expected wheat crop and US growers are already making plans to bump up their planting plans, uncertainty plagues growers, manufacturers, and mouths from Mexico City to Melbourne. While some believe that investments in agriculture, using genetically modified crops engineered to produce higher yields, or reducing biofuel use are solutions, others suggest eating less meat and dumping industrial agriculture for more sustainable methods to help alleviate food-supply woes. For example, a recent UN study found that small-scale, sustainable farming could double food production in developing nations. Still, most experts say we should get used to higher prices. According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) research department staff Thomas Helbling and Shaun Roache, “The main reasons for rising demand for food reflect structural changes in the global economy that will not be reversed.” They continue, “Policymakers—particularly in emerging and developing economies—will likely have to continue confronting the challenges posed by food prices that are both higher and more volatile than the world has been used to.” "
MORE VEG DISHES,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/more-veg-dishes,"MARCH 26, 2011","This spring, vegans will have more options to choose from when dining out at many large chain restaurants. Popular chains such as Moe’s Southwest Grill and Hard Rock Café are adding veg options to their springtime menus, as more and more people participate in Meatless Mondays and the popularity of the plant-based lifestyle continues to rise. Paul Damico, president of Moe’s Southwest Grill, says, “We are seeing people choose one day a week to be a ‘flexitarian,’ or to try options other than a meat protein.” The Atlanta-based restaurant chain’s newly introduced rice bowls generate five percent of sales.

Since factory farming is responsible for the vast majority of meat production, Philpott concludes that “vegans and omnivores agree on 99 percent of the meat issue,” saying it’s time to “put aside the other one percent—for now—roll up our sleeves, and clasp hands.” Philpott has created Twitter hashtag #VOAAF for those who wish to show support online.

FIREFIGHTERS LEARN ANIMAL CPR,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/firefighters-learn-animal-cpr,"MARCH 22, 2011","In Ashland, Ore., firefighters are now equipped to give first aid to companion animals affected by smoke. Trained by veterinarian Dr. Alice Sievers, firefighters learned various first-aid techniques including placing small animals entirely inside an oxygen mask and doing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on dogs, cats, gerbils, and reptiles who have inhaled smoke. Sievers advised firefighters to treat the animals as infants, saying that “the numbers are basically the same, there’s just a few anatomical differences. We don’t do mouth-to-mouth, we do mouth-to-snout.” Ashland Fire & Rescue Captain Dana Sallee says this training is particularly helpful, as residents are often most worried about animals left inside the home during a fire.

INSTANT MOOD BOOSTERS,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/instant-mood-boosters,"MARCH 22, 2011","With stressful jobs, a million things on your to-do list, and the constant reality of living vegan in a non-vegan world, it’s only natural to get down in the dumps occasionally. Fortunately, these 10 tips are surefire ways to pull yourself out of any rut in no time. 1. Write it down. It has long been touted that putting inner thoughts on paper can have an immediate effect of release and relief. A bad day at work nagging you? Write about it. Annoyed with your partner? Pen a letter. The simple act of taking your thoughts out of your own head and onto another medium will give you feelings of resolution. 2. Tune out. Studies show that music releases feel-good chemicals in your brain. Next time you’re feeling down, take a five-minute break to listen to your favorite song and blast the blues away. 3. Move your bod. Exercise, whether it’s hard-core strength training or a simple stroll, releases endorphins, otherwise known as happiness chemicals. When your mood drops, take a brisk walk. You’ll feel better than before. 4. Hang with Fido. Simply petting a dog or cat has been shown to lower blood pressure and calm nerves. If a stressful day has you frazzled, give your pup some special attention—it will make both of you happy. Not a companion-animal guardian? Try volunteering at your local shelter or simply pet the next pooch you see. 5. Make plans. Having something to look forward to can raise spirits. Call a friend you need to catch up with and invite her to dinner. You’ll get the added benefit of spending time with someone you like—another way to feel better fast. 6. Take a breather. Used for centuries as a relaxation technique, meditation has been shown to ward off depressive thoughts and anxiety. Try taking in slow, deep breaths for five minutes and see where it takes you. 7. Laugh. Laugher releases endorphins, improving your mood instantly. When you’re feeling blue, go talk to that funny co-worker, watch your favorite comedy, or check out websites like Funny or Die, filled with short videos sure to release some giggles and guffaws. 8. Engage your senses. Most of the time, we use some senses (like sight and hearing) more than others. To give yourself a break, grab a lemon. Researchers found that linalool, a chemical found in lemons, may reduce stress responses in the brain. Sniff lavender and mint to get similar benefits. 9. Get organized. Cluttered desks and drawers can distract you, making you less productive and fouling your mood. Organizing your environment will clear your head as well as your workspace. You don’t have to clean out your closet to get these effects, however—simply organizing a drawer will boost your productivity and spirits. 10. Go outside. Sunshine is a proven mood lifter, and helps to increase serotonin, an important mood-boosting chemical that also assists in sleep. In addition, sunlight provides the vitamin D necessary for the body’s absorption of calcium. Take a 10 to 20 minute walk on a sunny day to max out the sun’s benefits. "
FELONY CRUELTY IN NEVADA,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/felony-cruelty-in-nevada,"MARCH 22, 2011","Introduced earlier this month, a new bill in the Nevada state legislature seeks to make animal cruelty a felony offense. Nevada is currently one of the few states left that does not consider animal cruelty a felony on the first offense; the new bill would charge first offenders with either a class C or D felony. Additionally, the bill calls for misdemeanor charges to be placed on anyone who removes a dog or cat from its mother before the animal is eight weeks old. The bill has been nicknamed “Cooney’s Law,” after a rescue dog who was tortured to death with a box cutter. "
VEG-FRIENDLY BALLPARKS,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/veg-friendly-ballparks,"MARCH 22, 2011"," Prince Fielder, this year’s winner of the Home Run Derby, proves that animal protein isn’t required to knock one out of the park. If you don’t need meat to hit a home run, you certainly don’t need it to watch a home run—with all the veggie dog options available today, you’re sure to find one to tantalize your taste buds. But are these soy-based savories available at your favorite baseball stadium? You can bet your season tickets they are, and they’ll make those crummy nosebleed seats a bit more palatable. Grab that faded baseball cap and sample these eats at the next game. Bleacher-Seat Eats
Starting with the West Coast, AT&T Park, home base for the San Francisco Giants, has veggie dogs at three vending locations—this means less running around and more time spent in the bleachers, willing that fly ball to meteor down into your open glove. Portabello mushroom sandwiches, Macho Nachos with beans and grilled veggies, veg pot stickers, and vegetable sushi rolls will sustain you through any extra innings. Or, for an extra-big bite, head to Dodger Stadium for a Lightlife Jumbo Dog, sold at four different concession stands. Add some Mediterranean flare with a side of veggies and a heaping helping of hummus. Team veg reigns supreme on the East Coast as well. Citi Field, where the New York Mets reside, has a dream lineup of veg dogs and burgers as well as vegetable rolls and edamame. Two different Subway locations also offer veggie subs. Though, the biggest, baddest vegan smorgasbord has to be at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies. We’re talking flame-grilled Gardenburgers, Lightlife Smart Dogs, and—wait for it—crab-free crab cakes and veggie cheesesteaks. Ditch the bun on these last two treats for dairy-free deliciousness. Stadium Staples
Of course, several traditional stadium sips and snacks fall into the I-can’t-believe-it’s-vegan category. Cracker Jacks, for example, won’t surprise you with animal ingredients, and pretzels and peanuts are always in steady supply. Brew go-to’s such as Miller Genuine Draft and Bud Lite are good to guzzle and won’t compromise your ethics. Get in the Game The odds are favorable that meat-free fare is available at any stadium you choose, just be sure to check SoyHappy.org to see if your chosen chow is vegan. If cruelty-free grub isn’t available, muster up some courage, contact the stadium, and politely inform them of all the business they’re missing—there is more profit to be made and vegan bellies to fill. It’s like feeding two birds with one hand, people. Johanna McCloy-founder of Soy Happy, a group that works to get veg options into baseball stadiums—advises veggie ambassadors to be persistent: “The Mets are a perfect example for this season. It took a year of persistent calls and e-mails and ongoing effort before they added veggie dogs to their new stadium’s menu. And they added them all over the stadium, too.” "
HARPER’S VEGAN SUPPLEMENTS,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/harpers-vegan-supplements,"MARCH 21, 2011","Vegan, Biggest Loser trainer, and VegNews cover star Bob Harper announced that he has created a line of 100-percent vegan nutritional supplements. Called Bob Harper’s Smart Success, the product line includes a weight-loss starter kit, a weight-loss formula, and a seven-day cleanse, and will be made of vegan, gluten-free ingredients such as pomegranate and goji berry. “I wanted to help create a supplement line that, with diet and exercise at the forefront, will give people that extra boost,” Harper says. The line will be available in stores this April. "
JAPAN’S TAINTED FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/japans-tainted-food,"MARCH 21, 2011","The Japanese government has found that the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station has affected the island nation’s food supply. Officials have reported higher than normal levels of radioactive iodine in milk and spinach. The levels found in the milk and spinach were five and seven times the norm, respectively. Still, Yukio Edano, the country’s chief cabinet secretary, says the levels “do not pose an immediate [health] threat.” According to Dr. David J. Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University, about 98 percent of exposure to radioactive iodine comes from dairy products. "
FIRST VEGAN BLOG ZINE,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/first-vegan-blog-zine,"MARCH 21, 2011","Vegan Mainstream has launched Vstream Zine: A Vegan Blog Reporter, a 54-page zine all about vegan blogs. The publication compiles blog recommendations and preferences from influential vegans around the world. According to Vegan Mainstream, the zine “will equip a novice or expert with new insights to some of the funniest, strangest, and most awesome blogs the vegan community has to offer.” Also included are articles about using social media platforms, a directory of 200 vegan blogs, interviews with bloggers about how they started and why they think blogging is important to the veg community, and more.

FUR LABELING TRUTH,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/fur-labeling-truth,"MARCH 20, 2011","The Truth in Fur Labeling Act just went into effect, officially closing the loophole that clothing for less than $150 does not need labeling. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) has been conducting investigations on retailers for several years and found that fur from domestic dogs, wolves, and raccoon dogs is commonly left unlabeled. Aimed at to protect consumers from unknowingly supporting the fur industry, the act will be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. Companies that do not correctly label fur clothing will be fined of up to $5,000. "
BAN ON ANIMAL FILMING,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/ban-on-animal-filming,"MARCH 20, 2011","In a move similar to Florida’s lawmakers’ earlier this month, Iowa’s agriculture committees have pushed a bill into the House and Senate that would make undercover recordings of the industry illegal. People who take agriculture jobs only to gain access for recording, in a similar manner as Mercy For Animal’s recent Farm to Fridge film, would be punished with up to five years of prison and $7,500 in fines. “What’s needed is reform of these factory farms that will prevent cruelty to animals. What’s not needed its to make factory farming cruelties more secretive,” comments Paul Shapiro, a senior director at the Humane Society of the United States. "
VEG GENDER DISCRIMINATION,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/veg-gender-discrimination,"MARCH 20, 2011","In his newly published paper, Arizona State law professor Zachary A. Kramer argues that an employee fired because he is vegetarian constitutes sex discrimination. Ryan Pacifico was fired from his position as a currency trader in New York City after being consistently harassed for being vegetarian by his boss, Robert Catalanello. Catalanello put Pacifico down for his veg diet using anti-gay slurs, although Pacifico is straight, and ridiculed his athleticism. Regarded as “unmanly” by Catalanello, Kramer states that Pacifico’s vegetarianism was directly related to gender-stereotyping, and thus qualifies Pacifico to sue under the sex discrimination law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. "
Q&A WITH VEGAN CHOREOGRAPHER CYNTHIA KING,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/qandampa-with-vegan-choreographer-cynthia-king,"MARCH 20, 2011","Vegans love to multitask (planning the ultimate veg weekend while baking perfect chocolate-chip cookies? No problem.), but a few of us are really, truly multitalented, as evidenced by dancer, choreographer, and instructor Cynthia King. The Brooklyn-based performer founded Cynthia King Dance Studio, where children and adults come to learn everything from the five positions of ballet to popping and locking. King is also the creator of the only readily available vegan ballet shoe line in the country, with celebrities such as Natalie Portman and Emily Deschanel on her client list. VegNews caught up with King for insight into her busy, creative world. VegNews: How were you introduced to veganism and what made you commit to the lifestyle?
Cynthia King: I became aware that the meat on my plate was the flesh of animals in 1967—I was 10. It changed my life forever. At first I became vegetarian and then vegan once I learned that there was nothing humane about any use of animal products as part of my lifestyle. A lot of it was through reading literature and a lot of it was common sense.  VN: You recently choreographed “Dinner and Other Dances,” which benefitted Farm Sanctuary. Do you often choreograph dances that shed light on animal welfare?
CK: Like many choreographers, I am intrigued by the way animals move. I have made dances inspired by birds, snakes, giraffes, piglets, and butterflies. Lately, I have experimented with pieces that include children and adults with animal welfare themes. I choreographed a piece called “Exposé” in which dancers were crowded into a cage on stage. The piece is about the agony animals exploited for entertainment endure. It was amazing how the children expressed the theme in a raw, spontaneous way. During rehearsals I spoke with the children about the ways that animals are made to do the things they do in performances. It is important for me to be able to create and stage purely abstract pieces as well as pieces that include animal themes. VN: Having an entirely vegan studio, what kind of reaction do you get from students and guests? 
CK: Students and their families embrace the cruelty-free environment. They also learn about the health benefits of plant-based eating, since we offer vegan literature and always serve great vegan food at our events—even at parent orientation meetings. People come here for excellent dance training, and few are vegan, most are caring and open. A parent of a dancer recently told me that her daughter loved animals and asked me for suggestions on where to get cruelty-free makeup for her child. That warmed my heart! VN: What was the process like when creating your vegan ballet slippers? Are you hoping to expand and offer more types of vegan dance shoes?
CK: The process was challenging because I had no experience at all in this kind of project. It was completely trial and error. The vegan shoes I had been using had stopped being made (they were also from overseas and very expensive). Students were always asking me what shoes I recommended and there was no shoe I could recommend in good conscience, since none were vegan. In 2002, I started searching for a textile that would work. I approached a dance shoemaker with the materials and asked him if he would try to make a shoe for me. He said yes, and now the current shoe beautifully balances form and function, transitioning perfectly from the studio to the stage. We’re hoping to offer the shoes in more mainstream outlets, and I’m always open to filling voids in the dance-shoe market. VN: What’s been the most exciting part of your journey as a vegan dancer, choreographer, and dance instructor?
CK: Being able to be active in two areas I am passionate about: animal rights and dance; seeing my students grow into seasoned, confident dancers and into mature, compassionate young women and men; and introducing the only prêt-à-porter vegan ballet slippers are all very exciting. VN: What can we expect from Cynthia King Dance Studio in the future?
CK: I’m planning the expansion of my dance company and school for a bigger space and more performances. We’re making a big effort to get the ballet slippers into more mainstream retail and media outlets. Our annual spring performances take place at Kumble Theater in Brooklyn April 29 to May 1. All of the students will be wearing all-vegan shoes and costumes. "

PLANTS IMPROVE MOOD,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/plants-improve-mood,"MARCH 19, 2011","Recent research finds that houseplants improve people’s moods as well as provide excellent air purification; not only do they change carbon dixiode into oxygen, they are also able to take toxic chemicals out of the air. While considering plant usage in space bases, NASA specifically found that plants reduce airborne bacteria by 50 to 60 percent. Researchers at Virginia Tech also found that houseplants reduce indoor dust by 20 percent. In addition, plants provide a calming effect, says the US National Gardening Association, and more than one-third of American homes grow plants indoors. "
JAPAN’S FOOD FEARS,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/japans-food-fears,"MARCH 17, 2011","A week after the earthquake and following tsunami, Japan’s main island, Honshu, has been hit by a food shortage. The shortage is due to a combination of hoarding and a broken supply chain, which normally is maintained through now damaged roads, railways, and ports. The country’s agriculture minister has already warned people against hoarding, as it makes it harder to get supplies to the most affected areas. Increased radiation levels from a damaged nuclear power plant has also led to anxiety over food and water contamination. According to Dave Byron of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization, however, there is currently no evidence of food contamination in the country. "
MICHELLE OBAMA’S BOOK,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/michelle-obamas-book,"MARCH 17, 2011","First Lady Michelle Obama has signed with Crown Publishing Group to write a book about healthy food and the White House Garden. Obama says, “We wanted to share the story with the rest of the nation and perhaps with the rest of the world, because we get so many questions about the garden: How did we do it? Why did we do it? How do I do this in my own home or community?” Additionally, the book will include some of the Obamas’ favorite healthy recipes. The currently untitled tome is scheduled to release in April 2012, and all proceeds will go to charity. "
REDUCING FOOD ILLNESS,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/reducing-food-illness,"MARCH 17, 2011","In an effort to reduce foodborne illnesses caused specifically by raw poultry, the US Department of Agriculture has announced new industry standards. Starting July 2011, no more than 7.5 percent of raw chicken can test positive for Salmonella, compared to the previous 20 percent allowance. The USDA estimates that after two years of enforcing the new standards, there will be 20,000 fewer Salmonella infections and about 5,000 less Campylobacter infections. The agency, however, will not have legal authority to shut plants down, but will be posting results on its website. "
ANIMAL RESCUE IN A TSUNAMI-RAVAGED JAPAN,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/animal-rescue-in-a-tsunami-ravaged-japan,"MARCH 17, 2011","Japan’s devastating earthquake, ensuing tsunami, and multitude of aftershocks on March 11 left many people without homes, power, and searching for their loved ones. Its aftermath also left thousands of animals stranded, either separated from their guardians or abandoned. Here are a few animal organizations asking for donations to help continue their efforts to help a nation in the midst of disaster. Search & Rescue
The Search Dog Foundation (SDF) pairs rescued dogs with trained firefighters as a search-and-rescue team for natural disasters. On March 13, 12 SDF dogs and their handlers arrived in Japan, and then traveled to the Ofunato City area on the northeast coast of Japan, searching for survivors. The dogs are trained to give a “bark alert” when finding a possible survivor, and the teams work together extensively before they are deployed. It currently costs SDF $15,000 to train their canine-firefighter teams for important life-saving missions. Humane Help
There are several humane societies that are seeking funds to help those animals in need. Humane Society International and the Humane Society of the United States are deploying staff to Japan as well as connecting with Japanese partner organizations to determine how they can best give emergency support and veterinary attention. World Vets is working with its volunteers, US Army veterinary associates in Japan, and Japanese animal-based charities to gather supplies as first-responder teams prepare to go out and provide aid to injured animals. The World Society for the Protection of Animals is sending members from its Asia office to Japan. American Humane Association assists animal victims of disaster, and you can text “Protect” to 85944 to give a $10 donation. Local Japanese Organizations
Three local animal-rescue organizations (Japan Cat Network, Animal Garden Niigata, and Heart-Tokushima) have banded together to form Japanese Earthquake Animal Rescue and Support to assist with animals that need to be rescued. The newly formed coalition promises to use all donated money and resources for the sole purpose of rescue, care, and support of the cats and dogs in crisis. A local rescue group, Animal Refuge Kansai, is accepting as many animals as possible to care for. Any donations given to them will be used strictly for the homeless animals they take in. For more local rescue groups, click here. Some rescue groups only accept donations in Japanese yen. Here is a conversion calculator. Facebook
For up-to-the-minute updates on all of these organizations and their progress in Japan, connect with these nonprofits via their Facebook pages. The following organizations are on Facebook: Japan Earthquake Animal Rescue and Support, Search Dog Foundation, World Vets, and Heart-Tokushima. By supporting local and national animal-rescue organizations during a time of terrible disaster, injured and abandoned animals will have the care and attention they so desperately need. "
NEW YORK ANTIBIOTICS BILL,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/new-york-antibiotics-bill,"MARCH 16, 2011","A bill to reduce antibiotics used on factory-farm animals will soon start making its way through Congress. Reintroduced by Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA) seeks to limit the use of antibiotics for non-therapeutic use. “When we go to the grocery store to pick up dinner, we should be able to buy our food without worrying that eating it will expose our family to potentially deadly bacteria that will no longer respond to our medical treatments,” Slaughter says. According to the FDA, around 80 percent of the antibiotics used in the US are for farm animals. "
SOY ON THE RISE,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/soy-on-the-rise,"MARCH 16, 2011","Ever since the US Department of Agriculture released its January dietary guidelines, which encouraged eating more soy, food companies have been trying to integrate the ingredient into more products. While soy is a key part of Asian cuisines, Americans mostly consume it unknowingly in sauces, snack foods, and salad dressings. Now, food companies are trying to create more natural soy-based products and are focusing on marketing aimed at overcoming the food’s “ick factor.” Vitasoy has launched Tofu U, an online guide to making meals with bean curd. Major companies including Hain Celestial, Kellog’s, and Dupont are all working on making soy mainstream. "
MARK BITTMAN TALKS ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/mark-bittman-talks-animals,"MARCH 16, 2011","In his new New York Times “Opinionator” column, Mark Bittman analyzes the fine line between companion animals and animals we use for food, questioning how farm animals can be treated in inhumane ways while people can be punished by law for mistreating their companion animals. Additionally, he equates eating excessive amounts of meat to the idea that farm animals don’t feel pain. Bittman writes, “We should be treating animals better and raising fewer of them; this would naturally reduce our consumption. All in all, a better situation for us, the animals, the world.” Bittman is also an advocate for Meatless Mondays and sustainable agriculture. "
FLORIDA FARM ANIMAL BILL,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/florida-farm-animal-bill,"MARCH 15, 2011","Calves raised for veal and hens raised for eggs must be given enough space to turn, lie down, and fully extend their limbs if a newly introduced Florida bill passes. Initiated by Senator Michael S. Bennett, the bill would make Florida the third state to have such protections for calves, hens, and sows. “Florida’s new bill is an important step towards granting farm animals the consideration all animals deserve,” says Gene Baur, president and co-founder of Farm Sanctuary. “We have an ethical obligation to treat them with respect.” Currently, seven states have made at least one form of factory farm confinement "
INDUSTRIAL FARMS UNNECESSARY,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/industrial-farms-unnecessary,"MARCH 15, 2011","The world can be fed without the presence of industrial agriculture, according to a new UN report. The report, Agroecology and the Right to Food, states that within five to 10 years, small-scale farming could double food production where most of the world’s hungry reside by utilizing “agroecology.” This farming method uses the natural environment to enhance soil and resist pests, and has led to crop-yield increases of 80 percent in 57 developing countries. “Conventional farming relies on expensive inputs, fuels climate change, and is not resilient to climatic shocks. It simply is not the best choice anymore today,” says author of the report, Olivier De Schutter. "

CHICKENS SHOW EMPATHY,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/chickens-show-empathy,"MARCH 9, 2011","Researchers from the University of Bristol have found that hens have physical reactions and show empathy when their chicks are in distress. The study found that female chickens exhibited an intense stress response when their chicks, who the hens were separated from but could smell, hear, and see, were exposed to a puff of air which caused mild distress without harm. The hens also emitted a “maternal vocalization” call, telling the chicks to return to them. Researchers believe the findings are important for farming environments, as animals are exposed to the pain and distress of other members of their species. "

DISEASE-FIGHTING VEGGIES,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/disease-fighting-veggies,"MARCH 8, 2011","University of Alabama of Birmingham researchers have discovered how certain vegetables and foods such as broccoli, soybeans, kale, cabbage, green tea, and turmeric reverse or prevent cancer and age-related diseases. Technically termed an “epigenetic diet,” compounds in such foods gradually suppress negative gene expressions that cause diseases such as Alzheimer’s. “The epigenetics diet can be adopted easily, because the concentrations of the compounds needed for a positive effect are readily achievable,” says lead author of the study and assistant research professor Syed Meeran.

VEGAN WINS CUPCAKE WARS,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/vegan-wins-cupcake-wars,"MARCH 8, 2011","First, vegan chef Chloe Coscarelli won Food Network’s Cupcake Wars with her stunning Chocolate Strawberry Shortcake and Crème-filled Chocolate Orange with Candied Orange Peel cupcakes. Now, two more vegan pastry chefs—Doron Petersan from Sticky Fingers Bakery and Kim Garr of C’est La V Bakeshop—have faced off against each other and two mainstream bakers for a Cupcake Wars’ grand prize, $10,000 and the opportunity to showcase their cupcakes at a Food Network event. And the winner? Petersan took home the top prize with her winning vegan cupcakes and shares all the behind-the-scenes of her climb to the top. Garr got her start baking at Leda’s Bakeshop in Los Angeles and convinced the owner to let her whip up a line of vegan treats. The bakeshop closed in late 2008, prompting Garr to open her own bakery in early 2009. Sticky Fingers, hailed as “Best Bakery” three years in row in Washington City Paper’s Best of DC Readers’ Picks, got its humble start in Petersan’s kitchen. After many taste tests, the bakery moved into a tiny basement shop in Washington, DC, and Petersan now runs her vegan cupcake empire from a lovely, center-of-it-all location with a dedicated team who bring sweet treats and tasty eats to the DC-area. VN caught up with these talented ladies moments after the show aired to get the inside scoop on what it takes to bake under fire. VegNews: How did you get on Cupcake Wars?
Doron Petersan: The show’s producers contacted us and asked us to apply. Since we had a bricks-and-mortar store and we sell online, I think that intrigued the show’s producers and gave us a little bit of an edge. When they contacted us, I wanted to do it 100 percent. In our audition video, I’m jumping around in front of the store. Our baker Jenny, my assistant on Cupcake Wars, and I showed off our personalities and lots of pictures of cupcakes.
Kim Garr: A casting assistant from Cupcake Wars called me to audition after seeing my blog. (Take a peek at Kim’s audition video.) VN: What was it like competing on the program?
KG: It was crazy. It’s just as crazy as when you’re watching it. When Chloe was on the show, I remember thinking, “I could never do that. That’s insane.” The competitive nature of the show is not how I normally operate. I’d rather just chat with everyone, especially when I realized Sticky Fingers was part of the competition. But I definitely felt good about being on the show.
DP: Competing was so much fun. It’s serious high energy and I loved every second of it. The clock is huge and ticking right above the tables the entire time. You can see it from everywhere you are like it’s staring down at you, heckling your every move. There is so much chaos from the other teams, to the cameras, to the judges eyeing you. It’s serious! VN: Tell us about the ingredients they offered you and what cupcakes you made.
KG: In the first round, you have to pick two ingredients from the options that they give you. Our episode had a comedy theme to it, so we had ingredients like canned ham and whipped cream. Half of the ingredients weren’t even vegan. The vegan items we could use were bananas, seltzer, kumquats, lima beans, and kiwi. For the first round, I decided on a coconut kiwi cupcake with lemon curd filling with coconut buttercream and fresh kiwi. I knew it would be a huge risk for me to make my own vegan lemon curd, but to me, it was an opportunity to show people that you could make a really good vegan version. I also knew there was a chance this wasn’t going to work in the 45 minutes I was allotted.
DP: We made a chocolate seltzer cake cupcake topped with ganache, banana crème frosting, and caramelized bananas for the first round and named it the Gilbert Ganache-fried.  The second round was 50 percent presentation and 50 percent flavor with the theme being the All-Star Comedy Show After Party at the infamous Ice-House Comedy Club for their 50thAnniversary. We did a ginger cupcake filled with brandy-peach filling, blueberry frosting, and topped it with a talking blueberry including a word bubble made from fondant. This cupcake was named the Blueb Sagget in honor of the working blue comics we love so much. Next, was the signature-drink cupcake for the night—a vanilla cupcake filled with kiwi-curd, topped with strawberry frosting and garnished with a strawberry filled with a shot of rum. Lastly (and our personal favorite) was the star of the evening, the George Caramelin. It was a chocolate cinnamon cupcake, filled with bourbon caramel, topped with bourbon vanilla frosting, more bourbon caramel, candied pecans, and a fondant gold star and the number ‘50’ to signify the 50th anniversary. The idea of naming the cupcakes made us laugh out loud. We decided to stick with it in hopes the judges would get it and giggle too. VN: With the clock ticking, how did you keep calm under pressure?
DP: I didn’t. I was yelling, moving as quickly as possible, dropping stuff. It was a total mess in our kitchen. I had serious adrenaline the entire time.
KG: I don’t know that I totally did! Making a cupcake, filling, and frosting under 45 minutes is not your typical or ideal baking scenario. Honestly, there’s so little time you can’t really think about it. You just have to keep moving. VN: What do you think the perception is now of vegan bakeries post-show?
KG: When Chloe was on the show, it was huge. Now there’s an episode with two vegan bakers. We’re exposing people to the vegan lifestyle. I hope it makes people curious and piques their interest and that it starts changing the way people look at food. If people are curious, now they can try vegan cupcakes just by ordering them.
DP: I think we are getting there and definitely making our mark. It’s not a coincidence that two vegan bakers have won the show. In another episode this season, a non-vegan team included a vegan cupcake in their spread! Even professional bakers are realizing that vegan baking methods can hold their own in the mainstream baking world, which has, up until now, been ruled by eggs and butter. Those aren’t the only two ingredients you can use in baking that taste great, or that give you the results you desire. It’s now two seasons in a row where dairy and eggs took a back seat to healthier and tastier alternatives. And what about creativity? Thinking on the spot and coming up with tasty combos while quick on your feet is nothing new for us vegan bakers. We’ve been doing this for years! VN: Tell us what it was like for you on the show from start to finish. Was it nerve-wracking? Exhilarating? Thrilling?
DP: All of the above! Walking into the room in front of the judges made me weak in the knees. I was smiling so wide my face hurt, and then we started baking. Everything after round one is a blur! I seriously don’t remember much of anything other than the clock and the cupcakes. During round two when Jenny set our peach filling on fire, I shouted, “Put it out before you burn it! There isn’t time to make it again!” You know it’s stressful when your biggest concern in a fire is burning the peaches. Manners go out the window. We were at war to prove that the vegans could win, again. Our bakery is busy. We’ve had some seriously crazy days with more orders than we could keep up with, but this was like nothing I’ve ever experienced. This was my first time making 1,000 cupcakes in less than two hours, designing and building a display, and training four new bakers what you wanted them to do as they were doing it. There was a point where I wanted everyone to stop baking and count to make sure we had enough cupcakes. Jenny had to scream in my face, “just keep going,” to bring me back to reality. It worked. Our years of hard work both testing the recipes and the waters paid off. I’m proud of what we have accomplished but even more excited about where veganism is today. I can only hope that vegan fare gaining acceptance in the culinary, gastronomy, and pastry worlds can mean better things for the animals. VN: How did competing on Cupcake Wars elevate your skills as a baker?
KG: It was a shot in the arm for me. I had to be willing to share my recipes so I had to really work on different flavor combinations. The show got me in the mindset for getting more creative, and now I’m excited to make new flavors for my customers. It also gave me the courage to work on cakes. As a kid, I dropped my dad’s birthday cake—so I had a thing about cakes. After the show, it pushed me to try cakes again.
DP: It upped the game for sure and inspired us to dig into our recipes and get more from them. Really, I think we just saw other baker’s flavors on the show and combos and thought, “I want to eat that.” Hunger is the only motivation we need to come up with new, exciting desserts. Last week Jenny made a ginger coconut cupcake that was insane. I now have a renewed love affair with everything coconut and can’t find enough combos to curb my desire. Being on the show made us take a look at what we do and how, and has given us the confidence to go bigger and better. VN: Any advice for vegan bakers who want to audition for Cupcake Wars?
KG: When you make an audition video, the more you are yourself and let your personality show, the better. I’m not into food coloring, glitter, or decorations. I want my food to look like food, so I use organic, all-natural ingredients. It was important to me that I go on and do what I do, confidently. Do your best. You can feel positive about the fact that you did your own thing. Also, get ready because it is a crazy, but great, learning experience.
DP: Bring everything you have to the table. The competition is fierce and the judging, even more-so. Florian Bellanger and Candace Nelson are the cupcake aficionados. Create flavors to knock their socks off and keep the creativity high to keep them on their toes and wanting more. That is the secret to success on Cupcake Wars. VN: What baking tips do you have for home bakers to make delicious cupcakes like yours?
KG: First of all, don’t be afraid. You’re just using different versions of sugar, fat, flour, and binding ingredients. Let go and just try it. It took me a long time to be comfortable with failure in the kitchen. I’m a real perfectionist so I’d test a recipe and be upset if it didn’t work. I finally got to a point where it’s not a big deal any more. It may take a couple of tries so don’t be hard on yourself. There are so many great cookbooks out there, like Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World. There are plenty of resources for vegan baking.
DP: Work backwards! Decide what you want your end result to be and go from there. Too often the flavors and combinations of ingredients can get tangled together, fighting for your palate. Think about the textures and flavors you want in your sweet-treat. Fluffy and light, go for baking powder and egg replacer as your leveners rather than baking soda and vinegar. Baking soda and vinegar work great with chocolate cake but can overpower your lighter flavors like vanilla and coconut. Learn from our mistakes and use them to your advantage. Using coconut milk or cocoa butter in ganache will result in a smoother product. Soymilk absorbs lots of water and in our case, pulled any and all liquid from our ganache in round one causing it to dry too fast. No one wants sludge-like ganache! Hungry for cupcakes now? Whip up a batch of Doron Petersan’s Chocolate Seltzer Cupcakes or Kim Garr’s delicious Coconut Kiwi Cupcakes. Want more inside scoop on Doron and Kim’s experience on Cupcake Wars?

WATER-POLLUTING DAIRIES,https://vegnews.com/2011/3/water-polluting-dairies,"MARCH 2, 2011","According to a Food & Water Watch report, California’s Central Valley dairy farms are causing high levels of pollution to groundwater systems. Around 900 dairy facilities’ water had nitrate levels higher than drinking water standards, and the majority of the farms are located within 300 feet of a well where local residents get their drinking water. One example includes White River Dairy in Ducor, Calif., which has received six notices for illegally dumping waste into a river that feeds directly to a groundwater source. No violating farms, however, have been fined. California accounts for 21 percent of the nations’ dairy production, with five of the top producers located in the Central Valley. "

SHOULD YOU EAT RAW OR COOKED? WE HAVE THE ANSWER,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/should-you-eat-raw-or-cooked-we-have-the-answer,"FEBRUARY 22, 2011","That good-for-you garden salad might not be delivering on its promises: Many of produce’s health-promoting properties can be lost when baking, sautéing, or grilling. Read on to find how to get everything these nutrient powerhouses have to offer. Carrots, Pumpkins, and Sweet Potatoes
Don’t be afraid to throw these orange edibles in the oven. These vegetables are high in beta-carotene, a carotenoid that is converted into vitamin A in the body, and important for vision, bones, and immunity. Beta-carotene resides in vegetables’ cellular walls—cooking breaks down those walls and makes absorption easier. Studies have also shown that falcarinol, an anti-cancer property found in carrots, increases when cooked. Broccoli, Kale, Collard Greens, Cauliflower, Brussels Sprouts, and Cabbage
Raw is the right way to go with these members of the Brassicaceae family. All of these greens contain sulforaphane and glucosinolate, two cancer-preventative substances. Studies have shown that cooking broccoli reduces its sulforaphane by more than 90 percent, and other studies have found that up to 77 percent of glucosinolates are lost when boiling these vegetables for 30 minutes. Additionally, these greens are high in vitamins, folate, and potassium, which are lost during cooking. However, if you crave something cooked like kale enchiladas, you will still benefit from the green’s beta-carotene content. Tomatoes and Red Bell Peppers
Lycopene, a carotenoid and antioxidant that makes these gems red, is thought to reduce cancer risk and promote heart health. A study revealed that cooking tomatoes leads to higher levels lycopene, which, like beta-carotene, is found in cell walls. However, the same research concluded that vitamin C levels declined in cooked tomatoes. Top your pizza with raw tomatoes and red bell peppers to have it all. Spinach
You can do no wrong with this superfood. Spinach contains oxalates and calcium, which can lead to kidney stones if too much is ingested. Cooking spinach, however, removes the risk by breaking oxalates down. Additionally, cooking will help the absorption of spinach’s supply of beta-carotene and lutein (a carotenoid necessary for eye health). If spinach is the base of your daily salad, never fear: spinach is full of vitamins, magnesium, potassium, folate, and more—all of which are depleted when the vegetable is cooked. Onion, Leek, and Scallion
These blubs boast vitamins B6, C, and K, as well as folate and potassium. They also contain the anti-inflammatory compound quercetin, which is reduced by boiling but is actually increased by baking and sautéing. Nevertheless, cooking will reduce these vegetables’ vitamin and mineral content, so make sure your next batch of salsa includes some raw onion and scallion. Garlic
Garlic has been known to fight cancer, enhance immunity, and lower cholesterol. Allicin, an anti-microbial compound found in garlic, is destroyed by heat: cook garlic no longer than five minutes to utilize allicin’s benefits. Cooked garlic still retains flavonoids, selenium, and other sulfur compounds, so not all is lost in the heat. Quick-cooking methods such as steaming and stir-frying are ideal for cooking vegetables, but the best way to benefit from soups and salads is simple: mix it up! Why not have a spinach salad with casserole, or some raw soup with a stir-fry? After all, variety is the spice of life.  "

GREEN YOUR DIET WITH MORE THAN JUICE,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/green-your-diet-with-more-than-juice,"FEBRUARY 20, 2011","Fresh green juice is all the rage, but if you don’t have a juicer at home or the budget for a daily green smoothie from your local juice shop, how can you get all the health benefits from great leafy greens? We share some simple tips and explain the difference between these powerhouse vegetables so you can shop and eat smart. After all, greens are the new black. It’s Easy Being Green
It can be easy to be a junk-food vegan nowadays with all the wonderful assortment of vegan doughnuts, nacho cheeses, candy bars, and ice creams. And while fun treats are good every so often, it’s best to balance your diet with good-for-you veggies. Tender, dark greens pack a powerful nutritional punch as they are full of fiber, beta carotene, calcium, iron, folic acid, and chlorophyll. In addition to those nutrients, collards, kale, and bok choy also contain a healthy dose of vitamin C. Leaf Love
When shopping, always look for crisp, vibrant leaves and stay away from any that are yellowing, which indicate that the vegetable is old. Kale is in season from mid-summer through December and collard greens are best from January to April. Mild greens like collards, chard, bok choy, and spinach are perfect for adding to recipes since they won’t drastically change the taste of the final meal. Kale has a medium-sharp taste so it may be best as a side or as a salad, though, if you like a bold flavor, kale is great. Typically, one pound of fresh greens will equate to 2 to 3 servings since greens tend to shrink when cooked. Wash the leaves thoroughly before cooking to remove any dirt. You can store them in the refrigerator for a few days, but greens are best used fresh. Wrapping a damp paper towel around collard greens and kale before storing them in the fridge will help them stay crisp. Be sure to remove the tough stems of collards and kale before eating. The tender stems of spinach, bok choy, and chard can be eaten. Ready, Set, Green
Not sure how to use these wonderful greens? Here’s a breakdown of their tastes and some ideas of how they can be used. Bok choy is sweet, mild, and tends to stay crisp when cooked. Try it in salads, stir fries, and soup. It’s a perfect veggie to add to your favorite Asian dishes like Tofu and Vegetable Lo Mein. Kale is tender with a slight peppery taste and can be boiled, steamed, and sautéed. Swiss chard can be found in three colors: red, green, or rainbow, and it’s a multipurpose green that can be used in just about any recipe, however, red chard may naturally “dye” other foods. Try pairing chard with sweet figs for the ultimate side dish (Rainbow Chard with Figs). Collard greens, which can steamed, braised, or sautéed, tend to shrink less than other greens, and have a mild, sweet flavor. Used widely in Southern cooking, collard greens are a hearty accompaniment for any home-cooked meals (try Southern Style Collard Greens). Known for being soft and sweet, spinach tends to shrink the most of all the greens so a large bunch of spinach will cook quickly. Eaten raw in salads or added to any dish, spinach blends in nicely with most meals. During a busy workweek, it can sometimes seem tough to prepare fresh greens for dinner. Save some time by washing and cutting your greens on the weekend so they are ready when you need them. A simple salad spinner can make washing greens an easy (even fun) task. Or check your local grocery store’s frozen section for spinach, kale, or collard greens for a sure fire way to always have these on hand. It can be easy to skip getting fresh vegetables in favor of ready-made meals, but adding greens to your diet, whether cooked or as juice, will rev up your health. Recipes to Try

SHARK FIN BAN,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/shark-fin-ban,"FEBRUARY 14, 2011","California state legislators have introduced a bill that would outlaw the possession, sale, and distribution of shark fins. The bill was introduced by assemblymen Paul Fong of Sunnyvale and Jared Huffman of San Rafael, and is backed by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and The Humane Society of the United States. The practice of shark finning usually involves slicing off sharks’ fins, and then throwing the animals back into the ocean where they bleed or suffocate to death from their inability to swim. Using only the fin of the animal leads to around 26 to 73 million sharks deaths per year, according to the NRDC. In recent decades, shark populations have declined by as much as 90 percent. "

MEAT PRODUCERS HURTING,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/meat-producers-hurting,"FEBRUARY 14, 2011","Rising food prices, Meatless Mondays, new USDA dietary guidelines, and a growing body of research urging Americans to eat less meat are hurting beef and pork producers in the US. Beef and pork consumption have dropped by nine and four pounds per person, respectively, since 2000. The meat industry believes that the biggest culprit for the reduction is the increased price of meat due to rising corn feed prices, while claiming campaigns to reduce consumption are misguided as consumers need the protein and nutrients that beef and pork provide. The average American eats about 110 pounds of beef and pork per year. "
TYSON BRIBES INSPECTORS,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/tyson-bribes-inspectors,"FEBRUARY 13, 2011","Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint against Tyson Foods for bribery. According to the filings, from 2004 to 2006, Tyson de Mexico, a subsidiary of Tyson Foods, bribed two Mexican-state inspectors with more than $100,000 to ensure the plant’s chicken met health and safety laws. “As a result of the payments, Tyson Foods realized net profits of more than $880,000 from export sales from its Tyson de Mexico facilities in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006,” according to the complaint. In 2009, Tyson slaughtered an average of 41.4 million chickens per week. "
FACTORY FARM DISEASES,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/factory-farm-diseases,"FEBRUARY 13, 2011","In its most recent report, the International Livestock Research Institute found that a boom in meat production encourages epidemics. New diseases appear approximately every four months, and while many are not dangerous, diseases such as avian flu, H1N1 swine flu, and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) have “huge potential impacts.” Researchers found that more than 60 percent of transmissible human pathogens originate from intensely confined farm animals. While wealthy countries can keep farm animals relatively disease-free, poorer ones do not have as much capacity to control outbreaks. Costs, however, are felt everywhere—the SARS epidemic of 2003 cost $50 to $100 billion worldwide. "

LAUNCH A VEGAN BUSINESS WITH KICKSTARTER,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/launch-a-vegan-business-with-kickstarter,"FEBRUARY 13, 2011","Whether it is to pen the next great American novel, open a bar where there’s never a last call, or start a band, everyone has a dream. Unfortunately, with unemployment more than nine percent and many Americans fighting to get by, opening a vegan pizza parlor might seem less than probable. However, with an online fundraising system called Kickstarter, vegans all over the country are making their wildest dreams come true with a little help from like-minded donors. Kicking Around an Idea
The idea of Kickstarter, founded in 2009 by Charles Adler, Perry Chen, and Yancey Strickler, was born from financial anguish. In 2002, Chen thought of the idea after cancelling a concert due to insufficient funds, then later shared the idea with Strickler. The pair raised the start-up money from family and friends and launched the website with the help of tech designer Adler. Less than two years later, Kickstarter is the world’s largest funding platform for creative projects. Kick off a Campaign
Kickstarter uses a platform known as crowd-funding, wherein an organization facilitates fundraising from the general public. Project owners create pages on the Kickstarter website telling potential donors about their idea, from its inception to how much money they need and how the donations will be used. If project owners reach their pledge amount in their self-chosen timeframe, they keep it. If not, no money is exchanged between donors and project owners. In addition, project owners keep 100-percent ownership and control over their projects. For projects to be successful, a good story and donor rewards are key. The more potential donors can indentify with a story, the more those donors will be willing to anonymously give to a certain project, and creating an engaging video is hugely important. Chen says that projects with videos have a higher success rate. “What’s great about video is that it allows you to connect especially with people that don’t already know you. It’s an amazing introduction,” Chen says. Additionally, those projects that utilize Kickstarter’s rewards system often achieve their funding goals. Cakeface, a specialty vegan baked goods business in Portland, Maine, successfully fundraised $1,545 for advertising and a storefront. For pledges of $10, Cakeface sent a handwritten thank-you card; for pledges of $100, donors also received a card, but got a t-shirt, and six cupcakes as well. Vegan Ventures Alive and Kicking
From cookbooks to edible vegan dishware, vegan entrepreneurs all over the country have had success with the help of Kickstarter’s platform. Sweet Ritual, an Austin, Texas-based vegan ice cream company with flavors ranging from chocolate and lavender to Faux Butterfinger, is opening a brand-new storefront in 2011 thanks in part to Kickstarter donations. Sonya Cotton, a vegan musician from San Francisco, Calif., recently met her $10,000 goal to fund a new album. Louisville, Ken., chef Stanley Chase III made his wish of opening a vegan food truck come to life in January by raising $13,002 (surpassing his goal of $12,000) to buy a food truck, cover operating costs, and purchase equipment for his venture, Morels Food Truck. Chase can now make his homemade buffalo seitan wings thanks to strangers from Los Angeles to The Netherlands who, the chef said, “believe in what I’m doing.” From bakeries to rock bands, Kickstarter is a clever grassroots way to make vegan fantasies become meat-free realities. With a good idea, creativity, and enthusiasm, anyone can start a new venture, expand an existing business, or find a supportive customer base. "

Dale Vince, a vegan and the club owner, says of the decision, “If red meat was not good enough to feed our players, then it wasn’t good enough for our staff, fans, and visitors too.” Moves against animal products have been popular of late in the European country—this week a campaign was launched to stop battery dairy farming after a UK dairy farm proposed its continuation. Battery farming keeps dairy cows from grazing in pastures. "

Titled “The Moral Crusade Against Foodies,” writer B.R. Myers declares the nation’s ‘foodie’ phenomena a celebration of “mindless, sweating gluttony.” He calls foodies out for their elitism and “gluttonous” meat consumption, such as eating rare and endangered animals (Bourdain has consumed guinea pig, bat, and raw seal). “The more lives sacrificed for a dinner, the more impressive the eater,” Meyers states, noting the machismo surrounding foodie-ism, and he adds that “The foodies’ pride in eating ‘nose to tail’ is no different from factory-farm boasts of ‘using everything but the oink.’” "
REBEL GARDENERS,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/rebel-gardeners,"FEBRUARY 10, 2011","The Articultores, a group of artists, are planting thousands of vegetable seeds in neglected parks and lots throughout Buenos Aires.

PROTECTION FOR VEAL CALVES,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/protection-for-veal-calves,"FEBRUARY 8, 2011","The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has tentatively approved rules to protect downed veal calves, those unable to stand, from slaughter abuse, in response to a petition filed by The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). The rules, if finalized, would close loopholes allowing the slaughter of young calves who are too sick or injured to walk. In 2009, HSUS conducted an undercover investigation of Bushway Packing, Inc. in Grand Isle, Ver., where infant calves were found subjected to repeated electric shocks, kicking, hoof cutting, and even partial decapitation. In response, federal officials shut down the slaughter plant, and the USDA is now granting HSUS its petition and will solicit comments before the new rules are implemented. "

ISA CHANDRA MOSKOWITZ TALKS APPETITE FOR REDUCTION,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/isa-chandra-moskowitz-talks-appetite-for-reduction,"FEBRUARY 8, 2011","There’s probably no introduction needed for the author of some of the most popular vegan cookbooks on the planet, including Vegan with a Vengeance, Veganomicon, and Vegan Brunch. Luckily, Isa Chandra Moskowitz was able to take some time to chat with us about her new book, Appetite for Reduction, as well as talk about some other exciting projects in the works!

VegNews: Appetite for Reduction differs from your previous cookbooks a good deal. Did you have any reservations about writing a book about weight-loss?
Isa Chandra Moskowitz: It’s actually not a book about weight-loss (newsflash: I’m fat!). Rather, it’s a cookbook with low-fat recipes. It’s really about eating healthier and reducing fat intake because people should be eating healthfully at any size. I eat broccoli because I love it! I personally feel much better when I eat this way. I know that veganism as a weight loss diet is kind of the hype right now, but there are lots of us fatter vegans out there, and we too like to eat healthy and exercise. I’m trying not to stress out about weight so much, because that leads to some really unsavory behaviors and a bad state of mind.

VN: You’re known for creating full-flavor, crowd-pleasing vegan recipes—was it challenging to maintain those expectations while lowering the calorie and fat content of the dishes?
ICM: It was actually a lot of fun to develop flavors without all the fatty ingredient crutches. At first it was a bit challenging, because really, you’re thinking, if this is going to be the first vegan food someone is tasting, you want it to be the best. So it was hard not to think “OK, coleslaw, let’s smother it in vegan mayo!” or something along those lines, because fat and creaminess are instantly pleasing. Once I figured out ways to get creaminess out of things like beans, and a small handful of nuts, it was on. Also, I really wanted everything to be whole-foods based. Often times, it’s really the texture of low-fat foods that’s a turn off, so I tried to build filling textures with methods like roasting and pureeing. I tried to make each recipe a mini-cooking lesson, so that you have new kitchen skills for life.

VN: What is your favorite recipe from Appetite for Reduction?
ICM: That is a really tough question, but I’m just answering it with the recipes I make most, which thus far have been the Edamame Pesto, Pot Pie Stew, and the Everyday Chickpea-Quinoa Salad, in some form or another.

VN: You’ve written books solo and with Terry Hope Romero—how different is your process when writing alone?
ICM: It’s so lonely! When Terry and I are working together we just tag team. Since I left Brooklyn, we’ll have hours-worth of video chatting, discussing nothing but hazelnuts—with a little gossip thrown in. Writing a book alone is more introspective, because you don’t have that second set of taste buds, which can be so fickle! Sometimes I crave nothing but black beans for a week, so that can make for some dull recipe writing. But the nice part of writing alone is that every recipe becomes your story and you never have to ask for permission.

VN: What’s next after this? Any books in the works, and are you working on any other projects?
ICM: Terry and I are working on a pie book to end all pie books. And no, that’s not a low-fat book. I’m living in Omaha now, and I hope to have some kind of business here, so that’s been a hot topic in my life. I guess I plan on lots of travel in the next year or so, plus lots of recipe developing and hopefully many successful bake sales and fundraisers along the way. "
FARM TO FRIDGE DEBUTS,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/farm-to-fridge-debuts,"FEBRUARY 8, 2011"," Mercy for Animals’ latest film, Farm to Fridge, was released today. The 12-minute film depicts some of the most heinous treatment that animals raised for food routinely face, and is narrated by vegan actor James Cromwell. Hot on the heels of undercover investigations that have exposed horrific animal cruelty on egg, dairy, and veal farms, fish slaughtering facilities, and poultry slaughterhouses, Farm to Fridge gives viewers a total picture of the egregiously cruel state of animal agriculture. VegNews talked with MFA Founder and Executive Director Nathan Runkle about the film. VegNews: What sets it apart from the undercover footage MFA has already publicized?
Nathan Runkle: Farm to Fridge is a silver bullet—it covers the treatment of animals exploited by the pork, beef, dairy, egg, poultry, and seafood industries, all in 12 unforgettable minutes. The film utilizes footage from all of MFA’s past undercover investigations, and gives a powerful look at the entire journey each animal makes from birth to death. VN: How did the partnership with James Cromwell come about?
NR: James was our first choice to narrate the film. In addition to being an Academy Award-nominee and seasoned actor, he is an ethical vegan, a dedicated, sincere, and passionate animal-rights advocate, and has an incredibly impactful voice. We approached James about this project and he eagerly jumped onboard. We are so thrilled and grateful to be partnering with him.
 
VN: What’s your best-case-scenario, dream result of this film?
NR: Our goal is to have the film viewed at least 1 million times in the next 12 months. We hope that everyone who sees the film will share it with at least 10 of their friends, and so on. Each person who is inspired to go vegan by this film translates into thousands of animals, over their lifetime, spared the horrors exposed in Farm to Fridge.
 
VN: Why make this particular film right now?
NR: There is no doubt that our nation’s treatment of farmed animals is a growing topic of concern and focus for more and more Americans. However, few people know the graphic details of how cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and fish truly live, and die, before reaching their plates. We felt the time was right to elevate the discussion and produce a film that didn’t shy away or sugarcoat the true cost of meat, dairy and eggs. Most people care about animals and simply wouldn’t support the sheer brutality perpetrated every moment on factory farms and in slaughterhouses, if they knew about it. However, few people know how animals are intensively confined, mutilated without painkillers, cruelly beaten, and violently slaughtered. Farm to Fridge serves as a wake-up call to the fact that modern animal agriculture is out of step with most Americans’ core values, and that immediate change is desperately needed.
 
VN: What moment in the film do you think will surprise people the most?
NR: There are so many shocking moments in the film because, quite frankly, our treatment of farmed animals is shocking. Not a single federal law provides protection to farmed animals during their lives on factory farms—meaning that billions of these animals are subjected to abuses so extreme that meat, egg, and dairy producers could be jailed if they treated dogs or cats in the same manner. I think some of the most surprising moments of the film are standard practices on factory farms—practices considered acceptable and legal in most states—such as: piglets having their testicles ripped out of their bodies and their tails chopped off without painkillers; male chicks ground up alive in giant macerators; and fish being skinned and dismembered while still alive, conscious and suffering.

VN: Do you think that there’s been an uptick in the horrible treatment of animals in the last few years, or are we just beginning to discover horrific practices that have long been industry standards?
NR: Mercy For Animals is dedicated to serving as the eyes and ears of the public who are kept largely in the dark about how “food animals” are treated. Quite simply, these animals have no watchdogs—the meat, dairy, and egg industries cannot be trusted to self-regulate, and the government has neither the tools, resources, nor motivation to oversee these facilities—so it’s up to organizations like MFA to expose these abuses. Sadly, the abuse farmed animals endure is nothing new. Factory farming values profit over principle in the ever-increasing race to reduce costs and increase revenue. In the end, animals are left to pay the ultimate price—a life of extreme deprivation and suffering. As long as farmed animals are viewed and treated as mere commodities, whose sole function is to produce as much meat, milk and eggs as possible, exploitation and abuse will run rampant. We will continue pointing our hidden cameras at these morally bankrupt industries, exposing the hidden horrors farmed animals endure. I’m confident that once more Americans see for themselves the truth behind modern animal agriculture, they will choose to withdraw their support and embrace a healthy and compassionate vegan diet.

CURRENT BILLS AND LAWS FIGHTING FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/current-bills-and-laws-fighting-for-animal-rights,"FEBRUARY 6, 2011","In an ideal world, all animals would not be raised for slaughter, but since 10 billion animals each year are currently raised to be eaten in the US alone, laws need to be set in place that protect those animals from the most egregiously cruel farming practices used today. Factory-farm laws are state-by-state cases that need legislation and a majority of voters to pass the law since one of the few federal laws in place for animals is the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act enacted in 1958, which exempts birds (the majority of animals raised for food). Currently, Washington has a pending ballot to ban battery cages to be voted on in 2011. Here’s a look at laws currently on the books and what’s in store for the future. What’s Passed
In November 2008, almost two-thirds of California voters passed Proposition 2, which raised the standards of living conditions for factory-farm animals. The proposition bans battery cages for laying hens, confining veal crates, and gestation crates for pigs. These major changes will be instituted in all factory farms by 2015. In July 2010, a California law was passed that all eggs will be cage free by 2015. Very similar to Proposition 2, Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm signed bill HB 5127 into law in October 2009 that also bans battery cages, veal crates, and gestation crates. With the instrumental help of The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), 121 new state animal-protection laws passed in 2009. Paul Shapiro, senior director for the End Factory Farming campaign for HSUS, comments, “Progress for animals is not inevitable—laws don’t pass themselves. It is the product of a lot of people’s hard work.” Shapiro adds, “I feel confident, because of the great number of dedicated animal advocates, that we will make more meaningful progress each year on behalf of animals.” Under Legislation
A new bill, the Massachusetts Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, was introduced by Rep. Jason M. Lewis and Sen. Robert L. Hedlund, which would require similar provisions as Proposition 2 in California. Currently, there are pending ballots in both Washington and Oregon to ban battery cages. HSUS is pursuing a bill in the Oregon legislature, but if it fails, then the ballot measure would be voted on in 2012. Originally proposed but failed in 2010, a bill to ban the sale and production of foie gras in Hawaii is being reintroduced by Hawaiian Rep. Angus McKelvey and Sens. Mike Gabbard, Chun Oakland, and Clayton Hee. If the bill is passed, Hawaii will join California and 15 countries in banning the dish. State by State
Seven states ban the use of gestation crates: Florida, Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, California, Maine, and Michigan. The use of veal crates is outlawed in Arizona, Colorado, California, Maine, and Michigan. Battery cages are banned in California and Michigan with California taking one step further to ban the sale of any eggs that come from battery-cage facilities. In addition to these measures, California also bans tail docking of dairy cows. With all of California’s steps to ensure some degree of protection, the state ranked number one in HSUS’ ranking of all 50 states based on 65 different animal-protection issues in 10 major categories. New Jersey was a close second. The lowest ranking states—Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota and South Dakota—earned such low scores (South Dakota got a score of 8 out of 65) because these four states don’t have any felony penalties for animal cruelty. The official rankings and each state’s score are listed on the Humane Society’s website. With Washington’s ballot to ban battery cages to be voted on this year and several states passing laws that deal with factory-farming conditions, it’s hopeful society will become conscientious of animals’ need for better protection—including not being considered food.

MAD COW TEST,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/mad-cow-test,"FEBRUARY 5, 2011","British researchers have developed a new blood test that can screen for the abnormal prion protein that is associated with mad cow disease, officially called Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. A test of 190 blood samples, resulted in a 70 percent accuracy rate. Since mad cow disease is also passed through blood transfusions, researchers hope the test could one day be used to identify contaminated blood to prevent further disease. They say, however, that in its current state, the test may not detect early stages of the disease and will need further testing before being implemented. Mad cow disease has killed 171 people and more than 4 million cattle worldwide. "
LEA MICHELE AT SUPER BOWL,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/lea-michele-at-super-bowl,"FEBRUARY 4, 2011","Vegan, actress, and activist Lea Michele will sing at this Sunday’s Super Bowl game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The 24-year old star of Glee will sing “America the Beautiful” as part of the pre-game festivities. The game will also feature Christina Aguilera, who will sing the national anthem, and the Black Eyed Peas, who will perform at halftime. A native New Yorker, Michele recently teamed up with PETA to campaign against horse-drawn carriages and often credits her vegan diet with her health and energy. "
SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/salmonella-contamination,"FEBRUARY 3, 2011","Milk powder from a Grade B dairy plant in Winthrop, Minnesota tested positive for Salmonella S in a test conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Grade B milk is used for cheese, while Grade A is sold for direct consumption. While the FDA could not determine the exact source of the contamination, they did find a number of other violations during the inspection, including incorrectly sanitized equipment and food contact surfaces, as well as the failure of employees to wash and sanitize their hands adequately. There have not yet been any reports of illness due to the contamination. "
FOOD ASSISTANCE OBESITY,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/food-assistance-obesity,"FEBRUARY 3, 2011","Food assistance programs may be doing more harm than good in cities where food is expensive, say researchers at George Washington University and Rice University. A recent study found that federal assistance programs, in particular the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, may be contributing to early childhood obesity. While these programs have potential to combat obesity by influencing what people eat, the study states that evidence shows counterproductive effects as recipients resort to lower-cost, less nutritional foods. The study recommends including greater outreach, dietary guidelines, and cost-of-living supplements to be more effective. Currently one-third of children are overweight, and 16 percent are obese. "
OYSTERS BECOMING EXTINCT,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/oysters-becoming-extinct,"FEBRUARY 3, 2011","Disease and over-harvesting have contributed to the “functional extinction” of oysters in many places. An international research team studied oyster reefs in 144 bays and 40 ecoregions, finding that most of these reefs are at less than 10 percent of their prior abundance. The study suggests those reefs be closed to further harvesting to allow the mollusks to repopulate. Five North American locations are home to some 75 percent of the remaining wild oysters in the world—in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, only one percent of the former oyster reefs still exist. "
EPA IMPROVES WATER LAWS,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/epa-improves-water-laws,"FEBRUARY 2, 2011","Between 5 and 17 million Americans are exposed to perchlorate, a toxic rocket-fuel ingredient linked to thyroid problems, especially in pregnant women and young children, in their tap water. After pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Obama administration announced that it will develop the first laws regulating the chemical’s limit in drinking water. Perchlorate contamination has been found in 45 states, and is known to have tainted 153 public water systems, according to EPA data. The agency also hopes to regulate 16 other toxic chemicals in drinking water that may pose risks to human health. "
FAST-FOOD SIGNS CAUSE STRESS,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/fast-food-signs-cause-stress,"FEBRUARY 2, 2011","Studies suggest people can suffer from fast food without actually eating it. Researchers at the University of Toronto found that incidental and unconscious exposure to fast-food symbols—a McDonald’s sign, for example—immediately causes feelings of impatience and feeling stressed for time. Researchers found that subjects, after seeing the golden arches, would begin reading at a faster rate, as if pressed for time. In another experiment, subjects became impatient about financial decisions after seeing a fast-food sign, choosing smaller, immediate payments over larger, delayed ones. Researchers believe the unconscious priming is due to 50 years of fast-food marketing, “a culture that emphasizes time efficiency and immediate gratification.” "
SPINACH FUELS MUSCLES,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/spinach-fuels-muscles,"FEBRUARY 2, 2011","Popeye’s secret weapon is not iron, but the nitrates found in spinach, say Swedish researchers from the Karolinska Institute. They found that eating 300 grams (close to 1½ cups) of spinach per day reduces the amount of oxygen needed to power muscles. The nitrates act as “a fuel additive for your muscles—it makes them run much more smoothly,” said lead scientist Dr. Eddie Weitzberg. They do so by helping increase the efficiency of mitochondria, the part of the cell that is responsible for fueling cell activity and growth. The effects are apparent after only three days of eating spinach. Nitric oxide has also been known to open blood vessels and lower blood pressure. "
HAWAII TO BAN FOIE GRAS,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/hawaii-to-ban-foie-gras,"FEBRUARY 1, 2011","Hawaiian Rep. Angus McKelvey and Sens. Mike Gabbard, Chun Oakland, and Clayton Hee have co-sponsored a bill to ban the production and sale of foie gras in Hawaii, a bill that was considered in 2010 but did not pass committee. If the bill is passed, Hawaii will join California and 15 countries in banning the dish. Foie gras is created by force-feeding ducks and geese through feeding tubes in order to create a fatty liver 10 times its normal size. Three US companies produce foie gras, making 300 tons per year—five times more than 30 years ago. "
DISTRACTION BOOSTS OVEREATING,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/distraction-boosts-overeating,"FEBRUARY 1, 2011","Distracted eating fosters overconsumption, a recent study at the University of Bristol, England, found. In a lunch experiment, half of the participants were asked to eat in front of a computer while playing the game solitaire, while the other half were told to focus on their meal. Those who ate in front of the computer found their meal less filling, and when allowed dessert (disguised as a taste test), ate twice as many cookies as the mindful eaters. Researchers say that memory plays a role in how we register what we eat and the degree to which it satisfies. Currently, US children consume about a quarter of their food while watching television. "
BIG AG TEAMS UP,https://vegnews.com/2011/2/big-ag-teams-up,"FEBRUARY 1, 2011","Some of the country’s largest farm groups, including the National Corn Growers Association and the National Pork Producers Council, have formed the US Farmers and Ranchers Alliance in order to fight negative press due to multiple food recalls and animal-rights violations. Leaders say the group will likely use social media to increase popularity. Still, animal-rights activists believe a social-media campaign will not sway consumers: Paul Shapiro, senior director for HSUS’ End Factory Farming Campaign, says, “It doesn’t matter what media they’re using, defending practices most Americans consider indefensible is not a smart strategy for the ag industry.” "
LAB-GROWN MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/lab-grown-meat,"JANUARY 31, 2011","Animal-free meat is on its way to solving the global food crisis, say scientists at the Medical University of South Carolina. Dr. Vladimir Mironov has been working on growing bioengineered meat in his laboratory, currently using turkey cells and growing animal skeletal muscle tissue on a scaffold. The food would be functional, natural, and could be designed into any type of texture or specific meat. Mironov’s lab, however, has not received enough government funding to bring in the new technology. Yet Nicholas Genovese, a PETA-funded biologist working in Mironov’s meat-growing lab, says that cultured meat is more eco-friendly and could become cheaper than farmed meat. "
LIPTON TEA IS ANIMAL-FREE,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/lipton-tea-is-animal-free,"JANUARY 31, 2011","Unilever, a multi-national corporation that owns many of the world’s consumer product brands, such as Slim-Fast, Hellman’s, and Bertolli, announced that it will eliminate animal testing on Lipton tea and tea-based products. The company says that the ban is a result of Lipton tea being a leader in “the area of environmental sustainability and the ethical sourcing of tea.” The announcement follows a PETA UK report that stated the company tested Lipton tea on rabbits in order to market the tea as having health benefits, which sparked a massive PETA UK protest. "
GUIDELINES UP FRUITS AND VEG,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/guidelines-up-fruits-and-veg,"JANUARY 31, 2011","The latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans released yesterday addresses the nation’s obesity rate and urges Americans to eat less food, specifically soda, pizza, desserts, and cheese. The guidelines also suggest that at least half of a plate for each meal should be covered in fruits and vegetables. Cutting salt, saturated fats, and eating whole grains were also included. While many of the recommendations seem obvious, Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition at New York University, says it is major progress and that “[the guidelines] are blunter here than they’ve ever been before, and they deserve credit for that.” The Department of Agriculture revises the nutrition guidelines every five years. "
OPRAH GOES VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/oprah-goes-vegan,"JANUARY 31, 2011","On February 1, the most influential woman in America will discuss going vegan. Oprah, along with 378 of her employees, spent one week on “The Vegan Challenge,” cutting meat, dairy, and all other animal products from their diets. Tuesday’s show will include Michael Pollan, journalist Lisa Ling, who will take the audience on a tour of a slaughterhouse, and vegan author Kathy Freston, who will promote her new book, Veganist. Oprah has previously gone vegan—in 2008 she participated in a 21-day vegan cleanse as a part of Kathy Freston’s book, Quantum Wellness (a VN Veggie Award winner for the same year). Vegans across the country are organizing viewing parties for Tuesday’s show—VN will be attending the party in San Francisco.  "

Erin McKenna, owner of the Babycakes franchise, will soon release her second cookbook, titled Babycakes Covers the Classics: Gluten-Free Vegan Recipes from Donuts to Snickerdoodles. The cookbook will include recipes for thin mints, s’mores, madeleines, and more, in addition to a FAQ section. The book is already generating positive buzz: Publishers Weekly reported that the snickerdoodles were “incredible.” The book is set to release on April 12. "
COOK BROCCOLI RIGHT,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/cook-broccoli-right,"JANUARY 30, 2011","Broccoli has been known to have potent anti-cancer qualities, but a new study shows that when overcooked, it no longer retains its health-promoting enzymes. University of Illinois nutrition professor Elizabeth Jeffery says that overcooked broccoli contains no myrosinase, the enzyme responsible for forming broccoli’s cancer-preventive and anti-inflammatory components. The study also found that broccoli powder does little as it is missing myrosinase, but pairing sprouts with properly cooked broccoli can double the cancer-fighting effects. Steaming the vegetable for a few minutes or eating it raw is the ideal way to protect the enzyme. "
USDA’S UNSAFE CHICKEN,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/usdas-unsafe-chicken,"JANUARY 30, 2011","The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has rushed for the approval of an interim rule that will allow the US to increase poultry imports from China, whose imports have often been found contaminated. The chicken would be approved by the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service before making it into grocery stores, but even areas of China that have experienced avian flu outbreaks would be allowed to export. Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch, believes the new rule “smacks of political pressure”—the move was made only days after China’s President Hu Jintao’s visit to the US. "
VEG FOOD AT SUPER BOWL,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/veg-food-at-super-bowl,"JANUARY 29, 2011","Vendors at this year’s Super Bowl Tailgate Party have announced they will also be serving vegetarian fare along with traditional meat- and dairy-laden dishes. The House of Lane Catering and Food Company based in Dallas will be serving 2,000 vegetarian bruschettas at the festivities—some of the snacks include sun-dried tomato basil bread with Kalamata olives and a cinnamon raisin loaf. To get the spot, House of Lane had to compete with 928 other women- and minority-owned businesses. These businesses will account for only a small piece of the $612 million regional impact from the Super Bowl. "
BIG FIRMS INCREASE FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/big-firms-increase-food,"JANUARY 28, 2011","Major business leaders working with USAID announced a plan to increase food production by 20 percent, cut greenhouse gas emission by 20 percent, and reduce rural poverty by 20 percent in the next decade, at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, and Unilever are amongst the 17 companies that will invest in governments and farmers to scale up sustainable agriculture in food-insecure countries like Tanzania and Vietnam. The plan, titled the New Vision for Agriculture, aims to double the amount of food the planet produces by 2050. A recent Global Food and Farming report stated that it will also be necessary to cut meat consumption in order to prevent widespread starvation. "

The event is the brainchild of Sarah Gross, founder of Rescue Chocolate, a company that donates all net profits to animal-rescue organizations; and Nira Paliwoda, an event planner and foodie. “This is inevitable for a city with so many conscious eaters,” Paliwoda says. “None of us can believe that it has never happened on this scale before.” The festival will have free admission and include samples from vegetarian restaurants, animal welfare information tables, live music, speakers, and a raffle benefitting Empty Cages Collective. "
MASSACHUSETTS CURBING CRUELTY,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/massachusetts-curbing-cruelty,"JANUARY 27, 2011","A new bill, introduced by Rep. Jason M. Lewis and Minority Whip Sen. Robert L. Hedlund, would require that veal crates for calves, battery cages for egg-laying hens, and gestation crates for breeding pigs be large enough for the animals to freely move. Farm Sanctuary has announced its support for the Massachusetts Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, stating that “confining animals in cages so small they can barely move is inhumane and it is not aligned with the values of the compassionate people of Massachusetts.” Seven states have already passed laws to ban one or more of these factory-farm abuses, and others are introducing initiatives for upcoming elections. "
JUNK FOOD DEPRESSION,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/junk-food-depression,"JANUARY 27, 2011","A new preventative medicine study shows that a diet high in saturated and trans-fat increases the risk of depression. Researchers at University Las Palmas in Spain studied more than 12,000 men and women who were initially free of depression. In the six years the study took place, 657 new cases had been diagnosed, finding that participants who ate mostly fast food, industrially-produced pastries, and whole milk products had 48 percent increased risk of depression. With separate studies showing that preschoolers’ preference for high fat, sugar, and salt foods is linked to fast food and soda brand knowledge, health experts say that families should focus on reducing the consumption of junk foods early on. "
FIRST FUR-FREE CITY PLANS,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/first-fur-free-city-plans,"JANUARY 26, 2011","Activist group Fur Free WeHo and city council candidate John D’Amico are working on a campaign to ban the sale of fur products in West Hollywood, Calif. Organizers say they have a good chance of convincing the City Council to pass the initiative, since West Hollywood has a history of animal-welfare protection. The city was declared a “cruelty-free zone for animals” in 1989 after passing a resolution to ban cosmetic testing on animals, and recently also made illegal the declawing of cats and prohibited pet stores from doing business with puppy mills. Should the initiative pass, West Hollywood would be the first fur-free city in the nation. "
CARDIAC COSTS TO TRIPLE,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/cardiac-costs-to-triple,"JANUARY 26, 2011","A study published in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association found that the costs to treat heart disease in the US will triple by 2030, from $273 billion to $818 billion. The study estimated the price tag based on current disease rates and anticipated population shifts based on Census data; however, the study does not account for new treatment discoveries. The study states prevention strategies as necessary to curb heart disease, which currently affects one in every three Americans. Late last year, researchers at Oxford found that people who consumed eight or more servings of produce per day were 22 percent less likely to die from ischemic heart disease than those who consumed three or fewer servings. "
FDA POSTPONES MILK TESTS,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/fda-postpones-milk-tests,"JANUARY 26, 2011","The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has postponed testing dairy cows for antibiotics. The FDA intended to begin tests this month on cows’ milk from farms that had repeatedly sold tainted milk, but the dairy industry fought the tests, claiming that they were poorly conceived and would waste millions of gallons of milk. As a result, the FDA postponed the testing and is now conferring with the dairy industry on future steps. Food safety advocates continue to voice concern, however. Just last week, the FDA found a dairy cow from California with antibiotics at a rate of 7.068 parts per million in her tissue at the time of slaughter—the federal limit is 0.1 parts per million. "

TACO BELL GETS SUED,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/taco-bell-gets-sued,"JANUARY 25, 2011","According to Beasley Allen, an Alabama law firm, Taco Bell’s beef filling does not meet the U.S. Department of Agricultures (USDA) definition of the word. The USDA requires taco meat filling to contain a minimum of 40 percent fresh meat, but according to Beasley Allen, the fast-food chain’s filling is only 36 percent actual cows’ meat. The rest of the filling is made of soy lecithin, maltodextrin, wheat oats, anti-dusting agent, sodium phosphates, and other non-meat “extenders.” The law firm is filing a class-action lawsuit objecting to these ingredients. Taco Bell denies the allegations and states that it will “vigorously defend the suit.” "
VOLUNTARY NUTRITION LABEL,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/voluntary-nutrition-label,"JANUARY 25, 2011","Later this year, the front of many packaged food items will display “Nutrition Key” labels. The voluntary label, made by the Food Marketing Institute and the Grocery Association independent of the FDA, will feature information like calorie, fat, and sugar content, as well as information the manufacturer deems beneficial, such as vitamins and protein. The label’s creators said that First Lady Michelle Obama served as the catalyst for the new label. “We would not be here today if she had not defined the common objective,” says Pamela Bailey, President and CEO of the Grocery Manufacturers Association. The First Lady’s Let’s Move initiative hopes to rid the US of childhood obesity within a generation. "
RECOMMENDED MEAT TAX,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/recommended-meat-tax,"JANUARY 25, 2011","In one of the largest studies of its kind, UK’s Foresight think-tank published the most recent “Global Food and Farming Futures” study. With contributions from more than 400 experts in 35 countries, the report predicts that food production will no longer be able to keep up with population growth in the next 40 years. In order to prevent further widespread starvation, the study states that food waste needs to be halved. Since grain-fed meat production is one of the most wasteful farming practices, the report recommends taxing and other “proactive measures” to reduce meat consumption. Even with such suggestions, the study finds that food prices will increase at least 50 percent by 2050. "
FACTORY FARMING PROTEST,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/factory-farming-protest,"JANUARY 25, 2011","On Saturday, January 22, 2011, the second day of the International Green Week food and agriculture fair, more than 22,000 people demonstrated against factory farming, genetic modification technology, and mass food production in Berlin, Germany. Represented by animal-rights activists, farmers, and food-business organizations, the protest also responded to the recent dioxin scandal that required closing nearly 1,000 farms. “We are fed up” and “We’ve had enough—no to genetic engineering, factory farming, and export dumping” were two mottos protestors chanted. Friends of the Earth, the world’s largest grassroots environmental network, reminded protestors that agricultural decisions made in Europe would have “strong repercussions for those in the developing world.” "
SODEXO’S MEATLESS MONDAY,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/sodexos-meatless-monday,"JANUARY 25, 2011","Sodexo, a premier food services provider that serves 10 million customers daily, is rolling out a new Meatless Monday campaign to hospital, education, government, and corporate clients around the country. Nitu Gupta, vice president of brand management for Sodexo health care, says, “Meatless Monday is a simple thing we can do in the face of multiple challenges. Little changes in our behavior can have a profound effect.” Sodexo is also the manager and operator of Northwestern University’s dining services, which won PETA2’s “Most Vegan-Friendly College in America” award in 2010 for serving such vegan options as seitan tacos, pumpkin chowder, and Thai green curry with tofu.

JACK LALANNE DIES,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/jack-lalanne-dies,"JANUARY 24, 2011","Jack LaLanne, whose workout show was a television staple from 1951 to 1984, died of respiratory failure due to pneumonia on Sunday. LaLanne, who was 96, became interested in fitness as a teenager, and continued to eat well and exercise every day of his life until his death. LaLanne first became famous for his television show, which used only a chair and a towel as exercise equipment, and went on to found a chain of fitness studios bearing his name. His advice still rings true today: “The only way you can hurt the body is not use it,” LaLanne said. “Inactivity is the killer and, remember, it’s never too late.” "
VEGANS ON CUPCAKE WARS,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/vegans-on-cupcake-wars,"JANUARY 23, 2011","After Chloe Coscarelli won season one of Cupcake Wars, vegan bakers are back on season two, represented by Washington, DC-based shop Sticky Fingers Bakery and Los Angeles’ C’est La V Bakeshop. Sticky Fingers co-founder Doron Petersan says the show’s producers had the bakery on their radar, and invited them to apply to be on the show. “Vegan can be just as good if not better. So it was really exciting for us, and we took the opportunity very seriously,” Petersan said. Kim Garr, owner of C’est La V commented that she “was very happy to represent vegans on a mainstream Food Network show.” Cupcake Wars airs on March 8 and will be a competition-filled hour. "
USDA BIO-BASED LABEL,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/usda-bio-based-label,"JANUARY 23, 2011","The U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched a new, voluntary product label for bio-based commercial and industrial products such as cleaners, constructions products, and makeup. The certification, which will begin appearing in the spring, is aimed at notifying consumers of products that are made of soy, corn, or other renewable material that is compostable. Deputy agriculture secretary Kathleen Merrigan stated that this “will make [healthy] decisions easier by identifying products as bio-based.” Products, however, only need to meet a 25-percent level of renewable ingredients to qualify for the USDA label. The program will be similar to the organic labeling process. "
TOO MUCH MERCURY IN FISH,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/too-much-mercury-in-fish,"JANUARY 23, 2011","Got Mercury?, a San Francisco-based public awareness group, recently released results of an undercover fish testing operation, in which they found grocery store-bought fish to contain levels of mercury that exceed the federal limit. More than one-third of the 41 grocery stores Got Mercury? purchased fish from had levels of methylmercury in excess of the federal regulation of one part per million. Swordfish was the worst of the fish they tested—one swordfish purchased in Los Angeles had three parts per million. Some experts believe the alarm is “overblown,” however, citing that mercury levels are not harmful until they reach 10 parts per million. Overexposure to mercury has been proven to cause neurological damage in unborn children and adults. "
INCREASE YOUR VEGAN REACH WITH SOCIAL MEDIA,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/increase-your-vegan-reach-with-social-media,"JANUARY 23, 2011","With tweets getting more attention than press releases, social media is becoming one of the best ways to receive, promote, and share information about veganism. Celebrities are using it to reach huge audiences, but even if your name isn’t written in the stars quite yet, you can show off your culinary prowess, alert people to vegan events and news, or just share opinions and stories in no time with these helpful tips. Blog It
Blogging is usually the first step to having a social media presence. Blog about anything and everything—your delicious breakfast, a great veg book, the next door neighbor’s adorable pup, the latest veg restaurant opening, or anything that strikes your cruelty-free fancy. The key is to blog frequently and consistently, which will attract new readers and keep them loyal. Vegansaurus is an excellent example of an all-things veg blog, where writers post on topics ranging from bakesales to animal testing. You can also distinguish yourself from others by having a unique theme—check out ecorazzi and FatFree Vegan Kitchen for great themed blogs. Get a Face
Facebook is the core of social networking, and having an account will make it easy for people to find you online. Plus, if you’re a budding activist, there’s the added benefit of directly reaching your friends. Michael Parrish DuDell, former senior editor of ecorazzi, promoted his Birthday Activism event via Facebook and had more than 2,200 people participate. Another great thing about Facebook is that you can get instant feedback. Take advantage of it, and engage your readers with giveaways, questions, and surveys. Tweet Talk
Twitter: it’s quick, it’s concise, and it feels like everybody and their mom is on it. But with all the quirks like hashtags and retweets, it can be intimidating for newcomers. Don’t worry—a quick Google search will yield simple explanations. The vegan community is huge on Twitter, with veg restaurants such as Veggie Grill to activists like Your Daily Vegan. With such a large veg presence, Twitter is one of the best platforms for connecting, sharing, and participating with like-minded people.  DIY Broadcasting
When done right, YouTube videos and podcasts can garner devout followers. They also need a bit more technological savvy, so Our Hen House co-founder Jasmin Singer recommends attending One to One sessions at a Mac store, where you can learn all about the tools needed to produce great content. When creating a podcast or video, it’s especially important to keep tone in mind. As Singer says, “being overly didactic is a no-no. Find your niche […] and plan on devoting many hours per week producing each episode.” That’s quite a bit of time, but as the popularity of the Our Hen House podcast proves, it’s time well-spent.  Follow and Be Followed
Today, there’s no better place to see how others succeed and fail than through social media. Paying attention to and keeping up with your favorite vegan social media gurus is key. Take it a step further by participating in discussions, commenting on posts, and retweeting. The more you do this, the more presence and influence you have. Soon enough, you’ll be a go-to vegan source! Other Great Resources and Blogs:

The explosive popularity of hybrid cars has cleared the path for car companies to manufacture greener, more fuel-efficient vehicles. But with so many cars touting their green qualities, it can be confusing for a conscious consumer to find the right ride. Here’s our helpful guide. Electrically Charged
Currently, there are two mass-market electric cars, the Nissan LEAF and the Chevrolet Volt. The Nissan LEAF, while pricey with a price tag of roughly $32,000, boasts major federal tax incentives (which can bring the cost down to $20,000–$25,000 depending on the state), long battery warranties, zero Carbon Dioxide emissions, and it never needs an oil change. It does, however, require eight hours for a full charge, which costs approximately $560 annually. The Chevrolet Volt is not entirely electric with a gas engine that’s used when needed. The Volt can drive 35 miles on a single charge, was named Car of the Year by Motor Trend, and comes with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and as much as $5,000 in state tax credits, again depending on the state. Hybrid
The Toyota Prius still leads the market in hybrid cars with 50 mpg and an estimated price tag of $21,000. Consumer Reports claims that the Prius is a better value than the Nissan Leaf or Chevrolet Volt, even though it takes more gas to fuel. Other hybrids on the market—Ford Fusion (39 mpg), the re-launched Honda Insight (41 mpg), and the Honda Civic Hybrid (41 mpg)—are also gaining in popularity. For a luxury model, the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid is comparable to the Ford Fusion with 39 mpg as well. While still garnering good reviews, these models are less fuel economic than their counterparts—Nissan Altima Hybrid (33 mpg), Toyota Camry Hybrid (33 mpg), and Ford Escape Hybrid (32 mpg). Fuel-Efficient
While none of these cars is a hybrid or electric, they all offer the best miles per gallon compared to other gas-fueled autos. For city drivers, the compact, 41-mpg Smart Fortwo Coupe is a great choice, especially for squeezing into small parking spots. While the restyled Volkswagen Jetta, with a starting price of $16,000, gets 34 mpg, it does produce more emissions than others in its class. A bit pricey than its fuel-efficient counterparts, the luxury Audi A3 hatchback runs on diesel fuel and offers 34 mpg. Vegan Options
The Nissan LEAF comes with partially recycled cloth seat fabric and the Ford Fusion uses 85-percent post-industrial materials for their cloth seats. Toyota exclusively offers non-leather seats for the Prius. There are several cars that come with the option of heated cloth interiors, a particularly alluring option during winter. The BMW (1 and 3 series), Mercedes Benz (C class series), and some Volkswagen models like the Jetta and Routan offer faux-leather seats as a standard option. When asking for fake leather for your car, know your lingo. It might be called leatherette, V-Tex leatherette, MB-Tex (for Mercedes Benz cars), or pleather. Some spots in a car that you might not know contain leather are the steering wheel and gear shift. For car drivers who are environmentally aware, now there are a ton of great options for choosing a car that will lessen our dependency on gasoline. Now what can we do about traffic? "
NEW VEGAN ETSY SHOP,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/new-vegan-etsy-shop,"JANUARY 22, 2011","Our Hen House has opened its brand new shop on Etsy, which currently sells jewelry and knit accessories made by supporters of the nonprofit. “The arts are such an important aspect of advocacy […] at the Our Hen House Etsy shop, shoppers are voting with their dollars to support the work of compassionate artists,” says co-founder Jasmin Singer. All proceeds from the shop go to augment the nonprofit’s multimedia and operational costs. The shop is also always looking for new cruelty-free artists to feature. Our Hen House was founded in 2010 and produces resources on creating positive change for animals. "
VEGANS ON NPR,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/vegans-on-npr,"JANUARY 21, 2011","Beef is no longer what’s for dinner. This week, the NPR radio show On Point with Tom Ashbrook featured some of the country’s most well-known vegans discussing veganism’s quick rise in popularity on the episode “Vegans Take America.” Guests included Isa Chandra Moskowitz, author of the Post Punk Kitchen blog and new book Appetite for Reduction; and Mollie Katzen, best-selling author of Moosewood Cookbook.

WALMART PROMOTES HEALTH,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/walmart-promotes-health,"JANUARY 20, 2011","Yesterday, Walmart announced a five-year plan to reduce unhealthy salts, trans fats, and sugar in its Great Value brand packaged foods. The company will also lower prices on fresh fruit and vegetable. First Lady Michelle Obama, a proponent for healthy eating and reducing childhood obesity, worked with Walmart to develop the plan, and attended the announcement stating that “this charter is a huge victory for folks all across this country.” The initiative also includes commitments to building stores in underserved rural and urban communities where fresh produce is not readily available. Walmart currently has more than 4,000 stores operating nationwide, and accounts for one of every three dollars spent on groceries in the US. "
GEORGIA’S FOOD LAWS,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/georgias-food-laws,"JANUARY 20, 2011","Georgia is one of many states that are now introducing “food freedom” bills in their state legislatures in order to protect small farmers from the increased food safety regulations recently signed into law. The food freedom bills would stop strict governmental regulations on food produced and sold from small sources like bake sales and community potlucks—even a person’s backyard. Georgia specifically has introduced two bills—one calls for the right to grow one’s own food and the other would prohibit any unprocessed produce (tomatoes at a community farmers’ market, for example) from government regulation. These bills are also in response to growing concerns for small farmers—last year a Georgia man was fined $5,000 for growing too many vegetables on his own property. "
PROTESTERS FACE LIBEL,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/protesters-face-libel,"JANUARY 20, 2011","A group of environmental and animal-welfare groups led by the Soil Association, an organic farming group, are being threatened with libel for protesting a potential pig farm in Foston, Deryshire, in central England. The protesters say the 25,000 plus pigs would risk promoting diseases that could be passed to humans, such as salmonella and meningitis. A group of libel lawyers from the firm Carter-Ruck wrote a letter to the protestors, warning against “misconceived and formulaic allegations” and threatening a costly lawsuit. This attempt is the latest in a series that use libel laws to quiet the critics of large commercial companies—the only way someone can be sued for libel is if they publicly lie recklessly or deliberately about a person or persons. "
CRUEL FISH SLAUGHTER,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/cruel-fish-slaughter,"JANUARY 19, 2011","As a result of an undercover investigation, Mercy for Animals (MFA) has released a new video that provides a glimpse into “Catfish Corner,” a fish slaughtering facility. The video captures workers pulling skin and tearing heads off of live fish, dozens of fish crammed into buckets, and fish being left out of water to suffocate. MFA has made complaints to the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office on the basis of cruelty to animals, but the DA’s Office has declined to file charges. Approximately 8.4 billion fish are killed each year for food in the US, with Texas being a leading producer of farm-raised catfish. "
VEGAN CONVENIENCE STORE,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/vegan-convenience-store,"JANUARY 19, 2011","Vegan Freak, a 100-percent vegan specialty and convenience store, opened January 12 in the town of Denton, Texas, about an hour’s drive north of Dallas. Abbey Autry and Brendan Carroll opened Vegan Freak in order to provide their community with reasonably priced, environmentally friendly, and cruelty-free products—what Autry calls “a truly guilt-free shopping experience.” Some of the store’s goods include cosmetics, cleaning products, snacks, sweets, and specialty vegan items—even faux-leather sports balls are available. Autry and Carroll have both been vegan for years—the store’s opening day was Autry’s 11-year anniversary with veganism. "
FARM ANIMAL INITIATIVE,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/farm-animal-initiative,"JANUARY 19, 2011","Washingtonians for Humane Farms, backed by The Humane Society of the United States, is working to place a new measure to prohibit crammed living spaces for egg-laying hens on the upcoming Washington state ballot. Known as the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, the initiative prohibits cruel confinement of hens who are housed in stacked cages or in a manner that prevents them from freely turning, lying down, stretching, or standing up. The act would also outlaw the sale of eggs from confined hens. Around six million hens in Washington are currently housed in battery cages where they can move no more than an inch. "
VEGAN SILVERSTONE PREGNANT,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/vegan-silverstone-pregnant,"JANUARY 18, 2011","Alicia Silverstone—actress, author, animal-rights activist and VN contributor—announced late last week that she and her husband Christopher are expecting a child later this year. Silverstone posted the news on her blog, The Kind Life, along with the announcement that she will be sharing her experiences and other information about vegan pregnancy on the site. “I’m excited about documenting this time in my life, and sharing all of my experiences with you,” she writes on her blog. “I will definitely be posting tons more blogs about pregnancy, and can’t wait to hear your feedback.” This will prove a very busy year for the actress, who also has three films—Vamps, Butter, and Homework—premiering in 2011. "
INDUSTRIAL FARMVILLE,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/industrial-farmville,"JANUARY 18, 2011","With more than 53 million active users, Facebook’s Farmville game may be a metaphor for the death of small, family farming, says The Atlantic writer David Thier. In order to earn coins and succeed at Farmville, users purchase machinery such as tractors, harvesters, seeders, combines, and biplanes. In his article, Thier writes he eventually “was cramming [his] animals into confined animal feeding operations so tight that the cow heads popped comically and tragically out of the second floor.” The game may promote industrial farming, even when, as Worldwatch Institute recently reported, local, small-scale agriculture is the healthiest and most sustainable solution to the world’s food needs. "
ANIMAL-FREE VEGAN WINTER FASHION,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/animal-free-vegan-winter-fashion,"JANUARY 18, 2011","This time of year, when most of the country is blanketed in snow and even walking around the house requires a scarf and parka, you might feel that you need to sacrifice fashion for warmth. Thanks to slews of designers and retailers offering cruelty-free threads, you can find clothes that are cozy, chic, and (most importantly!) animal-friendly. With all of the wonderful alternatives to winter staples like wool, cashmere, and leather, you can be warm, comfortable, and au courant throughout the winter months in these stylish picks. Out of the Arctic Outerwear
Goose down jackets and wool coats don’t hold a candle to this year’s haul of vegan-friendly outerwear. Patagonia uses organic cotton and recycled polyester in many of their men’s jackets—for a more classic look, try Vaute Couture’s handsome black pea coat. Ladies have myriad options when it comes to overcoats—Madewell’s 100-percent cotton, military-inspired parka is perfect for the everyday, while Kate Spade’s houndstooth cotton coat is a lovely choice for evening. Need something lighter? Anthropologie’s blazer is great for the office and when paired with skinny jeans for a night out. Not Your Grandma’s Homemade Sweater
Sweaters are a cold-weather staple but can be a challenge when avoiding cashmere. Fortunately, we’ve found a laundry hamper full of cruelty-free options. For men, J. Crew makes the classic sailor stripe sweater in thick, warm cotton, and B:Scott has a button-down sweater that will make an understated statement in any situation. Ladies won’t sacrifice style or warmth in Gap’s biker-chic cardigan. Don’t worry if you’re jealous of the men’s J. Crew sweater—they have one for ladies too. Alpine-Friendly Accessories
Scarves, hats, and gloves look good all year—but they’re downright essential in winter. Thick cable-knit and reversible patterned scarves for men and a grey cable-knit beanie and cap with an oversized pompom for ladies are just the tip of the iceberg at ASOS. Urban Outfitters makes it easy for vegan guys to keep their noggins toasty—a marled knit cap with earflaps is just one of many options. Women can wrap up in Shock Boutique’s pocket-adorned scarf or in this fine-knit silver snood from Topshop. Cold hands will stay warm (and look great) in faux fur-trimmed mittens or rust-colored palm warmers, both from Topshop. For the guys, REI makes fleece convertible gloves that can turn into mittens in a snap—perfect for texting during a chilly commute. Warm and Fuzzy Feet
Vegans can keep their feet warm this season (without five extra pairs of socks!) with numerous animal-free options. Men’s toes will stay toasty while running errands in faux shearling-lined lace-up boots from Loomstate or in high tops from Keep. No need to wear leather kicks for business meetings and evenings out—Italian vegan shoe designer Noah makes many beautiful dress shoes for men and impossibly chic riding boots for women. Speaking of vegan shoes, Olsen Haus’ faux-suede heels and Wanted’s faux-leather biker boots are stylish picks for ladies. These dashing options will keep you toasty and warm until spring arrives. Here’s to fireside cups of hot cocoa, sledding, and vegan snow angels! "
WALGREENS OFFERS FRESH FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/walgreens-offers-fresh-food,"JANUARY 17, 2011","Walgreens announced Friday that it plans to expand its fresh food program to more than 400 stores in many of the country’s “food deserts”—areas that lack supermarkets and access to fresh foods. The offerings, which include fruits, vegetables, and other items such as beer and wine, are part of the company’s strategy to become a more convenient, one-stop shop for healthy living. The company also hopes the expansion will strengthen their plan to become a larger provider of healthcare services—Walgreens is the second-largest US provider of flu shots after the US government. "

HOW MUSHROOMS KEEP YOU HEALTHY,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/how-mushrooms-keep-you-healthy,"JANUARY 16, 2011","Want to improve your health and enjoy some delicious food? Then pile on the mushrooms. Not only are they so desirable that people will hunt for hours to find rare ones and spend hundreds on a single ounce, ancient Chinese medicine has also been using them for thousands of years to prevent and cure numerous diseases. What’s more, they’re rich in umami—the uniquely savory fifth taste—without the sodium or MSG. And with around 14,000 varieties, mushroom flavors and benefits range from delicate to pungent, flu fighting to asthma reducing. So if you haven’t already, fight off winter colds by adding one, or all, of these mighty fungi to your plate.  Button and Portobello: Don’t dismiss these common mushrooms; the button and portobello varieties enhance your immune system’s natural killer-cell activity to prevent the flu and provide a healthy dose of antioxidants and B vitamins. Plus, they’re inexpensive and easy to cook. Try out some seriously good Portobello Burgers or make simple Marinated Mushrooms for your next meal. Chanterelles: Prized by chefs worldwide, these golden goodies offer a delicate flavor perfect in dishes like Squash With Wild Rice and Chanterelle Stuffing and Spicy Chanterelle Tofu Scramble. And if you’re interested in mushroom hunting, try looking at the base of oak, Douglas fir, and western hemlock trees, where chanterelles grow in a symbiotic relationship with the trees. Reishi: One of the most commonly used mushrooms in Chinese herbal medicine, the reishi is available in syrup, tea, soup, and pill form. Especially beneficial for lung and liver health, this healing mushroom can also be used as a mood and spirit booster—perfect for dark, wintery days. Morels: Their rich flavor make morels a prized food in French cuisine and a perfect meat substitute in savory dishes such as Wild and Walnutty Mushroom “Sausage” Pizza. Just remember to cook these honeycomb-like caps thoroughly, since some have low levels of toxins that cause gastrointestinal problems when eaten raw. Truffles: The ultimate delicacy, rare truffles sell for thousands of dollars per ounce. Luckily for us non-millionaires out there, delicious Oregon truffles can be bought for around $20 a pop. Get your five-star chef on and awe all your foodie friends with Black Truffle Bowtie Pasta Salad or Onion Soup Gratineéd with Cream-Truffle Mashed Potatoes. Maitake: Known as the King of Mushrooms, this medicinal species does it all—fights tumors, restores the immune system, increases production of proteins responsible for fighting infection, promotes healthy digestion… the list goes on! Reap the benefits and add maitake mushrooms to a hearty dish such as Creamy Pumpkin-Mushroom Casserole. Shiitake: An all-time favorite mushroom in Asian cuisine, try warming your belly up with some Congee or Mushroom Miso Soup. Shiitake extract also contains lentinan, a powerful immune boosting compound, which has also been shown to delay the progress of viruses by increasing antibody levels. Oyster: These babies are the most aggressive species, growing in giant clusters with their caps at up to twelve inches in diameter. Studies have also revealed that they lower unhealthy cholesterol and have anti-cancer properties. Eat them in a delicious soup or sauté such as Vegan Clam-less Chowder or Oyster Mushroom Stir Fry. "
ARRESTS OVER TAINTED MILK,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/arrests-over-tainted-milk,"JANUARY 15, 2011","In the latest crackdown to root out melamine-tainted dairy, Chinese authorities arrested 96 people found producing and selling dairy products with tainted milk powder. The powder was leftover from the 2008 melamine-tainted milk scare that killed six infants and sickened more than 300,000 people. Authorities confiscated and destroyed 2,132 tons of milk powder containing melamine, an industrial chemical used to make plastic, since last July, and more than 25,000 tons in 2010. The Food Safety Committee Office of the State has promised to clean up the industry. "
LUNCH STANDARDS RAISED,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/lunch-standards-raised,"JANUARY 14, 2011","In an effort to combat childhood obesity and promote a healthful lifestyle, the USDA is calling for higher standards for school lunches. The USDA’s aim is to reduce the amount of trans fat, sodium, and calories in school meals. The proposal calls for one serving of fruit and two servings of vegetables each day and for the first time requires that half of the grains served be whole grains. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says, “With many children consuming as many as half their daily calories at school, strengthening nutritional standards is an important step in the Obama administration’s effort to combat childhood obesity and improve the health and well-being of our kids.” "

BARILLA GOES CAGE-FREE,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/barilla-goes-cage-free,"JANUARY 13, 2011","The world’s largest pasta making company, Chicago-based Barilla, is the first in its industry to join the cage-free movement. Barilla is committed to using cage-free for 45 percent of its eggs in 2011. In a letter to The Humane Society of the United States, the company wrote that its policy is to “take into consideration not only the health and wellbeing of people, but also the health and wellbeing of animals.” So far, other major companies that have made the transition into using cage-free eggs include Kraft, Sara Lee, Burger King, Subway, Denny’s, and Costco.

VEG DOCS CLEAN BEEF FAT,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/veg-docs-clean-beef-fat,"JANUARY 13, 2011","The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) has offered to help clean up the beef fat spill in Houston, Texas, in exchange for a sign that reads, “Clean up your arteries. Go vegan.” In her letter to the shipping company, Susan Levin, PCRM’s director of nutrition education, writes, “Just as the 15,000 gallons of beef fat have shut down this major waterway, animal fat in our diets clogs our arteries.” The beef fat spill shut down nearly a mile of one of the nation’s busiest ship channels and took two days to clean up. Levin says the ad would help the residents of Houston recognize the benefits of a vegan diet. Houston is the ninth fattest city in America, according to Men’s Health magazine. "
HUGE HAMBURGER MEAT RECALL,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/huge-hamburger-meat-recall,"JANUARY 13, 2011","The USDA recalled more than 200,000 pounds of frozen beef that was sent to California and Oregon prisons when institution inspectors complained of discoloration and off-odor. A Food Safety and Inspection Service review of New Jersey-based One Great Burger found evidence that the company redistributed returned meat after repackaging and recoding it. The meat was produced between January 2010 and May 2010, but had labeled “packed on” dates between July and November. Even after the recall, One Great Burger is rated at the USDA’s highest level of food safety. "
CHIPOTLE’S VEGAN OPTIONS,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/chipotles-vegan-options,"JANUARY 12, 2011","It is now even easier for Chicago-area vegans to eat at Chipotle Mexican Grill. Earlier this week, Chipotle restaurants throughout the Chicago metropolitan area added posole to their menus. Chipotle’s posole—a popular Mexican soup traditionally made with meat—is vegan, with a base of tomato, hominy, vegetables, and spices. Posole is the first soup to be offered by the popular fast-food restaurant, but not Chiptole’s first effort at vegan cuisine. Many locations offer Garden Blend, a faux meat, for its burritos, tacos, and salad bowls. Chipotle is the winner of this year’s peta2 Libby Award for Most Vegan-Friendly Restaurant Chain.

PIGS BURIED ALIVE,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/pigs-buried-alive,"JANUARY 12, 2011","In response to South Korea’s worst outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), the government has ordered the killing of more than one million pigs—plus hundreds of thousands of cattle, goats, and deer—over the past 40 days. While a cheaper, simpler vaccine could prevent FMD from spreading, the government so far refuses to vaccinate the animals and has lost close to seven percent of its livestock. South Korea is a member of The World Organization for Animal Health, but many animal-rights groups have come forward stating that these recent events are against the organizations’ guidelines. To help stop the slaughter, people can send a letter to ambassador Han Duk-soo. "

Veguary, or “Vegetarian February,” began in 2010 when three classmates realized that eliminating meat consumption is an effective way to give individuals the power to “confront several prevalent problems in our world” such as obesity, global warming, and inhumane treatment of animals. Veguary’s website offers tips, recipes, and an “Ask a Veg” column for those who sign the Veguary pledge. People from more than 30 states have signed up to participate in Veguary 2011; the organizers are hoping to reach all 50 by the time Veguary begins on February 1. "

TAIWAN DOG EATING PROTEST,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/taiwan-dog-eating-protest,"JANUARY 11, 2011","After prosecutors chose not to indict five people who killed and ate two dogs, the Life Caring and Animal Rescue Organization Taiwan (LCO) mobilized hundreds of people in front of the Taiwanese Presidential Office to protest the decision. Last May, the LCO filed charges against the five who had hanged and cooked the dogs. Prosecutors dropped charges because this was a first-time offense and the group did not torture but “only killed [the dogs] for food”. The LCO is now demanding increased animal welfare laws. Selling and consuming dog meat was banned in Taiwan in 2001, but roughly 5,000 dogs are still butchered per year. "

CARROTS MAKE YOU CUTER,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/carrots-make-you-cuter,"JANUARY 10, 2011","No carrot a day might keep the suitors away. Researchers at St Andrews and Bristol universities found that people with a slightly yellow skin hue are considered more healthy and attractive. The study reported that in only two months, increased consumption of carotenoids—yellow pigments found in produce like carrots and plums—led to yellower skin in Caucasian faces. The yellower faces were found by test subjects to be more physically appealing. Ian Stephen, one of the scientists involved in the study, which will be published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior in March, said the link might result in new strategies for persuading young people to eat more produce. "
MEAT IS NEVER OK,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/meat-is-never-ok,"JANUARY 10, 2011","Yesterday, The Atlantic published an article by James McWilliams on why eating meat, even when it is sustainably farmed, is not OK. The history professor explains that while free-range animal agriculture is better than factory farming, it does not address the fundamental issue that animals, like humans, are sentient beings and experience suffering. He suggests that the free-range versus industrial debate is based on viewing animals as property, but if we were to consider animals as equals, it would force people to ask radically different questions. McWilliams is also the author of Just Food: Where Locavores Get It Wrong and How We Can Truly Eat Responsibly, in which he promotes eating less meat. "

Jaap Korteweg, one of the shop’s owners and an eighth-generation lupin seed farmer, opened the store to provide a protein-rich, sustainable alternative to meat while reducing the environmental impact of the extensive soy industry in South America. Products available at De Vegetarische Slager include traditional meat-free options such as BBQ tofu and quinoa, as well as the shop’s own brand of lupin products like croquettes and sandwich patties. Lupin is a legume native to the Mediterranean region and similar in taste to a fava bean. "
BEASTIE BOY BEATS CANCER,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/beastie-boy-beats-cancer,"JANUARY 9, 2011","After adopting a vegan diet post-surgery, Adam Yaunch, also known as MCA of the Beastie Boys, has announced he is now cancer-free. Yaunch was diagnosed with salivary gland cancer in 2009, and underwent surgery and radiation in August. He recently returned from India where he attended a three-day teaching given by the Dalai Lama, and “at the recommendation of the Tibetan doctors [has] been eating a vegan/organic diet” and taking herbal medicine. Fellow Beastie Boys member Mike D announced the good news on BBC radio, stating that the group was very happy and that fans should expect new music from them soon. "
2011 ACTIVISM RESOLUTIONS,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/2011-activism-resolutions,"JANUARY 9, 2011","Sure, the standby resolutions like quitting smoking, losing weight, or cutting back on your drinking (and we don‘t mean water) are classics for a reason: they all reflect our desires to be slightly better in the coming year than we have been in the past. While there‘s nothing wrong with making an effort to shape up, why not extend your resolution repertoire into the activist realm? Here are a few of our favorite, fail-proof ways to help animals, make yourself a better person, and lose weight. Well, OK, you‘ll at least be helping animals! Book Smart
Start a book club. No, you don‘t have to take up knitting, too, or slap a cozy on your teapot while you talk literature. It‘s up to individuals to bring important books like those read in our very own VegNews Book Club and countless others into the living rooms of our friends and neighbors. Don‘t forget to bake vegan goodies to share while you discuss some of the most important topics of our times. Green Acres
Donate your time. If you agree with all of the reasons to adopt a veg lifestyle but lack the motivation to take the next step and promote your veg ethics, you may benefit from allowing yourself to get emotionally charged. The best way to get activated is to volunteer some time at a farm sanctuary. Getting to know the animals who would otherwise be exploited and killed for their meat and other body parts will surely stir up the activism that‘s been dormant until now. Find a sanctuary near you by logging on to farmanimalshelters.org. Think Locally
Get active in local politics. For the newbie, a good way to dip one‘s toes into the political pond is to get a resolution passed in your town condemning battery-cage eggs. If the entire state of California can take a stance against the cruel practice of confining egg-laying hens—as it recently did in passing Prop. 2—so can your town. This is a great way to make a statement that will likely generate local support, and requires no sacrifice on the part of the town council—just a signature. While it won‘t directly or immediately affect change for chickens, it will likely cause a ripple effect that will get your local politicos and neighbors thinking about animal issues. Help Humanity
Get active—for human rights! Vegetarians are often accused of being a special-interest group that only cares about animal issues. Even if you‘re just making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and handing them out to homeless people on your own, each sandwich is a meatless meal for someone who would have otherwise gone without. For a more organized approach, get involved with your local chapter of Food Not Bombs, a nationwide network of volunteer-run groups who serve vegetarian meals to the homeless, or Compassion Over Killing, whose website has instructions for hosting a “feed-in.” "
HOT APPLE CIDER TEA,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/hot-apple-cider-tea,"JANUARY 9, 2011","With the weather cooling down it’s imperative to have delicious teas on hand at all times. The Republic of Tea offers a number of exciting elixirs, and we particularly liked the Hot Apple Cider flavor. Of course, it doesn’t brew up as strongly as actual apple cider, which means it makes a refreshing respite from all the overly sweet pumpkin lattes and peppermint hot cocoas that flood our kitchens this time of year.

VEG DIET FOR HEART HEALTH,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/veg-diet-for-heart-health,"JANUARY 8, 2011","A study conducted at the Cancer Research and Prevention Institute in Florence found that women who ate at least one serving of leafy vegetables daily—such as kale or spinach—were more than 40 percent less likely to develop heart disease relative to those who ate two or fewer servings each week. Additionally, women who ate three or more tablespoons of olive oil weekly were 40 percent less likely to be diagnosed with heart disease, compared to women who ingested only one tablespoon. Researchers believe antioxidants and micronutrients such as folate present in leafy vegetables and olive oil might contribute to heart health. People living the Mediterranean region have long been touted as having one of the healthiest diets in the world. "

SOY STOPS PROSTATE CANCER,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/soy-stops-prostate-cancer,"JANUARY 6, 2011","Soy could be the solution to cure and prevent prostate cancer (PCa). Genistein, a natural substance found in soy, inhibits prostate cancer cells from metastasizing, say researchers from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. In a recent study led by Raymond Bergan, MD, 38 men with localized PCa were given genistein pills for a month before surgery. Post-surgery examinations showed a significant increase of genes that suppress cancer cells, and decreased expression of genes that enhance cancer cells. Previous studies also indicate that men who eat soy are 30 percent less likely to develop PCa. Soy comes in many forms, including tofu, edamame, and tempeh. "
VEGAN DIET GOES MAINSTREAM,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/vegan-diet-goes-mainstream,"JANUARY 6, 2011","This week, The Washington Post published an article noting veganism’s rise in popularity, due to concerns over food safety, the environment, and personal health. Veganism’s move to the mainstream can be seen in supermarket aisles stocking tofu and tempeh, as well as in school lunches—just this year, Hawaii, California, New York, and Florida legislatures passed resolutions asking for vegan options. In addition, more and more books like Skinny Bitch and Alicia Silverstone’s The Kind Diet are ending up on best-seller lists. Veganism is gaining support from celebrities as well—heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson and Glee star Lea Michele both promote their choice for a plant-based diet. "
VEG DIET MAY AFFECT SEX OF BABY,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/veg-diet-may-affect-sex-of-baby,"JANUARY 5, 2011","A new Dutch study reports that diet could be a contributing factor in determining a baby’s sex. The study, conducted by Gender Consult along with Delft and Maastricht Universities, asked 32 women who had given birth to boys to eat a diet high in calcium and magnesium, including foods such as spinach and black beans. Over a five-year period, 26 of the women gave birth to girls while only six had boys. The researchers believe mineral levels in the mother’s blood render the unfertilized egg more receptive to female chromosomes. Annet Norlander, a biologist at the center, said the results are significant for those wishing to influence the sex of their child. "

Radha Yoga & Eatery
Ascend Radha’s staircase entrance off unassuming Main Street in Vancouver’s downtown eastside, and you’ll be drawn into the dazzling serenity and aroma of Radha Yoga & Eatery, a yoga studio by day and vegan restaurant by night. The room features an attractive bar, local art, a stage for the occasional event or concert, and tasteful décor—all constructed with the environment in mind. In 2009, Radha closed its doors for several months to undergo green renovations that include an air-source heat pump, solar light tubes, LED and fluorescent dimmable lights, and a green roof. Continuing the eco-conscious theme, Radha sources as many of its ingredients as possible from local organic farms that then become the inspiration for its rotating menus. Remove all the tables, and you have what is possibly one of the most stunning studios in yoga-crazy Vancouver. Though it’s easy to be distracted by Radha’s tempting food menus, the restaurant and yoga studio are in operation as a non-profit organization, and Radha offers reflective and gentle styles of yoga to build your appetite mindfully. The classes are all available in a community-driven “pay-as-you-can” philosophy, with your usual hatha yoga classes on the schedule among more esoteric classes such as dream yoga, kundalini, and “Hidden Language Hatha Yoga.” Also spreading word of the plant-based diet are Radha’s regular cooking classes, which offer everything from fermented foods and beverages, Indian cooking, and seasonal soups, to alternative baking, canapés, and hors d’oeuvres. The yoga studio environment need not deter diners who are skeptical about outright yogic dogma. There are no guidelines condemning the consumption of alcohol (Radha offers a full wine and beer list focused on organic selections, as well as unique cocktails made from unconventional ingredients such as fresh juices and housemade kombucha) nor the consumption of garlic and onions. The way to get the most out of Radha’s various options is through the $29.50 three-course tasting menu, which, in terms of value, puts the typical set menus at other locavore restaurants to shame. Appetizers such as sunchoke and artichoke blinis with Brussels sprouts sauté and an apple-wine reduction, warm roasted crimini mushroom and beet salad over kale and chard, and a raw cashew cheese plate served with seed crackers welcome you into the space while you ponder your entrée selection and soak in the atmosphere. For the second course, the a la carte menu offers a quinoa-nut burger, kamut pizza with seasonal pesto and toppings, a raw-food special of the day, and a nourishing grain bowl. The winter menu features a Tuscan Bean Stew with rosemary, thyme, and roasted vegetables, Butternut Agnolotti pasta filled with butternut squash and hazelnut filling and a garlic-sage aioli, and Lapsang Portobello—mushrooms marinated in pine-smoked tea, served with a red quinoa and cranberry pilaf with root vegetables and sautéed greens. These classy offerings double as works of art that will warm omnivores to the idea of going veg. If you haven’t been convinced by the savory delicacies, consider the patriotic Canadian Baklava (spelt phyllo pastry layered with maple syrup and hazelnut filling), raw chocolate torte (rich and dense chocolate ganache with a nut and seed crust and a berry coulis), or apple crumble (cinnamon- and nutmeg-spiced filling topped with oat and nut crust, served with vanilla ice cream). For post-dessert libations, Radha recommends Liquid Raspberry Heaven, organic and vegan raspberry liqueur made by the local Elephant Island winery in Naramata Beach, BC. For those on a budget looking for a warming bowl of food and as a nod from Radha to the less-affluent downtown eastside, the menu includes a pay-what-you-can Community Dhal—spicy and hearty red lentil soup that doesn’t taste like financial compromise. Committed to the environment, community, health, and producing upscale vegan food, Radha offers a perfect blend of food and fitness. —GP Big Apple Bites
Terri
Could 620 square feet of prime New York real estate be transformed into a mecca of vegan goodness? The answer is undoubtedly absolutely. Terri, an all-vegan restaurant located the heart of Chelsea, proves you need not possess a big space to provide your guests with big flavor. With menu offerings such as a Bacon Cheddar Chicken Ranch sandwich, Chickpea “Tuna” Melt, and Caesar Salad, this little restaurant-that-could is the perfect place for a satisfying, on-the-go meal. What’s more, with gluten-free bread and tortillas available by request, even the gluten-intolerant among us have a place to call home. But Terri isn’t exclusively for fans of vegan comfort food. Located next to the New York Health and Racquet Club, this haven of herbivore happiness offers plenty of healthy fare fit for even the most fanatical workout lover. With fewer than 250 calories, the Green Power Smoothie—consisting of kale, pear, banana, almond butter, and your choice of either soy or almond milk—is a great way to get your greens while refueling after a strenuous workout. Oh, and it’s also decidedly delicious. Craving something mightier than a power smoothie? For some hearty, low-fat plant-based protein, try the meatball sub with marinara sauce and Daiya cheese. Each homemade meatball contains less than one gram of fat and will leave you fully satisfied without the usual after-effect stomachache of an overloaded sub. Prices at Terri are low to help further its mission of making vegan food accessible. “I wanted to create a restaurant that made it possible for everyone to have access to vegan options,” reveals Terri Co-owner Craig Cochran. With sandwiches and wraps averaging $8 and salads less than $7, menu items are only about 50 cents more than those at the neighboring fast-food giant Chipotle restaurant. With a noble goal and a scrumptious concept, one might say Cochran started Terri thanks to a twist of fate. The longtime vegan had been managing another popular New York vegetarian restaurant when a regular customer mentioned he was looking for a new healthy eatery to occupy an empty space. Turns out, the customer was Jed Manocherian—a well-known New York City developer and passionate vegan. In fact, so serious is Manocherian about his plant-based lifestyle, he’s included a clause in the contract stating that if Terri were to move out, the space must be occupied by a vegan company. It doesn’t, thankfully, look as if Terri will be going anywhere soon. As a steady flow of hungry customers fill the bright and welcoming hot spot, one can only imagine that great things are in store for this charming new Manhattan eatery. —MPDD Eating more healthfully this time of year is only natural, and restaurants like Radha and Terri have nailed the combination of vibrant food and active bodies. Here’s to a healthy year for all! "

In late 2010, Clinton confirmed that he was following a vegan diet as an experiment to cure heart problems and lose weight. Now the former president says he lives on beans, legumes, vegetables, fruit—and drinks a protein supplement every morning made with almond milk. Previous PETA Person of the Year winners include Ellen DeGeneres, Oprah Winfrey, Stella McCartney, and former Senator Robert C. Byrd. "

NEW YEAR TRADITIONS FROM AROUND THE WORLD,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/new-year-traditions-from-around-the-world,"JANUARY 2, 2011","Depending on your religious and cultural heritage, the new year may be celebrated anytime between January and December. Often tied to the reaping of the harvest and the planting of new crops, plant-based foods play a significant role in celebrations around the world. Whether hosting a New Year’s Eve party at home or spending the evening with a few close friends, incorporating these fun seasonal customs can offer new perspectives to reenergize the holiday. Here are a few global traditions to ring in the new year, veggie-style. Hide & Seek
In many cultures, it’s custom to conceal a token inside bread or a dessert, ensuring prosperity in the coming year to the person who finds it. Armenians bake a coin into their traditional flat bread, Italians hide a bean in their Torta della Befana, and Greeks serve Vassilopitta with a coin tucked inside. Scandinavians stir an almond into their rice pudding. Try borrowing this cultural custom to wish good luck and prosperity upon your friends and family this year by hiding a token in some yummy vegan cupcakes—as if anyone needed another excuse to devour them. And Then There Were None
The Spanish “good luck” ritual to eat 12 grapes at midnight—one each time the clock chimes—is shared by the people of Portugal, Mexico, and the Philippines. In Peru, the same custom is practiced, but a 13th grape is eaten for good measure. Consuming grapes instead of champagne at midnight is certainly a healthier cultural tradition! Splish Splash
A water festival is a common New Year’s tradition in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. Symbolizing renewal, the water is usually colored pink, red, or yellow to signify the hope for a “colorful future.” Give this tradition a nod by decorating your New Year’s party with floating candles in bowls of colored water. Guests will “ooo” and “ahh” at your knack for décor! Spill the Beans
Legumes serve as a symbol of good luck in many countries’ festivities. In Italy, it’s believed that eating lentils will bring good fortune all year long. In Argentina, eating beans signifies you will keep your job or find a better one. In the southern US, black-eyed peas and turnip greens represent coins and dollars. To incorporate this tradition into a holiday party, simply center the menu around legume, lentil, and bean dishes. For the Animals
Although the Buddhist custom of releasing captive animals in East and Southeast Asia is rarely practiced in modern times, it’s a New Year’s ritual borne out of compassion. In Poland, homemade animal-shaped breads symbolize good fortune and are given away as gifts to friends and family. "
HSUS LETTER TO MCDONALD’S,https://vegnews.com/2011/1/hsus-letter-to-mcdonalds,"JANUARY 1, 2011","The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) has submitted a shareholder resolution to fast-food giant McDonald’s, asking that the McDonald’s franchises begin making the transition to cage-free eggs, on both ethical and safety grounds. Currently, all of the US McDonald’s restaurants use only eggs from caged hens, though all of the English franchises are cage-free, and the European Union (EU) franchises are soon to follow by the end of the year. “Piling hens into cages so small the birds can’t even extend their wings, is both an animal welfare and food safety threat,” said Dr. Michael Greger, the director of public health and animal agriculture for the HSUS. “It’s time for the McDonald’s to follow the lead of major companies and phase-in cage-free eggs, which are better for animals and safer for consumers.” "

Maryn McKenna reported on her Wired.com blog, Superbug, that excessive antibiotic use is a concern “because [antibiotic] use stimulates the emergence of drug-resistant organisms that move off the farm in animals, in groundwater, in dust, on the wind and in the systems and on the clothes of those who work there, and makes new resistance factors available to be swapped among bacteria.” The animal resistance to antibiotics can cause health complications in human consumers.

10 WAYS TO GIVE BACK AT THE HOLIDAYS,https://vegnews.com/2010/12/10-ways-to-give-back-at-the-holidays,"DECEMBER 21, 2010","As humans, we derive immense pleasure from the presence of animals in our lives—enjoying birds in our yard, spotting a deer in the woods, or simply being greeted by our beloved dogs, cats, and bunnies with whom we share our homes. Though the animals need our help year-round, the season of giving offers the perfect time to give something back to fellow earth-dwellers. It’s easy to get caught up in the consumerism that inevitably accompany the holidays, but the best gift that one can give is showing love, compassion, and appreciation for those around us. Here are VN’s top 10 ways to have a happier holiday by helping those in need.

1. Support local animal shelters
Shelters need hands-on support as much as they need money. If you can’t foster an animal, consider socializing them at shelters to increase their chances of being adopted.

2. Give the gift of companionship
Studies show that caring for an animal benefits one’s health and decreases depression and blood pressure. Visit senior citizen homes and hospitals, bringing dogs and cats specifically trained for these environments. 3. Teach children kindness
Spend time with children making food for outdoor critters during the cold winter months. Strings of popcorn or peanut butter spread on apples and rolled in birdseed make wonderful projects and nutritious food for animals. 4. Offer animal-sitting services
If you notice your neighbor’s dog is alone all day, offer to walk him or her. Give an animal-sitting coupon to a friend or neighbor as a holiday gift.

5. Plan a volunteer vacation
Many animal organizations around the world offer internship and volunteer opportunities, often providing room and board in exchange. Check out Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Utah or Farm Sanctuary in New York or California for US-based options. 6. Be prepared
Prepare an animal-rescue kit complete with gloves, a box, a blanket, a leash, and treats. If you ever see an animal in need of assistance, you’ll be able to act quickly.

7. Create a backyard wildlife refuge
If your yard is a source of food and water, and a safe place for animals to raise their young, you’re already doing it. You can even become an official refuge by being certified by the National Wildlife Federation. 8. Make play time a priority
Our companion animals crave love and attention, especially if we work outside the house all day long. Schedule play time and regular walks to keep them happy and healthy. 9. Bake vegan goodies
“If it tastes good, they’ll eat it,” is a mantra we love. Help farmed animals by demystifying vegan desserts for your human cohorts. Give baked goods as gifts to friends, family, co-workers, neighbors-everyone!

10. Leave them alone
Probably the best way to help non-human animals is to leave them be. Make choices in your life that do not interfere with, exploit, or harm animals and their habitats. "

Trillions of fish are caught and killed each year through methods such as impaling, clubbing, or forced suffocation, and yet they are mostly unprotected by animal-welfare laws. Braithwaite is one of the leading scientists studying pain in fish. "

BEST BOOKS OF 2010,https://vegnews.com/2010/12/best-books-of-2010,"DECEMBER 6, 2010","This year proved outstanding for intelligently designed and thought-provoking additions to the growing body of literature that point us in the direction of a vegan ideal, while further blurring the line between “us” and “them.” The following 10 books, published between November 2009 and October 2010, made the biggest splash, touching on subjects from factory farming and food politics to both the emotions and morals of companion and wild animals. Of course your opinions may vary. If the book that most opened your eyes in the past 12 months is missing, leave a comment below with the title and author. Animal Camp by Kathy Stevens
The second book by Catskill Animal Sanctuary’s founder is a stocking stuffer for sure, a light read that still packs punch with wonderfully heartwarming and entertaining stories of the lucky animals who found refuge in Upstate New York. Gristle edited by Moby and Miyun Park
Ten essays deal with 10 problems of factory farming. An eye-opener, Gristle expands the argument for a veg planet beyond ethics, health, and global warming. Meat is for Pussies by John Joseph
This testosterone-filled version of Skinny Bitch is the male meatless manifesto. In the year of the vegan man, Joseph pushed the envelope further than any. The New Good Life by John Robbins
The acclaimed author offers a semi-autobiographical account of his financial losses due to the Bernie Madoff scandal, then segues into a how-to guide to living better with less during the current global economic downturn—or anytime. On a Dollar a Day: One Couple’s Unexpected Adventures in Eating in America by Christopher Greenslate and Kerri Leonard
A young San Diego couple experiments with nourishing themselves each day on far less than a cup o’ Starbucks. An interesting and informative quick read. Second Nature by Jonathan Balcombe, PhD
Along with Wild Justice (below), Balcombe’s Second Nature adds to the building tsunami of scholarly science which leaves those who insist that animals don’t possess emotions in the same club as those of think evolution is a theory. The Sexual Politics of Meat (20th Anniversary Edition) by Carol J. Adams
Since it turned 20 in 2010, and was re-released, this book belongs on any Top 10 list. Adams’ magnum opus not only ages well, it gets better and more relevant with the passage of time. Whitewash: The Disturbing Truth About Cow’s Milk and Your Health by Joseph Keon
Whitewash is by far the best book written on the subject of dairy. It’s as convincing as Diet for a New America or The China Study, and should be required reading for all. Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows by Melanie Joy, PhD
Joy coins a new word, “carnism,” that roughly translates as “the hidden ideology that both hides yet reinforces that eating some animals is OK.” Why We Love Pigs proposes that giving a name to an aberrant behavior is the first step toward dismantling it.  Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals by Marc Bekoff, PhD and Jessica Pierce
Bekoff and Pierce offer convincing science that shows morality in undomesticated animals, removing from the ever-shrinking list yet another “human-only behavior” for our increasingly non-anthropomorphic world. See also Second Nature. Extra! Extra! Two recently published books were just received in the VN offices that I have barely been able to glance through at press time. Given the prowess of their authors, both could very well warrant inclusion on this list. Tom Regan and Andrew Linzey edited Other Nations, a collection of fiction from mostly renowned authors (Orwell, Hemingway) that “illuminates our moral relationship with animals.”  Gary Francione and Robert Garner have written The Animal Rights Debate, which tackles the “rights” vs. “welfare” argument in the US and elsewhere from legal and philosophical perspectives.

EASY VEGAN HOLIDAY RECIPES AND TIPS,https://vegnews.com/2010/11/easy-vegan-holiday-recipes-and-tips,"NOVEMBER 28, 2010","The worst part of the holiday season is getting stuck at a party with no savory veg nibbles in sight, no refuge at the dessert table, and nothing in your belly but resentment for the jolly cocktail waitress making the rounds with trays of pigs-in-a-blanket. To guarantee that you, too, get to stand around the water cooler complaining about gaining the traditional five pounds this holiday season, why not just host your own delicious, veganized ho-ho-holiday party? There’s no greater holiday gift you can give your friends and family than a warm gathering during the cold season. The Décor
Before you deck the halls, consider this startling eco-stat: according to the EPA, household trash in the US increases by 25 percent between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, from 4 million to 5 million tons. Don’t feel like contributing to the landfill problem? Try our eco-friendly ideas for dressing up your space without trashing the planet. Bring the Outdoors In
For decor that’s as stylish as it is sustainable, Kimberly Nolder of Eco-Event Planning in Adamstown, PA, suggests asking your local Christmas-tree farm for branch trimmings. (You can usually get these for free.) String your fragrant greenery with twinkly holiday lights and use it to frame doorways. When the party’s over, “you can even recycle live trees and use in mulch piles,” says Nolder.  Fire it Up!
Consider the Java-Log. Made from used, dried coffee grounds (waste from the coffee industry) and vegetable wax, Java-Logs burn as long or longer than wood logs and produce 87 percent less carbon monoxide. They also divert 20 million pounds of coffee grounds that would otherwise wind up in landfills each year. CleanFlame logs are made entirely from wax-coated produce boxes, of which 600,000 tons are sent to landfills annually after use. Goodwood fire logs, made with woodchips and sawdust waste from various sources, claim to create up to 50 percent fewer emissions with no added binders, as the natural resins in the wood bind the log through the compression process. Contributing to global warming is the last thing you need to think about when relaxing by the fireplace. The “Wow!” Centerpiece
For table decor, Nolder suggests piling your prettiest plate with candles, followed by walnuts, cranberries, and sprigs of greenery. If you’re feeling really crafty, steal an idea from the ’70s and add sweet-smelling orange-and-clove pomanders by poking whole cloves into an intact orange or tangerine. Add to your plate of candles and breathe deeply. Get Crafty
Nolder recommends using recycled paper (such as holiday gift wrap or greeting cards) to create simple origami birds to add to a centerpiece, hang from the ceiling, or tuck into that inventible holiday gift: the poinsettia plant. Not feeling that crafty? Try scaling down your eco-footprint with a bonsai tree strung with a simple strand of cranberries. The Menu
Planning a dinner party for a few friends—no problem. But a dinner party for a few friends, their dates, your whole office, your family, and the lone neighbor you invited in the elevator? Not so easy. Before confining yourself to the kitchen for an extended spell—then checking yourself into a clinic for exhaustion—try these simple menu suggestions that’ll dazzle even your self-proclaimed “blood-thirsty” aunt from Transylvania. The Festive Drink
Any of these delicious, warming drinks will keep your friends and family cozy and content. Whether or not you add a holiday spirit (aka booze!) is up to you! The Celebratory Hors d’oeuvres
Roasted Red Pepper Dip—Just try and find any remnant of this addictive spread once the party’s over

It just doesn’t get any more festive than a Holiday Spiced Crème Brûlée. VN contributor Chloe Coscarelli shares her simple, show-stopping dessert. When you’re having your hand at it, just make sure the blowtorch is in the hands of someone who has not yet indulged in the spiked eggless nog. Safety first!

UNCLEAN SHRIMP,https://vegnews.com/2010/11/unclean-shrimp,"NOVEMBER 27, 2010","Over the past decade, cheap shrimp has become increasingly popular in North America, with the majority of the product being shipped to the US and Canada from Asia.

Seafood import inspectors have found that much of the shrimp coming from Thailand, one of the leading exporters of the seafood, are filled with antibiotics that are illegal for food production in the US and Canada, making the prawns dangerous to eat.

THANKSGIVING IDEAS FROM THE BEST VEGAN BLOGGERS,https://vegnews.com/2010/11/thanksgiving-ideas-from-the-best-vegan-bloggers,"NOVEMBER 21, 2010","VegNews reported on this year’s advent of Vegan MoFo before the fated month of innovative vegan food blog posts, and now we find ourselves more than halfway through MoFo, just on the cusp of Thanksgiving. If hours spent perusing vegan blogs have told us anything, it’s that MoFoers know how to do Thanksgiving! Innumerable bloggers have posted Thanksgiving-related content—from meat cakes to taquitos to tarts, and we’ve been paying attention. The Thanksgiving MoFo madness arguably got going after VegNews Editor-At-Large Laura Hooper Beck issued a challenge on Vegansaurus to reproduce a Thanksgiving “cake” that included turkey, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, and marshmallows. Vegan Good Things, Vegan Sugar and Spice, and Mo Betta Vegan were among those who responded, creating towering works of art including ingredients such as vegan marshmallows, Tofurky, mashed sweet potatoes, seitan, cranberry sauce, and more. These structures of one-stop Thanksgiving delight must be seen to be believed! With her mind keenly focused on potential Thanksgiving menus, Mo, from Mo Betta Vegan, recently came up with her own potential Thanksgiving feast, including Seitan En Croute, mac and cheeze, collard and sausage stuffing, baked tofu, and cashew gravy. MoFo founder herself Isa Chandra Moskowitz posted an invaluable Thanksgiving-in-an-hour menu on her Post Punk Kitchen blog complete with chickpea cutlets, Three-Ingredient Cranberry Sauce, Roasted Broccoli, Savory Mushroom Gravy, and Fluffy Mashed Potatoes. Kim Garr of C’est La Vegan also prepared a list of Thanksgiving potentials, including the downright drool-worthy Pepper-Crusted Cashew Goat Cheese, Cauliflower Bisque with Buttered Breadcrumbs, Green Bean Casserole, Holiday Nut Roast, and Pumpkin Patch Cheesecake. “I love participating in Vegan MoFo because while it’s definitely a challenge, it’s also a great shot in the arm for the blog, and forces me to stay on top of posting everyday,” she says. “It also feels like a special event since so many people participate,” says Garr, who also runs the C’est La V online bakeshop that produces vegan baked goods and also provides vegan catering. Garr’s dream Thanksgiving spread is classic, but perfect, including mashed potatoes, gravy, sweet potato casserole, and biscuits, but she also says that “actually I think my dream would be for all of it to magically appear while I sit back and relax, and then for the dishes to be magically washed afterwards.” Garr chose her blog spread after starting the tradition of hosting an all-vegan Thanksgiving. “In the three years of hosting we’ve only had one other vegan at the table. The fact that our non-vegan friends love the food and have favorites that they request is the highest compliment to me. So when putting together the Thanksgiving post, I wanted to include my favorite dishes, along with the ones that seem to be favorites with our guests. Then I tried to include some of things I often serve at parties that are also big hits with non-vegans, mainly in the appetizer section of the post. I also chose to feature a couple things that aren’t traditionally associated with the holiday (like Chocolate Chip Date Cake), but that are really tasty, and would make a nice addition alongside the usual Thanksgiving suspects.” For stunning side dishes, try the Brussels Sprouts Hash from Vegan Soul Power, Mashed Acorn Squash from Veggiegirl Health Counseling, and Green Bean Casserole from Etsy Vegan. Centerpieces abound with Robin Robertson’s Thanksgiving Meat Pie, Thanksgiving taquitos, Roasted Vegetable Tart, and Holiday Ham. A VegNews favorite is Terry Hope Romero’s cornbread stuffing, perfect for dressing roasted winter squash. When dessert time rolls around (finally!), try a sweet digestif in the form of Limoncello, or just dig straight into the Vanilla Pumpkin Pie. Whichever way you play it, have a happy Thanksgiving, and spend your Buy Nothing Day reading what promises to be a multitude of vegan bloggers recounting their own delicious Thanksgivings via the Vegan MoFo google feed over at Vegan MoFo Headquarters International.

INSPIRING VEGAN TEEN ACTIVISTS,https://vegnews.com/2010/11/inspiring-vegan-teen-activists,"NOVEMBER 16, 2010","Most of us have been there: Life as a teenager is hard enough without the added challenge of being the only vegan in gym class. But today, encouragingly, teens across the globe are leading the way with compassionate action by choosing a plant-based diet. In October, 17-year-old Nia Froome of Valley Stream, NY, made national headlines after winning the 2010 Oppenheimer Funds and Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) National Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge with her compassionate company, Mamma Nia’s Vegan Bakery. In addition to taking home a $10,000 cash prize—a portion of which she donated to breast-cancer research—Froome won the opportunity to meet President Obama. Froome’s plant-based business is only one example of a vegan teen taking mainstream culture by storm with activism. In 2009, VegNews featured two teens, Rain Melody Corbett and Meili Swanson, in our article “20 Under 30,” which profiled young activists making a difference in the vegan movement. Corbett, of Titusville, Fla., founded Peaceable Kids, a grassroots organization focused on raising awareness about the meat and dairy industries, and Swanson, of Johns Creek, Ga., established Teen Georgia Animal Rights & Protection Group (Teen GARP). In 2008, Swanson was awarded the Young Animal Activist award at the Animal Rights National Conference held by Farm Animal Rights Movement. While some vegan teens choose activism in the form of vegan businesses or community groups, others are trying to create change in school—or at least, in their parents kitchens. High school student Nicole Elena from Springfield, Mass. told VegNews that the biggest challenge to identifying as a teen vegan is encountering people who assume you are not committed. “It’s hard to be taken seriously as a teenager, even if you’re not as vapid as your peers,” says Elena. “Being vegan at home isn’t difficult because my mom is vegan too, but the food at school sucks.” Though Elena’s school offers veg options, they are apparently less than desirable. “We have a catering service, but they don’t know how to cook,” she says. Mary Hildebrandt is a 16-year-old from Calgary, Alberta, who is vegan in a very non-vegan land. “Lots of my friends have families that own [cattle] feedlots, and that sucks,” she says. “It’s never really easy to explain why I’m not willing to eat the beef that their families make.” Hildebrandt says that her veganism, now one year strong, inspired her to seek out alternatives for places to dine in Calgary. “I discovered The Coup, which is a vegetarian restaurant I definitely wouldn’t have found unless I was looking.” Hildebrandt says the vegetarian, organic restaurant is her favorite in the city, due to a killer tempeh Reuben. It’s up to vegan teens to form their own veg groups in high school, since it’s not exactly common to come across pre-existing clubs. “There used to be an environmental group, but the members weren’t even vegetarian,” says Elena. Hildebrandt would like to start a club, and has talked about it with her school’s vice principal, who is vegetarian and supportive. The problem is that there doesn’t appear to be a great deal of potential members. “There just aren’t a lot of vegetarians in Calgary, let alone vegans!” says Hildebrandt. She finds it hard sometimes, but says that her aunt and her aunt’s husband are both vegan, and that her enthusiasm for vegan cooking has influenced her mom and brother. “My mom thought I was crazy at first,” she says. But Hildebrandt’s family has responded well to recipes she has made from her favorite vegan cookbook, Yellow Rose Recipes by Joanna Vaught. When it comes to reasons for going vegan, both Elena and Hildebrandt cite animals as their major reason for choosing a plant-based diet. “It’s all for the animals,” says Elena, “I wish I could say it was for my health (which is where I started out), but I’m a sickly kid and that’s not going to change.” Hildebrandt went vegan after finally aligning her ethics with her diet. “I just couldn’t eat animal products when I learned about what goes on in animal farming,” Hildebrandt says. “It’s cruel.” Elena offers a last piece of advice for vegan teens. “Arm yourself with knowledge and swagger,” she says. Having strong faith in her convictions and unwavering confidence has helped Hildebrandt. For teenagers who are eager to help make change for animals but don’t know where to begin, there are several great resources online. Humane Teen (run by the Human Society of the United States) offers a fantastic website for the teen vegans and the vegan-curious, and PETA2 (run by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is also a resource for compassionate youth. Both sites have suggestions for teens hoping to form veg groups in their own schools. "
VEGAN BACHELOR PARTY,https://vegnews.com/2010/11/vegan-bachelor-party,"NOVEMBER 16, 2010","From May 19 to 22, 2011, vegan men are invited to come to Las Vegas for what organizers are calling a “Vegan Bachelor Party.” The event was born when a group of vegan friends realized they had never had bachelor parties and thus began planning a trip to Las Vegas. The event quickly grew and now includes informational educational sessions on plant-based living, group activities, and tools to combat stereotypes of vegan men. “We live in a culture where men are perceived to be less masculine if they don’t consume animal products,” said Ryan Henn, the event’s organizer. “It’s my hope that this event helps shatter that myth.” Men of all ages are invited to intend regardless if vegan or not, though everyone must eat 100-percent vegan on the trip.

TURKEY TIME,https://vegnews.com/2010/11/turkey-time,"NOVEMBER 12, 2010","As dropping temperatures, twinkle lights, and the fa-la-la music that sings out of car radios signal, it is officially the holiday season. Now is the time of year for being grateful, spreading joy, and embracing peace. Just like greeting cards abound tell us, ’tis the season of togetherness, giving, and love. In other words, it’s a season of celebrating compassion. Year after year, to celebrate, families and friends come together in a physical manifestation of Norman Rockwell’s Thanksgiving portrayal, gathered around the holiday table to break bread. And yet at the focal point of the painting is the turkey, a creature who lived anything but a life of freedom. The proud bird now on a platter instead most likely spent his short life on a crowded factory farm, where he was afforded no comfort, little care, and much fear and disgrace. Crammed into a warehouse with sometimes thousands of other birds, the turkeys then face the elements, unguarded, driven to slaughter, if he even survives that long. Only then does he become the centerpiece, the focal point of the meal, and traditionally, the very epicenter of the American holiday table. The creature that received Benjamin Franklin’s vote to be the national bird over the bald eagle, was meant to lead an enriching, full life, each one possessing his or her own individual personality. Wild turkeys have more than 20 unique vocalizations that can be heard more than a mile away, and they use these voices to recognize and communicate with one another. A turkey emotes through its snood, the flap of skin that hangs over the turkey’s neck. As Jenny Brown, co-founder and director of Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary in Woodstock, NY, says, “They have mood-ring like heads that change color depending on their excitement level,” and the snood can “shrink and grow depending on [their] mood.” Additionally, wild turkeys are capable of learning the geography of an area as large as 1,000 acres, through which, on short sprints, wild turkeys can run up to 18 miles per hour. They also have the ability to take short flights, bursting into the air like a helicopter. But put a large, brown and golden-feathered wild turkey alongside a commercially raised, factory-farm turkey, and the vast discrepancies are obvious. The commercial turkey has been stripped of its camouflaged feathers, bred to have starkly white plumage, a result of the consumer desire for all-white meat. The commercial turkey will appear more swollen—between 1965 and 2000, the average weight of a turkey rose 57 percent. This is a result of harmful breeding practices intending to create bigger, bulkier, meatier turkeys. Because people are willing to pay more and more for bigger turkey breasts, the birds suffer. His insides grow faster than his frail, avian skeleton can bear, culminating in a long list of ailments. His legs, toes, and joints will suffer, and he’ll never be able to fly, roost, or run. Even more drastic, the swollen breasts make it physically impossible for the turkey to mount and procreate, thus farmers must artificially inseminate the female birds. He has been de-beaked and de-toed so as not to accidentally hurt the other turkeys with whom he lives in unbearably close quarters. And at the end of the line, it’s estimated that nearly 300 million turkeys are killed each year in the US, 45 million of those for the Thanksgiving holiday alone. And yet the turkey remains one of the most iconic tokens of the holiday season, an emblem of Americana. They are transported and killed for the Thanksgiving table, they are sold live off of farms, and they are used as incentives for holiday promotions. But in the midst of the dark, rancid life the turkey lives is a solitary beam of hope: the farm sanctuary. Something truly to be thankful for this holiday season are the farm sanctuaries working to rescue and liberate turkeys and provide for them the life they deserve. Kathy Stevens, founder of Catskill Animal Sanctuary (CAS) in New York’s Hudson Valley, says that while the sanctuary receives turkeys all year round, “We get more bizarre calls about turkeys in distress around the holiday time.” This was the case with Petunia, a small female turkey rescued by Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary (WFAS). Petunia was found being chased by kids down New York streets the day after Thanksgiving. The story goes that a father had brought her to the Thanksgiving table as a gag, after which he put Petunia in the backyard, from where she then escaped. Scooped up just in time by WFAS, she was taken to her first warm barn, temporarily placed in an isolated pen until workers ensured she didn’t have any parasites she could pass on to the other turkeys. It’s a good thing she was clean, because Petunia wasn’t about to wait to meet her new friends. She was still young, and small enough to fly over the wall and join the other turkeys. Today, Brown says Petunia “tears across the yard or driveway from one point to the next for no apparent reason…she’ll get a notion and start running, just because she can—and she’s found a place where she gets to do what she wants and be exactly whom she is.” As evidenced by Petunia’s eagerness to join her feathered brethren, turkeys often form strong bonds with one another, creating a “social network like anybody else,” says Gene Baur, co-founder and president of Farm Sanctuary. “You bring in somebody new, they sort of adjust to how they relate to each other…you remove certain ones…they miss their friends,” Baur says. Not only do turkeys become attached to one another, but also they often can find friends among other species. Such was the case with Ian, a shy turkey, left out of his flock at Peaceful Prairie Sanctuary (PPS) in Deer Trail, Colo. Having spent most of his time unsure and alone, PPS volunteer Joanna Lucas writes in her story “Ian’s Crossing” that he was “a shy and serious bird, a grave and silent little person, craving tenderness.” That tenderness came when a hen rescued from a backyard egg operation named Simone came to PPS. The two “gravitated toward each other,” Lucas writes. When Simone fell ill and needed constant care inside of the house, Ian sat patiently each day at the front door, waiting for the volunteers to bring Simone out so he could nestle beside her pillow. And when Simone finally passed, they brought Ian her empty pillow, next to which he sat all summer long. Turkeys have been known to create strong connections with humans as well. “Once they trust that they’re safe, they do tend to seek people out,” Stevens says. “They sit in our laps, they coo when they’re happy, they put their wings down on the ground, which is sort of the turkey equivalent of a huge smile.” At Farm Sanctuary in Orland, Calif. lives Lydia, the “hugging turkey,” Baur says. If one of Lydia’s human friends were to come visit her in the barn, Baur says, she would graciously greet them by craning her neck. This Thanksgiving, vegetarians, farm sanctuaries, and even Ellen DeGeneres (Farm Sanctuary’s official sponsor for its annual Adopt-A-Turkey event) are encouraging Americans everywhere to keep turkeys off our plates, end the cycle of cruelty, and celebrate these marvelous birds.

Since World Go Vegan Month is upon us for the month of November, now is the perfect time to show everyone we know just how easy living vegan can be, complete with incredibly tasty food. Like all cooking, vegan food can range from easy to complicated, comforting to risqué, innovative to classic. So many people share compassion for animals, but seem to think that a jump to veganism is just too radical a move when it comes to diet. Not so! Preparing cruelty-free food is just as easy as any other type of cooking, so tie on an apron and whip up a delicious introduction to this fantastic lifestyle. Basic Meals
While I’m sure we’d all love to be eating Vegetable Seitan Almondine and Chocolate Chiffon Mousse Cupcakes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, sometimes more simple fare is the best place to start. This is where staples such as Portobello mushroom burgers paired with oven-roasted potatoes and a simple salad shine. Stumped on vegan breakfasts? Keep things simple with classic (and thrifty!) oatmeal, juices, and smoothies, or go for heartier fare such as Sunday Morning Tofu Benedict with Hollandaise Sauce. Check out some of our favorite Quick Breakfast Fixes for more. Parties and Holidays

Impress the heck out of your fellow diners with Siu Mai dumplings, Eggplant Soup, and a Pear and Fig Tart for dessert. Thanksgiving happens to fall in the vegan month of food, which might be the most challenging time for omnivores to get down with a vegan diet. But as experienced vegans know, the rich dishes characteristic of the holiday are totally attainable. Creamy Harvest Pasta can take on turkey as a centerpiece dish any day, as can Maple Tofu with Stuffing and Apple Cranberry Chutney, or Squash with Wild Rice and Chanterelle Stuffing with Rich Brown Gravy. Serve your swanky entrées with complementary dishes such as Marinated Mushrooms, Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Cashew Butter Sauce, Watercress and Sunchoke Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette, or Pioneer Cornbread. Looking for something simple to mimic the stuffed turkey standard? Gardein is now selling their frozen pre-cooked Stuffed Turk’y Roast in stores nationwide, and all you’ll need is a batch of mashed potatoes, gravy, and some salad to round out that easy feast.

A year that began with nominee Food, Inc. losing the Best Documentary Oscar to The Cove proved cinematically fortuitous. Animal Planet announced Blood Dolphins, a Cove spin-off; the anti-fur documentary Skin Trade and the re-released Peaceable Kingdom: The Journey Home won multiple “best of” film festival awards; and the feature-length animal-rights drama Bold Native sold-out screenings—one hosted by Russel Simmons—coast-to-coast. Global Powerhouse
In June, the United Nations Environment Program released a report calling for a worldwide shift away from animal products, stating that a plant-based diet was the best way to save the planet from world hunger and the impact of climate change. The report states the only sustainable diet is one rich in plant-based foods and details the damaging and far-reaching effects of eating animals, declaring that factory-farming practices are as harmful to the environment as burning fossil fuels. Media Maven
Jane Velez-Mitchell, veteran TV journalist, 14-year-vegan, and host of the Emmy-award winning nightly Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell, has made it her mission to expose animal exploitation to the masses. Velez-Mitchell covers at least one animal-related story every week, ranging from the effects of the Gulf Coast Oil Spill to the historic animal-welfare legislation passed this spring in Ohio. With 100 million viewers in the US alone and 50,000 Facebook fans, there’s no denying the impact of this media powerhouse. Humanitarians for Haiti
When a devastating 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck just south of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in January, relief efforts mobilized across the world. In Portland, Ore., author and activist Isa Chandra Moskowitz posted a call-to-action on her blog at The Post Punk Kitchen: Vegans, let’s bake. Compassionate herbivores across the country banded together to host sales in their home cities to fundraise for relief. The result? An incredible $75,000 was raised and donated. Retail Blunder
The enzyme and probiotic-rich Kombucha is naturally fermented—less than 0.5 percent alcohol per serving—with the buzz level kept under control by refrigeration. When shipped, if left unrefrigerated, the active product continues to ferment, raising the alcohol content slightly, and every brand of raw Kombucha sold tested above the 0.5 level. Certain litigation-wary health food stores and suppliers decided to pull all brands. You’ll soon be able to buy it again—with an ID. Daddy Warbucks Award
This year, Bob Barker’s generous donations proved that the 87-year-old activist is as passionate as ever about helping animals. Barker gifted $5 million to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, $1 million to Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK) to help end pigeon shoots, 2.5 million to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and an additional $250,000 in matching donations to rescue animals used for “entertainment.” DIY Revolution
Resilient Americans have rose to the occasion since the beginning of the recession, fueling a fast-growing trend of all things DIY. Gardens are sprouting up in backyards and on urban rooftops across the country, cash-strapped do-it-yourselfers are pickling, preserving, brewing, sewing, knitting, and cooking. Online store etsy.com has legitimized the homesteading trend and Vegan Etsy boasts more than 38,000 products in its vegan category. Sanctuaries 2.0
From all-star events to ever-greater influence, animal sanctuaries have made their mark this year. Animal Acres stages a celeb-heavy gala each September; Animal Place, now in its 21st year, held a “barn warming” party on July 3 at its new 600-acre Grass Valley, Calif., sanctuary, the largest in the country; Catskill Animal Sanctuary’s co-founder Kathy Stevens has published two heartwarming books about her rescued animals; and Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary stages everything from sanctuary concerts to art shows. Dynamic Duo
The upcoming launch of Spork Online will take Heather and Jenny Goldberg’s incredibly successful LA-based cooking classes worldwide, providing a welcoming, accessible community for anyone interested in healthy living—think how-to cooking videos, recipes, helpful Q&A, and beyond. Offline, a chic West Hollywood loft calls itself Spork Foods’ new home, playing host to not only the duo’s sold-out classes, but also film viewings, workshops, weekly yoga classes, and private cooking parties. With the majority of clients first attending as omnivores, the sisters are changing outlooks on a regular basis. Best Day of the Week
In 2010, the move to reduce meat consumption one day per week gained unprecedented mainstream momentum, with endorsements from both cities and celebrities alike. San Francisco was the first US city to pass an official motion promoting a plant-based diet, with Washington, DC following. Celebrities are also doing their part to promote plant-based diets, including Mario Batali cementing his support for Meat-Free Mondays. Pizza Explosion
For decades, pizza has been the Holy Grail of veganism for one reason: the cheese. It was one of the last remaining holdout foods for aspiring vegans. But now, according to pizzerias everywhere, one cheese has changed everything: Daiya, VN’s 2009 Product of the Year. Heralded as “meltable, stretchable, and delicious,” the popular dairy-free cheese is making believers out of both pizza eateries and its customers across the country. Raw Reverie
Though brands such as Organic Nectars have been available via mail order since 2004, it wasn’t until the 95-percent raw cashew- and coconut-based Alkemie hit retail shelves last November that the category really took off. Henry’s Frozen Delight, Raw Ice Cream Company, and KindKreme are all now creating flavors and frozen concoctions to rival any traditional ice cream out there. Bakery Bonanza
Simply put, baked goods are blowing up Champs, an old world-style bakery and café that opened its doors in Brooklyn this August, revolutionizes New York classics such as black-and-white cookies; and Babycakes NYC opened an Los Angeles this January. Chloe Coscarelli trumped her three non-vegan competitors on an episode of Food Network’s Cupcake Wars in June; and Cinnaholic, a vegan cinnamon roll store opened in July in Berkeley, Calif. Simply put, veganism has never been sweeter. Locavore v. Vegan Controversy
Though the locavore movement first started gaining traction in 2007, the non-vegan aspects of its message have been debated this year in unprecedented ways. From classes on keeping backyard chickens to slaughtering your own rabbits, locavorism moved in a decidedly bloody direction. Media outlets from The New York Times to Mother Jones have covered the debate over whether locally raised, grass-fed meat is more ecologically friendly than ditching animal products all together. The one thing that emerges from the clutter of debate is the consistent horror over the ethics of needlessly slaughtering animals. "

Each of the poster ads touch on both the histories and personalities of the animals, and explains how they are exploited by humans. They all conclude with the message: “Don’t depend on luck. Create Your Own Future.” Though the ads were originally designed as recruitment posters for the school, telling students they shouldn’t depend on luck when choosing an art school, Creative Director Frank Anselmo says, “the concept naturally supports animals,” and the ads inherently question the use of animals for consumption.

"VEGANMOFO, THE VEGAN BLOG TAKEOVER",https://vegnews.com/2010/10/veganmofo-the-vegan-blog-takeover,"OCTOBER 24, 2010","Four years ago, Isa Chandra Moskowitz, author extraordinaire, pitched a vegan blogging event modeled after National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) to the Post Punk Kitchen forums, wherein newbie and established bloggers alike would commit to blogging regularly about vegan food and the vegan lifestyle for one month of the year. The Vegan Month of Food (Vegan MoFo) has grown in spades since its inaugural year, and one of its organizers and fourth-year participant, Kittee Berns, told VegNews about her love for all things MoFo, along with her own current projects. Last year, Berns hosted the MoFo blogroll on her own blog, Cake Maker to the Stars, did administrative work developing the public RSS feed, and maintained the list of MoFo-ers—no small feat as almost 500 blogs participated—all of which needed to be manually hyperlinked. “We are letting Google help us with some of the administrative things this year, which is awesome, but I am still doing a lot of the behind the scenes things—answering email, tidying up the MoFo blog, creating an RSS feed, tweeting, summarizing, and of course, blogging myself silly, if all goes as planned,” Berns says. Berns has seen massive growth in MoFo since 2007. She maintains that MoFo’s exponential growth is mostly due to Moskowitz’s popularity—“she is the main headliner for MoFo, and anything she backs or gets involved in draws scores of vegans and vegan-interested folks” she says. MoFo has also gained popularity due to talented vegans of all professions getting involved, such as Amanda Chronister, who designed this year’s new logos. Berns says they currently have almost 300 blogs signed up from 15 different countries. Participants keep their content interesting and original by playing around with themes. “Vegan MoFo has always been in either October or November so that lends itself to Halloween, Thanksgiving, and autumnal themes easily. We’ve also had culinary contests, veganized family recipes, cookbook addicts, and then others whose only theme was blogging every single day throughout the entire month. The trend I’ve really noticed this year is that we have crazy amounts of MoFo newbies signing on board, almost half of our current participants are new to Vegan MoFo,” Berns says. As far as Berns herself is concerned, MoFo offers a great opportunity to focus on two current projects she is hoping to get moving; one a vegan cookbook comprised of New Orleans recipes she has been working on for several years, and the other a vegan gluten-free zine. Berns penned the zine Papa Tofu, and enjoys working in the zine format as it is “a little less intimidating and a little more creative.” She hopes to have the gluten-free zine ready to go in early 2011. Gluten-free vegan food is very important to Berns. Her fibromyalgia flared following her evacuation from New Orleans two years ago due to 2008’s Hurricane Gustav, and she was desperate to find a way to cope with the pain. “I was stuck on a couch for weeks upon weeks due to horrible myofascial pain,” Berns says. Since she’d never tried it before, Berns decided to give up gluten on a whim, after reading that a lot of other fibromyalgia sufferers have benefited from the diet change. “Now, I feel 75 percent better than I’ve felt in the last 20 years, so I’m sticking with it forever. It can be emotionally challenging to be gluten-free as a vegan, which is one of the reasons I want to write a zine about it.” Berns shares with VegNews several recipes she has developed that are both NoLa-inspired and gluten-free. For a vegan taste of New Orleans, we highly recommend her Smothered Black Eyed Peas, and for dessert, Pecan Pralines are divine. For the ultimate crispy kale doubling as a killer gluten-free snack food, try her Cheezie, Crunchy Kale Chips. For Vegan MoFo, Berns also hopes to wrangle up some omnivores and convince them to go vegan for a week or longer, as well as do something to commemorate her 20th anniversary of being vegan. “My absolute favorite thing about MoFo-ing is the community that comes together around the event—everyone is supportive, excited, and writing about vegan food,” Berns says. To sign up for Vegan MoFo, head to the Vegan MoFo Headquarters International. If blogging’s not your thing, you will still have the opportunity to read a slew of passionate vegans blogs updated religiously for the entire month of November. We recommend telling your non-vegan friends and family about MoFo, who might just want to add a few blogs to their Google Reader feeds. Happy 2010 Vegan MoFo! "

ANIMAL-ABUSE REGISTRIES: WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THEY WORK,https://vegnews.com/2010/10/animal-abuse-registries-what-they-are-and-how-they-work,"OCTOBER 24, 2010","On October 12, 2010, Suffolk County, NY, unanimously passed a law that created the nation’s first animal-abuser registry. Suffolk County, located on the eastern half of Long Island, is home to 1.5 million people and an unknown amount of animals, both of whom the legislation will benefit immensely. The registry, to be administered by the county’s Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), will require animal abusers to register with the site and provide up-to-date information of their address, picture, and other identifiable details for five years after their offense. The required fees from the abusers will support the registry financially, and failing to register can result in a fine of up to 1,000 dollars and up to a year in prison. While Suffolk County is the first government entity to pass such an ordinance, the concept is a part of a bigger movement, headed and championed by the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), and their campaign, Expose Animal Abusers. Countless organizations across the country work to rescue and alleviate animals from suffering imposed by abusers. But more than acting as reactionaries, organizations look to develop ways to be proactive in stopping animal abuse. The idea of doing so through tracking animal abusers is not new. In 1986, Roni McCall was working in various shelters and made the observation that though many had lists of individuals not suitable to adopt, there was no system for communicating these names between shelters. In 1986, she began Through Their Eyes, a database that attempts to log animal abusers. “It isn’t anything fancy and doesn’t have a lot of bells and whistles—just a simple Excel spreadsheet,” she says, that’s made available to the public. Still with a small staff of volunteers, it’s hard for Through Their Eyes to keep up with enormous amount of cases that occur. In the late ’90s, Megan’s Laws were enacted in states across the country, establishing registries for sex offenders. Stephan Otto, Director of Legislative Affairs with the ADLF. took notice, and understood that the same system and benefits could be applied to animal abusers. In 2001, Otto drafted model legislation to enact an animal-abuser registry. Colorado was the first state to test the bill in 2002, followed by Rhode Island in 2003, and Tennessee in 2008 and 2009, though for various reasons, a registry has never been enacted until this year. The goals of an animal-abuser registry extend beyond that of a crime database, which mostly acts as a listing of crimes committed. By providing more detailed and updated information, Otto says ADLF’s legislation addresses two goals: to save lives and to save money. Having a registry helps to ensure the well-being of animals and people alike. “Owing to the strong connection between those who abuse animals and those who commit other types of violent crimes in our communities, having these people on a registry will hopefully reduce the chances of them harming new victims, whether they’re animals or people,” Otto says. Through providing this information of adult offenders in a publicly available form, the registry will arm individuals to make informed decisions regarding both their animals and their family members. Additionally, shelters and other agencies in the companion animal business can use the registry as a means to better screen potential guardians. Unfortunately, animal abusers are likely to strike again—animal hoarders, for instance, have been found to have a recidivism rate approaching 100 percent, Otto says. The registry works to take away the position to reoffend, which not only saves victims, but can save the state money in costly court cases. Prosecuting animal abusers can cost tens of thousands of dollars, from the shelter and care of animals to attorney and court fees. Looking at the proposed legislation, many states have established the cost of a registry at a fairly low level, Otto says, thus if it only prevents one or two cases, it has paid for itself. The saved resources can then be allocated toward serving other animal needs in the community. With nearly 4,000 cases waiting to be input to the Through Their Eyes registry, McCall says she would be happy to be put out of a job by registries being established in every state. And with the first legislation having gone through, that is now more a reality than ever. “Getting the first one through is always huge,” Otto says. “Legislators are more keen on following sometimes than being the first.” There are currently animal-abuse registry bills in states such as New York, California, Louisiana, Washington, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Utah, Tennessee, and Virginia. Though the ADLF anticipates the model laws will see variation throughout the country, the direction of the laws and the impact they could potentially have on animals remains the same. It’s an opportunity to save the lives and the well-being of an untold amount of animals.

5 EFFECTIVE WAYS TO CONQUER COLD SEASON,https://vegnews.com/2010/10/5-effective-ways-to-conquer-cold-season,"OCTOBER 19, 2010","It might always feel like “that time of year,” but the beginning of fall and entry into winter is, in general, when the dreaded cold season begins. Fall colds result in sniffly, feverish, unhappy people being forced to miss work and other commitments due to bugs that just don’t seem to ever want to go away. Though an arsenal of cold-fighting meds exist in local pharmacies, more often than not these products are not vegan and are loaded with ingredients you don’t want to ingest no matter how bad you are feeling. For cold remedies that actually work without loading up on chemicals, try these recipes and alternative medicines. Feed A Cold
Unless you have a full-blown stomach flu (and if that is the case, go to the doctor!), you’ll still have at least a bit of an appetite, so feed your cold with healing and warming foods that contain immunity-boosting and healing properties. There is, of course, the under-the-weather mainstay of miso: Try Feel Better Miso, Vegetable Stew with Red Wine and Miso, or just steam up some vitamin-rich veggies such as broccoli or kale, and pour on some easy Shiitake Mushroom and Miso Gravy. Soup’s On
Got a Vitamix or a high-powered blender? Raw soups are an amazing way to pack in the vitamins without destroying any of the ingredients’ immune-boosting enzymes, and after trying a few recipes; you’ll develop a keen instinct for complementary raw soup ingredients. Start with raw recipes such as Twice the Tomato Soup to use up the last of this year’s crop of heirloom tomatoes, or Garden Greens Soup for Vitality. The queen of vegan soups herself, Robin Robertson, brings us cooked soup recipes such as Faux Pho and Barley Soup with Porcini and Dill to pass onto our loved ones to make when we can’t fathom the thought of climbing out of bed. You can always repay the favor later! Food As Supplements
Many foods have been shown to legitimately fight invasive flu and cold bugs. Among these are garlic, oregano (most effectively in its potent oil form), ginger, green tea, leafy greens, mushrooms, carrot juice, and lemon. Touted as not only being a cure for a sore throat but also a natural antibiotic and strengthens the immune system, garlic-lovers usually won’t hesitate to munch on a clove of the allium-family vegetable in the name of health, but those who shy away from garlic might be hesitant. It’s a popular remedy in Europe that many swear by, but no matter how crazy for garlic you are, when you’re already feeling under the weather, it’s best to keep your raw dosage to a maximum of one clove a day in order to avoid stomach irritation. Ginger is a great addition to soups and raw juices, and its warming effect does wonders for the old “sweat-it-out” cure. Ginger has also been widely used in ancient forms of natural medicine such as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. When your cold starts to affect your digestion and you find yourself having a hard time tolerating certain foods, a half-inch piece of sliced fresh ginger dropped in a cup of hot water is an effective tummy-taming cure. Green tea has been long-touted as an immune booster, and with its many antioxidants, even the most skeptical natural medicine naysayer can’t deny its healthfulness. Try it with a teaspoon of agave nectar for a comforting cup of tea. Leafy greens can be added to soups, dried mushrooms can be used to make stock, and fresh shiitakes are a nice addition to soups. If you have a juicer, tonics such as apple-ginger-carrot-garlic-lemon will boost your vitamins and send you on the road to health. Store-Bought Formulations
We’re not going to lie, sometimes you’re going to need the aspirin, or even the antibiotics, but there are definitely other options to consider if your doctor doesn’t yet having you going down that route. Nature’s Way Umcka Cold Care is vegan, as is Sambucol, and New Chapter’s Blockade. When you just begin to feel a cold just coming on, don’t be afraid to take some oregano oil. As spicy and potent as it may taste, many people swear that it’ll kick a cold before it even has a chance to bring you down. Hydration and Sleep
Finally, there is really no substitution for both rest and water. You might feel like a hero ignoring your symptoms and soldiering on, but it’s widely known that taking the time to sleep and constantly hydrate is the most effective way of truly conquering the common cold. So chug a bunch of water, keep sipping that tea, turn off your alarm clock, and we’ll see you when you’re healthy! "

MEAL-SIZED SALADS THAT WILL FILL YOU UP FOR HOURS (WE SWEAR!),https://vegnews.com/2010/10/meal-sized-salads-that-will-fill-you-up-for-hours-we-swear,"OCTOBER 4, 2010","As the temperatures slide and we break out the sweaters, it can seem harder and harder to find the willpower to plan salads for supper when warm and filling pizzas or giant burritos beckon. What we need to remember, and what all vegans should know, is that meal-sized salads need not be boring, and they certainly should be filling. Enjoy these tips on creating hearty and delicious entrée salads to prepare on those colder nights when you’re starving, but don’t want to gorge yourself on heavy takeout. Of course, not all of the ingredients mentioned will be in season, so get creative with what’s available now and look forward to other variations in the months to come. The Basics
When you think salad, you think greens. But do you stop at iceberg and romaine, or do you consider kale, chard, beet greens, arugula, cabbage, shredded Brussels sprouts, or baby bok choy? All these greens can be used raw or lightly steamed in the case of heartier varieties of green such as kale and cabbage, or massaged with a bit of olive oil to tenderize the leaves. Beet greens are to die for, so don’t compost them after separating them from their roots. They’re highly nutritious and the stalks are edible too. Additional basic ingredients include tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, avocado, celery, and onions—whatever is fresh at the farmers’ market or on sale at the grocery store. It might seem like a vegetarian cliché, but don’t scoff at sprouts. Though ubiquitous in 1970’s-style crunchy vegan cafés, no one can deny their health aspects and taste. Try broccoli, clover, lentil, garbanzo, and unique-tasting garlic or onion sprouts. The best part about sprouts is that they need not be expensive in the slightest, since making your own by purchasing an inexpensive sprouter or by fashioning your own homemade version is a cinch. Hearty Starches
People so frequently pass on the opportunity to bulk up a salad with raw or cooked starchy vegetables. Leftover roasted squash, potatoes in any form, cooked beets, roasted eggplant, lightly-steamed or raw broccoli or corn, and pretty much any variety of from-frozen steamed vegetable make colorful additions to serious salads. Expand your horizons even further with braised or roasted fennel, marinated zucchini, steamed daikon, or roasted rutabaga.
For intense flavor additions that should be used modestly, try grated fresh ginger, roasted garlic, minced jalapeños, or caramelized onions. These are ingredients that really take your salad to the next level, so use them creatively, but sparingly. Nutritional Boosters
High-density foods are too often left out as potential salad ingredients. But these are the ones that’ll fill you up, so add some cooked grains (quinoa, brown rice, millet, wheat berries, and buckwheat are all great), nuts and seeds (tamari almonds are an irresistable), and dried fruit (even the powerhouse Goji berries can be used if they’re not combined with too many conflicting flavor combinations). Protein and Toppings
This is where you can really get crazy, and utilize leftovers to their fullest potential. Look no further than the protein experts over at VegWeb for rich dishes that can either be made especially for salad ingredient or tossed in as leftovers. Perfect Falafel, Miso Glazed Tofu, and Easy Thai Sautéed Tofu are excellent recipes that pack in huge flavor. Roasted Chickpeas are the perfect crunchy topping for salads of all kinds, that is, if they make it to the salad before you gobble them all up in handfuls. Dig fake meat? Veganize your own Cobb salad with toppings such as Sausage Crumbles, Mock Crab Cakes, Chicken Fried Tofu, or truly scrumptious Simple Coconut Bacon. Dress It Up
While oil and vinegar dressings might be the easiest and most popular option, leftover hummus, guacamole, Thai Coconut & Mint Salsa, and Black Bean Dip need not shy away from unifying your veggies. Experimenting with making your own salad dressings is an easy way to have inventive fun in the kitchen. For emulsified vinaigrettes, don’t forget to include prepared mustard, which keeps the dressing from separating after you shake it up. In case you’re dressing shy, Lemon-Nut Dressing, fruity Eleven Island Dressing, and Vegan Ranch Dressing are all well worth topping your meal-sized salad. "

WHY EATING YOUR COLORS IS ESSENTIAL,https://vegnews.com/2010/10/why-eating-your-colors-is-essential,"OCTOBER 3, 2010","We’ve known for centuries that a diet centered around plants is optimum. Hippocrates, the Greek physician considered the father of Western medicine, said, “Let food be your medicine and your medicine be your food.” In his encyclopedia of natural history, published around AD 77, Pliny the elder cites the medicinal properties of hundreds of herbs, spices, fruits, and vegetables. And that’s just in the West. The foundation of traditional Asian diets has been plant foods, which play a significant role in disease prevention. Modern research supports this ancient wisdom, as do our instincts. We know we need to consume more plant foods, and we know plant foods are good for us. But what is it about the color that makes them so healthful? The answer is in the phytochemicals. Phytochemicals
Phytochemicals (phyto means “plant”) are manufactured by plants in order to protect themselves from the damage caused by animals or insects, photosynthesis, and bv radiation. When we consume them, they provide the same protection for us that they do for the plant. More than 1,000 different phytochemicals have been identified, and hundreds more are still undiscovered. Although phytochemicals are not technically classified as nutrients, they contain properties associated with disease prevention and treatment, particularly those relating to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension.
Phytochemicals are easy to identify because they are actually the pigments that give fruits, vegetables, and flowers their distinctive colors. We can detect the highest concentrations of different phytochemicals just by looking at a plant’s shade. Taste the Rainbow
Blue anthocyanins found in berries have been linked to fighting diseases ranging from cancer and diabetes to bacterial infections. It’s true that noshing on too many orange fruits and veggies can cause skin to develop an apricot hue, but that shouldn’t stop you from buying sweet potatoes and pumpkin in bulk, as their beta-carotene prevents cognitive degeneration. The vibrant, red betacyanins found in amaranth herbs and beets are natural antioxidants and are thought to fight cancer and improve health by combating free radicals in the body. Folate is a naturally occurring vitamin that helps form red blood cells, metabolizes protein, and increases cell growth. To get your folate fill, eat dark, leafy greens and veggies such as spinach. Don’t munch on carrots to improve vision; instead eat lutein-rich foods such as collard greens and kale, which have been linked to improved eyesight and lowered risk of cataract development. Dull in Color, Not in Nutrients
Just because one color is stronger than another doesn’t mean these foods are void of other phytochemicals; they just occur in lower levels. Bananas, for instance, though yellow in appearance, also contain the blue anthocyanin pigments, but on a smaller scale. This is one of the benefits of eating a variety of plant foods: We’re consuming a number of different phytochemicals.
So, the next time you shop, fill your cart with all the colors of the rainbow (don’t forget white, tan, black, and brown). As a result, you will be eating the most nutrient-rich, flavor-dense, aesthetically exciting diet possible. "
DEFORESTATION 101,https://vegnews.com/2010/10/deforestation-101,"OCTOBER 3, 2010","Forests, in all their majesty, are home to more life and biodiversity than any other ecosystem on earth. Tropical rainforests alone hold more than two thirds of all plant and animal species found on land, many of which have never been discovered or recorded by humans. But each day, forests across the globe are being degraded and destroyed. Nearly all of the native hardwood forests of the eastern US, central and eastern Canada, and Europe are now gone. Each day at least 80,000 acres of forest disappear as a result of humans, and at least another 80,000 acres are destroyed because of natural causes. The loss of forests has slowed, from 39 million acres a year in the 90s to 32 million acres in the past decade, an area the size of Costa Rica. Though the slowing of destruction is a positive move, it’s been speculated that it could only be a temporary lull on account of the global economic crisis. The effects of deforestation are vast—the largest of the two are climate change and the loss of biodiversity. Tropical deforestation accounts for 20 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, making it one of the most serious contributors to environmental change—more than all the automobiles, planes, boats, and trains combined. When forests fall, more carbon is released into the air and opportunities for carbon absorption by trees is lost. Places such as Russia and China are now dealing with desertification, or man-made deserts, the result of deforestation and other poor land practices. Desertification now threatens more than a third of the earth’s surfaces. There are two separate kinds of deforestation—clear-cutting and selective logging. Clear-cutting occurs when most or all of an entire area is taken down, while in selective logging, loggers only cut down the trees that are of use to them. And while re-growth is slowing occurring in some countries, especially throughout North America, second-growth forests are significantly different than the original natural forests, and much of the original wealth and beauty is gone forever.
The countries with the highest rates of deforestation today are Honduras, Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nepal, North Korea, Ecuador, and Haiti. The logging practices in many of which is thought to be corrupt—more than 50 percent of logging in Indonesia, for example, is illegal. The underlying forces of deforestation vary by region and country, thus it is hard to say what is the most prevalent cause of deforestation. However, main culprits are identifiable. Dams
Dams and the harvesting of hydroelectric power in forests such as the Amazon destroy trees through flooding, resettling of people to the area around the dam, and cutting down trees on the shoreline of the dam. Mining
Mini-gold rushes and mining for precious metals such as gold, copper, and diamonds, lead to forest destruction for both campsites and the extraction of the metals. Often times the mines are abandoned, leaving patches of cleared forest in its wake. Fires
Selective logging and fragmentation of forests from agriculture make forests susceptible to the largest natural cause of deforestation—forest fires. Forest fires not only destroy ecosystems and kill wildlife, but they release enormous amounts of carbon into the air. Commercial Agriculture
Commercial agriculture often employs slash-and-burn techniques on hundreds of thousands of acres to make way for large agricultural cultivation of mostly single cash crops such as coffee, coca, tea, soybeans, rubber, bananas, and more. Much of what is harvested is not consumed by humans—70 percent of both soybean and corn produced worldwide is fed to livestock. However, the soil can often not support long-term agricultural efforts, and thus many of the farms are failures. Cattle Ranching
After soils are depleted on farmlands, they are sometimes reverted to cattle pastures. Factory farming has increased more than 600 percent in the past three decades, and today intensive grazing uses more than 27 percent of Earth’s land surface. In addition to clearing forests to make way for the farm animals, meat, egg, and milk production release two billion tons of carbon annually. Lumber harvest
Cutting down trees for conversion to other uses is still a main factor in deforestation. Usage of lumber includes building materials, fuel, and paper products. If society became more environmentally conscious when consuming, deforestation might slowly decline. But on a larger scale, policy changes and initiatives, such as Brazil’s $200 million plan to slow deforestation and put an end to wildfires that destroy its tropical savanna, are needed. To find out how you can help or to learn more about deforestation, visit environmental organization websites such as Monga Bay or Greenpeace. "
5 MEAT-FREE POLITICIANS,https://vegnews.com/2010/10/5-meat-free-politicians,"OCTOBER 3, 2010","We already know Chelsea Clinton’s vegan, but the big news this election cycle is that her dad Bill dropped 24 pounds “on essentially a plant-based diet,” as the former Commander-In-Chief told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. And yet, despite the corpulence-inducing caloric content of meat, dairy, and eggs, the rest of our elected officials continue to eat animal products. OK, not all of them: there are veg leaders at the national, state, and local level making their mark in US politics today. Here are brief profiles of these modern leaders, and a look at how they’ve helped move the veg cause forward. Dennis J. Kucinich—US Congressman (Ohio, 10th District)
Of the 535 members of Congress, Cleveland native Dennis Kucinich is the only vegan, and, during his seven terms in the US House of Representatives (and 15 years as a vegan), he has introduced or co-sponsored virtually every animal protection bill on the legislative docket since 1997. Notably, he was the only member of Congress to vote against the unconstitutional Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, and, as Chair of the Government Reform Committee’s Domestic Policy Subcommittee, Kucinich oversees major government agencies like the FDA and the Department of Agriculture. His tireless advocacy for animals makes Kucinich their most outspoken legislative champion on Capitol Hill. Betty Sutton—US Congresswoman (Ohio, 13th District)
Kucinich and his congressional colleague in Ohio, Betty Sutton, have at least two things in common: they are the only two herbivores on the Hill, and both are members of the Congressional Animal Protection Caucus, a bipartisan House organization dedicated to sponsoring and enacting animal protection legislation. A practicing vegetarian since the late 1990s, Sutton is an ardent animal advocate both at home in Akron (with her two rescued dogs, Cody and Bear) and in Washington, DC. Since being elected in 2006, Sutton has introduced bills to strengthen dog fighting laws and prohibit the slaughter of wild horses, and co-sponsored numerous other animal welfare measures, such as bills to exclude downed cows from being killed for food, ensure accurate labeling of fur products, and reinstate the ban on violent crush videos. Jamie Raskin—Maryland State Senator (20th District)
In April 2009, State Senator Jamie Raskin pledged to go meatless for Takoma Park’s first-ever Try Veg Week—and he’s remained an enthusiastic vegetarian ever since. Always seeking ways to effectively promote environmentalism in his district, Raskin saw this dietary experiment as a way of encouraging constituents to go green through sustainable eating. Asked by VegNews what convinced him to stick with vegetarianism over the long haul, Raskin replied that it made him feel better both physically and ecologically because “I’ve seen what the poultry industry has done to Chesapeake Bay, and I’m glad I’m not to be implicated personally in the continuing contamination of our most precious estuary by virtue of eating chicken nuggets every day.” Raskin now hopes national politicians will someday pass a resolution promoting Try Veg Week for the entire country. Jim Beall, Jr.—California Assemblyman (24th District)
A former star tackle on his high school football team, Jim Beall may look like he routinely scarfs down steaks at every meal, but no—he’s been meatless since 1993. In fact, this San Jose Democrat with high ratings from PawPac and other animal lobby groups told me he’s “morally, philosophically, and spiritually a vegetarian because (he doesn’t) want to harm other sentient beings.” One of Beall’s many political interests is food policy issues, and as Chair of the Committee on Human Services, he’s committed to enhancing low-income residents’ access to fresh fruits and vegetables. For instance, Beall has been instrumental in ensuring that people on government assistance can use food credits at farmers’ markets (with a 30-percent discount incentive), and was honored last year by the Stampy Awards for streamlining the application process to state-supported food programs. Sophie Maxwell—San Francisco Supervisor (10th District)
In April 2010, San Francisco, California became the nation’s first major metropolis to adopt a Meat-Free Mondays resolution that encourages grocery stores and schools to offer more plant-based options. Spearheading this innovative initiative was Supervisor Sophie Maxwell, a vegetarian for 40 years who has also helped the school district combat juvenile obesity and supported programs aimed at increasing healthy plant-based eating among communities of color. She also offers other progressive proposals for promoting locally-grown produce in the Bay Area, like transforming city-owned land into community gardens. “As a vegetarian, I am acutely sensitive to the negative impacts our society’s eating habits have on health, the environment and farm animals,” she told me. “And as a public official, I want people to know that they can feel better, conserve natural resources, and reduce animal suffering by eating less meat.” Last but not least: You!
To paraphrase President Lincoln (from the Gettysburg Address), the cornerstone of our democracy is government of, by, and for the people. This means we citizens not only get to choose our own leaders by voting, but also run for public office if we so desire. It’s therefore up to us to get more of our number elected, and one way to increase the chances of that happening is by hitting the campaign trail ourselves. So if you’re an ambitious, civic-minded vegetarian or vegan with the hunger to run for office, win an electoral race, and create public policy, then go for it. "
FASHION POLICE,https://vegnews.com/2010/10/fashion-police,"OCTOBER 2, 2010","Karolina Babczynska and Adam Wallace are planning their wedding for next fall. The handsome vegan couple, both represented by Ford Models, met through the fashion industry. In search of an idyllic, natural setting, they perked up at the suggestion of an upstate New York animal sanctuary as a colorful backdrop to their autumn nuptials. What better way to celebrate than in a captivating, compassionate environment, and to share a lifestyle that’s not often looked highly upon by New York City’s fashion elite? Vegan Supermodels?
When the winter collections hit the runways, it’s overwhelming how much wool, leather, down, and fur is showcased. Babczynska and Wallace both refuse to model fur. The unfortunate truth is that refusing to work with all animal products would mean they’d be out of jobs. The fashion world is not the most welcoming to an ethical lifestyle, nor is it the most logical terrain to navigate as an activist with ethical standards. Therein exist two conundrums: What should cold-climate dwelling, ethically stylish individuals wear from October through March? And what can you do from within the industry to make change for animals and ecosystems? To ignite change from within, you have to make short-term compromises in exchange for long-term goals. A model who refuses 95 percent of jobs is a model with no connections, mainstream recognition, or clout to make change. In fact, supermodels Cindy Crawford, Claudia Schiffer, Elle Macpherson, and Naomi Campbell have long since abandoned their 1990’s anti-fur stance in exchange for high-paying campaigns. As a response to these problems, Pinnacle was born. Pinnacle addresses an issue that the animal-rights movement has been fighting for three decades: the fur industry. Designers and artists are reinventing the iconic No-Fur pin in their personal style.  Since Pinnacle launched earlier this year, designers including John Bartlett and Stella McCartney, musician Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, and legendary artist Peter Max have come on board. In addition to the celebrity contributors, Babczynska and Wallace became an integral part of Pinnacle, acting as spokesmodels. Unlike their wishy-washy colleagues, these two vegan beauties won’t be selling out. Who cares about fashion?
It’s understandable why many activists discount the fashion industry altogether. It typically highlights the worst parts of our culture: It prays on our insecurities; it caters to the wealthy, powerful, and genetically unique; it perpetuates materialism; and it sets unrealistic beauty standards. It’s also notorious for committing some of the worst labor abuses. Many of the most commonly used fabrics such as wool, leather, and conventional cotton are directly causing environmental catastrophes and unimaginable human and non-human suffering. Despite its faults, fashion is a powerful form of visual communication that allows those who understand its dialect to climb the hierarchy and use it as a tool for social influence. Like most industries with shiny public relations and advertising campaigns, the aim is to make money and maintain the status quo for those in power. But like most industries that create a discourse, the tools can be appropriated to reach those under its spell with a subversive message. Fashion trends are like radio waves, and any message can be carried out to listeners. The danger in animal activists just brushing over the industry’s blatant sexism, vanity, and cruelty lies in an underestimation of how culturally relevant and influential fashion is. To outsiders, the fashion industry is a beautiful fortress—an attractive succession of new products intended to fulfill our desires. The actual production methodology, decision-making, and distribution of power and wealth within that fortress is intentionally obstructed by a wall built for war: a multi-billion dollar advertising initiative that preys upon our subconscious desires to be more sexually attractive, cool, and powerful. Even most insiders are under the spell of their predecessors, believing fashion is just an art form with a huge and popular demand among consumers. They seek no reason beyond the rationalization that people like certain types of clothing, and they fail miserably when it comes to accountability. Who’s Playing?
The mainstream fashion industry consists of far too many people who worship the iconography of the “rebel,” believing it to be cool. In fact, perpetuating so many mainstream problems our society faces couldn’t be further from revolution. Take the leather jacket, for example: It’s one of the most celebrated symbols of rebel-cool, yet it’s tied directly to livestock production, a mainstream industry. Even “vegetable-tanned leather,” a term with a very eco-friendly ring to it, is still part of the greatest cause of global warming. How about wool? With nearly 1 billion domestic sheep, the impact of breeding so many animals takes a huge toll on ecosystems that wool, organic or not, can’t really be called “sustainable.” Never mind the ethical implications of how horribly the sheep are treated. The true fashion iconoclasts who are redefining cool, and reinvigorating the lost meaning of dressing like a dissident are quickly gaining ground, and they are doing so with vegan materials. John Bartlett, a renowned, award-winning designer, sits on the Council of Fashion Designers Board of Directors, alongside the most influential names in fashion. He has been an advocate for shelter dogs for years, hosting adoption events at his New York City store, and basing his logo on his three-legged rescue pup, Tiny Tim. This year, Bartlett transitioned to an ethical vegan lifestyle, which promises to affect his future collections, beginning with spring and summer 2012. What happened to Bartlett, Babczynska, and Wallace that doesn’t happen to other designers and models? That is a question Bartlett asks himself as he begins to explore his options in ethical textiles. Things are shifting and people are talking, but do not be fooled—the fur mafia has noticed and is making a heavily funded effort to maintain their cool. Furriers spend millions courting young designers, flying them to Europe where they are wined and dined. They’re given free “materials” (dead animals) to work with, free training, and enough fur to fill their runway shows. It’s difficult for a struggling designer to say no, especially when so many fashion magazines practically require young designers to use fur in their collections in order to get attention. There are no vegan or sustainable fabrics companies offering similar experiences for designers, and the affect this has is a slow trickle-down acceptance of fur. There is a new breed of designers making waves, armed with cutting-edge, sustainable, and cruelty-free textiles, who aren’t afraid of challenging the dismal doctrine set by the industry’s past. By the time Babczynska and Wallace are married, in their cruelty-free tux and gown, wrapped in sustainable fall jackets and walking in fair-labor, leather-free shoes, a profound resistance within the fashion industry will be born, and we can all be a part of it.

APPLE PICKING GUIDE,https://vegnews.com/2010/9/apple-picking-guide,"SEPTEMBER 26, 2010","One sunny October afternoon a few years ago, my roommates and I headed out into the brisk fall air to have our hand at a classic autumnal activity: apple picking. At an apple orchard in rural Missouri, we each paid five dollars for large plastic bags and subsequently all the apples we could cram into said bags. After an afternoon of climbing trees and plucking perfectly ripe little beauties, the five of us headed home with what felt like close to 200 apples. 
What we had on our hands was an ample apple harvest, either a prelude for imminent waste, or a chance to combine two economic recession resolutions—buying in bulk and in-sourcing—into one golden-apple solution. We exercised buying in bulk by picking out own, which gave us more apples for less money. In-sourcing is the economist’s technical term for do-it-yourself, and we were about to DIY our way out of our apple abundance. To handle the numerous apples you’re sure to enjoy this autumn, VN’s compiled these handy resources for keeping your apple harvest, whether from the orchard or the supermarket, bearing fruit all fall.  Refreshing and Raw
Eating apples fresh is one of the most delicious ways to enjoy them, and also ensuree that you’re getting all their plentiful nutrients—such as fiber and vitamin C—and apples boast an uncanny ability to build your immune system and combat upcoming winter colds. Apples in salads add a surprising sweetness and crunch—try an Apple and Raisin Salad, Apple Fennel Salad, or apple, sunflower seed, and coconut salad. Apple salads with hearty grains are another way to get the fall effect, such as Couscous Salad, Barley Fruit Salad, or a delicious winter rice salad. And then of course, there’s the old apples and peanut butter stand-by routine, which has the added bonus of extra protein. Baked to Perfection
Using apples in baked goods makes for sweet, amazing desserts or breakfast breads that scream autumn. Hearty and sweet strudel, Apple Dumplings, and Apple Cobbler are all sure crowd-pleasers on either a chilly afternoon or a special occasion. Spice breads, Cocoa Apple Cakes, or apple cupcakes are melt-in-your-mouth ways to put the apples to good use. For a sweet way to start the day, go for apple pancakes, apple crepes, apple and cranberry oatmeal, or Mini-Apple Cinnamon Coffee Cake. Apples also make amazing muffins—such as zucchini-carrot-apple muffins, Apple Crunch Muffins, or Apple and Walnut Muffins. And you can simply bake apples into Crispy Apple Skins or dishes such as baked apples that go great with dairy-free vanilla ice cream. Saved for Later
Aside from canning, there are other alternatives to making your apple bounty last longer. Mulled Cran-Apple Cider is a fall treat that cannot be beat and a veg-alternative to eggnog at upcoming holiday parties. Apple butter is perfect for spreading on breads and biscuits. Apple sauce is another super simple way to put a lot of apples to good use. And of course, you can always make crisp, refreshing apple juice.  Enjoy the apple and autumn season!  "

AR ACTIVIST (AND RACE CAR DRIVER) LEILANI MÜNTER,https://vegnews.com/2010/9/ar-activist-and-race-car-driver-leilani-munter,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2010","Veg professional racecar driver Leilani Münter has had a busy past year. When she first saw The Cove almost one year ago, she turned to husband Craig Davidson and announced, “We have to go there.” There was Taiji, Japan, and Münter has just returned from her first trip to Taiji to raise awareness and protest the dolphin hunt. Intelligent woman that she is, Münter knew that proposing an alternative way for the people of Taiji to survive sustainably was just as important as ceasing the unnecessary dolphin blood spill, and she was in good company with Save Japan Dolphins and The Cove’s Ric O’Barry. VegNews was able to catch up with Münter to hear of her incredible efforts for animals abroad. VegNews: How did your involvement protesting the dolphin hunt in Taiji begin?
Leilani Münter: I think the second that I saw the movie I knew I wanted to go to Japan and so, there we were 10 months later, in Taiji. I met Ric [O’Barry] through mutual friends who connected me through email to Louie Psihoyos (director of The Cove) and Ric, and as soon as we found out that [O’Barry] was going back to Taiji, that became a priority for us to be there with him. I have a feeling this is now going to be an annual trip until we finally have that party on the beach to celebrate that the dolphins are safe. VN: What happened when you got to Japan?
LM: Ric actually didn’t go to Taiji—there were a lot of threats from right-wing nationalist groups—so we met Ric in Tokyo, and that’s where we delivered the Save Japan Dolphins petition that contained 1.7 million signatures from 151 different countries since [The Cove] came out. I was one of the people who got to go with Ric to the embassy to deliver this petition, and then after Tokyo my husband and I went down to Taiji along with some of the other activists. VN: What was your impression of Taiji?
LM: It was very interesting. We were met by police right when we got there, there were people following us around, and we did have a right-wing nationalist come up and scream at us to leave. It was just really kind of eerie being there, because Taiji is very beautiful—the water is crystal clear and warm and it looks like turquoise—it’s just gorgeous. So it really is a strange dynamic to see it in person because it is so beautiful and then at the same time, this awful thing is happening there. We actually got footage of the fishermen setting up the cove, and in the cove there were no dolphins because they’ve been capturing dolphins and then choosing the ones they want for captivity. The problem is that as long as the activists are there then they aren’t killing the dolphins, but of course all of us have jobs and lives and none of us can camp out in Taiji for six months. What we’re trying to do is get a whole team of people to Taiji, and be there for the whole killing season, which is September through to March, because that’s really what needs to happen. If it’s our presence there that’s deterring the killing then we can’t just be there for a week from September 1. That’s the challenge, and for that reason I’m going back to Taiji in a couple of weeks. VN: Do you foresee any way that Taiji could survive economically without the hunt?
LM: Definitely. I think if they stopped killing the dolphins and were willing to change those boats over into boats that would take us out to see the dolphins alive, or take us out to go scuba diving, I really think it could have a future as a tourist destination. It could really help economics in Taiji, and because it is a small group of fisherman that are doing this, if the fisherman are taking us out on scuba diving or on dolphin-watching boats then they will make money, but also the hotels and the restaurants will make money. It would be good for the town as a whole. VN: How did the fishermen and residents of Taiji react to your presence?
LM: There were definitely negative reactions. There was a day when we went down to where they actually process the dolphin meat, and just across the street from the fishermen complex there’s the big grocery store, and immediately the manager was in my face, telling me to turn off my camera and following us around the store, and there were fishermen snapping photos of me. I just pointed my camera right back and took pictures—I was being polite but I was just saying if you’re going to film me, I’m going to film you. We tried to talk to them about mercury poisoning, and then we had one right wing nationalist who was very upset and came down the road with bullhorns, saying “f*** off movie The Cove,” “apologize for Hiroshima,” and he was very aggressive. He approached me, and he was very angry and yelling and telling us we were liars. But we talked to him, he spoke English, so the dialogue went on for awhile, and by the end of the conversation he apologized and by the end he welcomed us to Taiji and left. Everyone was kind of on alert because they thought that Sea Shepherd was with us. Sea Shepherd has a bad reputation in the community, and has really been vilified, so they thought we were there with them to cut the nets. We explained that we saw The Cove, and we think Taiji is beautiful and we would be willing to take vacations in Taiji if they were willing to turn the dolphin boats into whale-watching and scuba diving boats. We really need people and volunteers to help us. It’s the only way. It’s been a lot better lately than it has been in the past for Ric, and I think he’s more positive than he’s ever been before. Leilani Münter will be racing later this month in the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) Series at Kansas Speedway. She will be racing the #59 Operation Free Dodge and will proudly be carrying a “Save Japan Dolphins” logo on her racecar and racing suit. She will also carry images of solar panels and wind turbines on her car. Photo Credit: Phil Cavali, TheHotLap.com "

HOW TO TAILGATE LIKE A VEGAN PRO,https://vegnews.com/2010/9/how-to-tailgate-like-a-vegan-pro,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2010","It’s a shame that the time between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve has a monopoly on the term “the holidays,” because those of us for whom college never really ended (in our hearts, at the very least) or who are all but fanatic about football, the real holidays start at the first signs of fall and last well past January 1. We’re referring to football season, or, more appropriately, tailgating season. It’s the time of year when we don our goofiest fan apparel, sing fight songs with pride, and deck every hall with the fiercest of team colors. No matter what team you root for, we’ve got the game plan you need to score at your vegan tailgate. Kegs, Not Eggs
True, non-fair-weather fans rise with the sun on game day, and the brisk fall air makes for the perfect time to throw a kegs-not-eggs party. At morning tailgates, you want to be sure to fill your troops with enough sustenance to last the day—accomplished with dishes such as tofu scramble, Savory Biscuits and gravy, sausage breakfast casserole, or roasted potatoes. Breads and muffins are excellent for sharing with large groups, so the night before whip up some Banana Bread, a Chocolate Chip Loaf, or, for something especially autumnal, Date, Walnut, Pumpkin and Banana Oat Muffins. And no kegs-not-eggs party is complete without mimosas! The All-Star Tailgate
Football and tailgating brings people together—it’s a time for celebration with like-minded people, whether the common ground be veganism, a shared hatred for the enemy team, or both. Take advantage of the communal atmosphere of a tailgate to introduce fellow fans to new vegan eats. When planning your menu—and always plan ahead before the big game—choose foods that won’t melt if it gets hot, that are easily transported and set up, and that can be effortlessly devoured. Dips are a surefire way to please a crowd, such as salsa, spinach dip, or veggie dip. Grilling is always a tailgating must, so break out the veggie kabobs (which you can marinate the night before) and vegan hamburgers or veggie dogs, and don’t forget the ever-important Chili Dog Sauce. Also great for sharing, consider black-bean casserole or a hearty chili. As far as dessert goes, don’t over think it—Game Day Football Cookies, sugar cookies with team-colored frosting, or brownies are all crowd pleasers. And of course, the reason why tailgating was born: beer. Bud Light, Natural Light, Miller Lite, and The Original Blue Moon are all cruelty-free favorites that will you send you right back to the glory of your college days. A good tailgater knows that just as important as the menu at a tailgate are the games played. There are always the old favorites of bags and washers (toss bags or washers into an object), and, naturally, throwing around a cruelty-free football of your own.

BILL CLINTON ON VEG DIET,https://vegnews.com/2010/9/bill-clinton-on-veg-diet,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2010","In a recent interview with Willow Bay for The Huffington Post and Yahoo News, President Bill Clinton revealed that he has been following a plant-based diet. Clinton told Bay that he has lost nearly 20 pounds in an attempt to be healthy for his future grandchildren, and has done so through exercise and staying away from animal products. Clinton said that since 1986, 82 percent of people who have tried plant-based diets have seen their bodies “heal themselves,” from ailments such as arterial blockage. Clinton says he’d like to see if he could be one of those people, though he said he’ll need to stick with it for a few more months to know for sure. "
REBRANDING HFCS,https://vegnews.com/2010/9/rebranding-hfcs,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2010","The US Corn Refiners Association (CRA) has launched a campaign to rebrand high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as “corn sugar.” In recent years, HFCS has faced attacks from anti-obesity and healthy-eating advocates, citing research that HFCS leads to weight gain and increased cancer risk, among other health problems. The CRA has responded by claiming that HFCS is no worse for the body than sugar. The sweetener became popular in the 1970s as an alternative to sugar because it is cheaper and increases the shelf life of foods. The Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve the name change.

CHATTING WITH HUGH JACKMAN’S VEGAN GURU,https://vegnews.com/2010/9/chatting-with-hugh-jackmans-vegan-guru,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2010","Brendan Brazier, vegan professional Ironman triathlete and author of Thrive: The Vegan Nutrition Guide to Optimal Performance in Sports and Life, made celebrity headlines when Page Six of the New York Post reported that Hugh Jackman has been considering going vegan as a result of Brazier’s influence. Jackman wrote the foreword to the new edition of Thrive, raving about how great he felt eating veg and using Brazier’s Vega Supplements. Jackman writes “there is every chance that I will be [a vegan] by the time you read [this].” Though the jury is still out on Jackman’s veganism, Brazier has been brought on board to work with Jackman as he beefs up for X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2, which will be released in 2011. VegNews caught up with Brendan Brazier to get the scoop on his upcoming work with Jackman. VegNews: Congratulations on spreading the plant-based diet to celebrities like Hugh Jackman. How did Jackman initially hear about your book and Vega?
Brendan Brazier: He got my contact info from his trainer, Don Scott, after he read [Thrive], and he emailed and said that he’d been using Vega and he really liked it. He said that he had been incorporating some of the ideas, and that the book showed him that he actually could be an athlete and athletic while eating plant-based, and possibly work up to being vegan, which is his goal. VN: What happened after he got in contact with you?
BB: In the past he had eaten a lot of chicken for his role, but he took a lot of Vega, too. It turned out I was going to New York City so he said “well why don’t you just come over,” so I went over to his place and we had a great chat and he told me how he was trying out veganism for environmental and health reasons and to set a good example for his kids. It’s not just for his own career anymore, which he wrote in the forward. He was listing the reasons why he was interested in Thrive, and he was concerned for the environment. That’s definitely something that he was aware of, and wanted to help instead of hurt. VN: So how is Jackman planning on continuing to implement the ideas in Thrive?
BB: He has a great trainer in Don Scott, who is not vegan but is well aware of the benefits of being vegan, and he takes Vega. He’s going to be training Hugh again for the upcoming movie, and I’ll be helping with the nutrition program. I’ll be making nutrition suggestions about what he can eat to pack on the muscle—instead of chicken—so and I don’t know if he’ll do 100-percent plant-based, but he’s certainly going to incorporate elements of it. That’s our plan—to do as much plant-based as possible and, ideally, completely vegan. VN: Do you think he will be willing to go completely vegan?
BB: He said in the forward that he’s been feeling really good. That’s the thing that gives him hope for going all the way, because he does feel really great. And he’s been eating some of the recipes from Thrive, so of course I hope that he will continue to be able to pack on muscle in the same way. The studio needs him ready to go, and if he’s not the size that he needs to be, that stalls the whole production. But I’m very confident that we can get him where he needs to be for the Wolverine role. There’s a very good chance [he’ll go vegan], and even if he doesn’t completely, a large amount of his diet will be. And I think that’s huge, I mean he’s not going to be eating all this chicken; he’s going to build up naturally. What I’m really excited about is that I think it’s going to draw in a whole new audience that would know nothing about it—they wouldn’t even know what vegan is—a lot of teenage kids who love his Wolverine character and want to eat like him. And there is that important new demographic of ages 14 to 30 for men—a lot of these guys eat whatever they think is going to make them big. I love that this is not at all preaching to the converted. I think Hugh’s work with this will be phenomenally influential, and I think he’ll look great in the movie. I’m completely confident that he’ll be able to do it and he’ll get as big and possibly even more toned than in the past. I think everyone’s going to benefit from this. Brendan Brazier has new Vega Sport products to be released, as well as a new book with nearly 200 recipes and a large section focusing on the case for the environmental veganism, all due out in spring, 2011.

EARLY FALL FOODS TO ENJOY BEFORE FIRST FROST,https://vegnews.com/2010/9/early-fall-foods-to-enjoy-before-first-frost,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2010","No matter what part of the country you call home, the time when the hot, sticky nights of summer shift to the more mild, cool days of autumn is always a welcomed transition. And like how the colors of the leaves and cozy sweaters become rich and warm in September, so too do the gorgeous aesthetics of the food we eat this time of year. Instead of allowing a peach to travel thousands of miles to your plate when its not available locally for another nine months, take pleasure in the fruits and vegetables that are ripe in the late-summer, early fall season. There are infinite opportunities for fresh salads, warm soups, and everything in between with the September harvest. Farmers everywhere are finishing up the rich summer yield and turning to the fall harvest. From eggplant to green beans to okra to squashes, so much is available this time of year. Ed Armas, who runs harvesting and packaging at Capay Organics Farm in northern California, says the farm is currently enjoying a long list of produce progressing from the summer vegetables into a more autumnal bounty. This includes bok choy, arugula, fennel, kale, radishes, beets, melons, and more. Soon, Armas expects to see black beans, cabbages, and squashes added to the list. Jenny and Heather Goldberg of Spork Foods, a gourmet vegan food service in Los Angeles, take advantage of the cornucopia of fresh foods at their disposal this time of year. They say that late summer makes the move from “light and refreshing recipes that beat the heat to stronger, satisfying dishes, like roasted vegetables or slow-cooked stews.” Lemon cucumbers, “more fun to use than a standard cuke,” the Goldbergs say, are in season and can be used in typical cucumber fashion, such as in sandwiches, salads, or by themselves. And this time of year, soak up the lingering flavors of summer one last time, indulging in foods such as figs, which are only available a little longer. The Goldbergs use figs to “sweeten savory dishes like seitan, in salads…or stuffing them with cashew cheese or home-made tofu ricotta.” With all the leafy greens that are available, it’s the ideal time to enjoy hearty salads, matched with brown rice or quinoa. So much of what’s fresh in the markets right now is stand-alone delicious, especially when freshly picked, that not many additional spices or flavorings are needed. If you are in search of an additional punch to your in-season recipes, go after fresh herbs. The Goldbergs recommend any “interesting types of basil or mint, like opal basil or chocolate mint, which taste fantastic.” The ladies also say that once the weather gets cooler, Ceylon cinnamon on roasted sweet potatoes or baked cobblers and pies adds for something “a little spicier and sweeter than cassia cinnamon, and will give your dishes some amazing oomph!” And to pair with your bountiful salads, the Goldbergs recommend blending roasted peppers, olive oil, sea salt, pepper, mustard, and maple syrup to make an amazing autumnal dressing. To find fresh, in-season, local produce, look no further than your community farmers’ market. Don’t have the time, or would rather spend your weekend mornings sleeping in? The Goldbergs recommend joining a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) alliance and having produce ready for pick-up or delivered right to your door. No matter how you get your greens (and purples, and oranges, and reds), just be sure to savor the season before the snow and frost set in! "

Singer asserts that, in spite of widely believed myths, fish do feel pain, as researcher Victory Braithwaite evidences in her book Do Fish Feel Pain?

The piglet was initially rescued by a man who was driving behind the transport truck that the pig fell from, and cared for the pig’s road rash wounds at his apartment, before the piglet found his permanent home at Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, NY. Farm Sanctuary named the piglet after Harper to acknowledge his continued work in farm animal advocacy. "
ANIMAL PROTEIN INCREASES DEATHS,https://vegnews.com/2010/9/animal-protein-increases-deaths,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2010","A new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine shows that animal-based proteins and fats are associated with higher mortality rates. The study, which followed more than 100,000 people over the course of 20 to 26 years, showed that heavy consumption of animal proteins increase mortality rates, including deaths related to cardiovascular and cancer issues. Conversely, lower mortality rates were associated with low carbohydrate and high protein diets consisting of mostly plant-based fats and proteins. The findings also echo previous studies that have shown the link between red and processed meat with colorectal and lung cancer. "

"REMEMBERING DONALD WATSON, THE FATHER OF VEGANISM",https://vegnews.com/2010/9/remembering-donald-watson-the-father-of-veganism,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2010","September 2 would have marked the 100th birthday of the “father of veganism,” Donald Watson, who passed away at the age of 95. While Watson wasn’t the first to prescribe a wholly plant-based diet, it was he, along with his wife Dorothy, who coined the word “vegan” in 1944. He founded the Vegan Society, the world’s first organization of its kind, signaling the start of a movement for compassionate, cruelty-free living. In honor of Watson’s birthday, VN presents a portion of Publisher Joseph Connelly’s 2005 interview with the man who gave the vegan movement its moniker. VegNews: You were vegetarian for almost 20 years before going vegan. What made you go vegan?
Donald Watson: All our theories told us [that animal products] were obviously produced by cruelty. I knew how milk arrived at the doorstep. And where eggs came from. The argument of vegetarians, of course, was that in order to get steak you had to kill an animal. In order to get an egg or a glass of milk you hadn’t to kill an animal. But if you produce those dairy products on a massive scale, then the theory isn’t true that you don’t have to kill an animal. VN: What does veganism mean, from the person who defined it?
DW: Well it certainly started as a milk issue. That was a great issue, even more than eggs. We had to solve the milk problem. And then it soon took over to include the whole diet—then, of course later, all the animal products that people use. The biggest industry in the world is animal exploitation, which is the one thing that veganism is opposing. Not just farming, but everything else—medicines, vivisection, everything that comes from animals. I think man is biologically not a carnivore or a parasite. I’m thinking particularly of milk drinking. We’ve got more than 500 different mammals throughout the world and man is the only one who takes milk throughout life. It’s only man who is capable of [this kind of exploitation]. VN: Taking veganism beyond diet, tell me your thoughts about wearing fur or hunting and fishing.
DW: Well veganism covers, it leads, the whole of the animal-welfare movement. There is a difference, obviously, between a laboratory animal that’s just being torn to pieces and someone giving little children a donkey ride. They’re so different and yet they’re both animal exploitation in a way, aren’t they? But I, as a propagandist, wouldn’t [protest] the donkey giving the little child a ride because the opponent would think you were just around the bend, so I just keep off that and go for the strong points. VN: How would you like to be remembered?
DW: I thought, “When Joseph comes into the room this morning, I’ll say to him, ‘Look, I’m not obese. I don’t have bags under my eyes. I still got hair.’” And I thought, “No, that’s boasting, isn’t it?” Fate has a cruel way of dealing with boasters. You know, when the Vegan Society started, the population of the world was around two billion. It now exceeds [in 2005] six billion. Alongside this explosion is the second man-made explosion of purposely-bred animals to feed him. Some people throughout the ages have grasped these messages haven’t they? And it’s one of the mysteries of genetics how [a] few of us in the 20th century, born in orthodox settings with no one to influence us, managed to arrive at the same conclusion, or to see the same messages, that some of the ancient Greeks did. The theory is if we live on pure foods and pure thoughts and all the right ideas we become more receptive. And [most] people, the great mass of people, they’re just living. Now they’re not going to be spoken of in 2,000 years like the old Greeks. They’re just going to live and die. "

The group is welcoming anyone to participate in the ride or to contribute to its cause on its donation page. “Having been to a handful of sanctuaries and having the pleasure of knowing some people who run them, work at them, and volunteer at them, I’m of the opinion that sanctuaries are the best outreach tool we have,” organizer Josh Hooten said.

"
GUIDE TO REPLACING EGGS IN EVERY RECIPE,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/guide-to-replacing-eggs-in-every-recipe,"AUGUST 29, 2010","Massive egg recalls due to salmonella contamination? Disgusting. Rising egg prices and industry scrutiny? Deserved. Supporting the egg industry isn’t worth your money or morals, especially when alternative options abound. If the risk of salmonella poisoning isn’t a convincing enough reason to swear off eggs, consider the inhumane treatment of hens on factory farms. While going cage-free is a step in the right direction, cutting out eggs completely is the best decision for both health and the environment. With ingenious bakers developing delicious vegan versions of traditional favorites, herbivores can enjoy eggless foods like never before. From flax seeds to tofu omelets, the innovative world of egg substitution is well within reach.
 
Baking
Egg replacing in baking can be a lot more creative than relying on boxed egg replacer. When veganizing muffins, cookies, and cakes, a good go-to egg substitute is ground flax seeds. Cheap and nutritious, when blended with a little bit of water—three tablespoons of water to one tablespoon of ground flax yields about one “egg”—flax creates a mixture that binds baking ingredients together. Super Moist Chocolate Chip Muffins, Caramel Apple Cookies, and Chocolate Cupcakes with Coconut Fudge Frosting all use the flax method.
 
Soy yogurt is another useful egg replacer (1/4 cup equals one “egg”), as it can help add moisture to baked goods. Try making your own Berry Yogurt, which you can repurpose as an egg replacer in Blackberry-Almond Scones. When making banana breads and other cakes containing bananas, the fruit itself has binding qualities and can stand in as an egg replacer, for instance in these healthy zucchini carrot apple muffins.
 
Eggless Brunching
Fancy a full vegan breakfast? With Smokey Maple Hickory Fake Bacon and vegan fried egg, the normally artery-clogging favorites can be yours. Groundbreaking veganized egg dishes abound with fancy favorites such as Tomato-Zucchini Frittata, Tofu Benedict, Saturday’s Omelette, and even deviled eggs (aka potato angels) bringing some class to the brunch table. More everyday options such as eggless Blueberry Pancakes join Egg McVegans for kid-friendly breakfasts, and don’t forget Mock Steak and Eggs for faux-meat lovers.
 
If you don’t already have a favorite tofu scramble recipe, experiment with a spicy salsa tofu scramble and breakfast scramble. Favorite add-ins can include extra garlic, shiitake mushrooms, and fresh herbs. For a special twist, add in half a teaspoon of kala namak—also called black salt despite being pink in hue—which adds a sulfuric taste similar to eggs. For those who miss the taste and smell of eggs, you’ll find the resemblance unbelievable! Dig out your May+June 2010 VegNews (or grab a back issue) for a garbanzo-bean flour-based frittata recipe that uses kala namak by Veganize It! columnist Allison Rivers Samson. Happy breakfasting, brunching, and baking! "
SANCTUARY STORIES FROM ANIMAL CAMP,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/sanctuary-stories-from-animal-camp,"AUGUST 29, 2010","It’s virtually impossible not to melt over any inspiring and adorable story about quirky rescued animals at farm sanctuaries. In fact, it’s these anecdotes and animal sanctuary visits that can often be the final factor in someone’s decision to go vegan. Kathy Stevens, founder of Catskill Animal Sanctuary (CAS) in New York’s Hudson Valley, shares her experiences in her previous book, Where the Blind Horse Sings: Love and Healing at an Animal Sanctuary. Her new book, Animal Camp: Lessons in Love and Hope from Rescued Farm Animals, includes similar heart-warming tales, though this time Stevens also rounds up a few very special animals and keeps them together on the grounds of her partner’s home near the sanctuary. She opted to give the group a home away from others in order to observe them thriving and interacting. Veg or not, if you have ever been curious about just who turkeys, pigs, and cows are when they’re in an environment where they truly thrive, you’ll be touched by the stories about Barbie the hen, Rambo the ram, Norma Jean the turkey, Noah the stallion, and Claude the pig. VegNews managed to briefly pull Stevens out of the barn to ask a few questions about Animal Camp, which will be released September 8, 2010.
 
VegNews: Your new book Animal Camp picks up in the same vein as Where the Blind Horse Sings, with emotional stories about animals at CAS. Is there anything you’ve learned about the animals at CAS since the previous book?
Kathy Stevens: Like Blind Horse, Animal Camp shares the journeys of several animals from deprivation and certain death to healing. The stories are remarkable not only for what the animals endured, but also for who the animals become when they heal. It’s the transformation of broken spirits that continues to be the greatest joy of this work, and sharing those stories is deeply and personally rewarding.
 
The book is different in that it includes very personal essays on the lives endured by agribusiness victims, and in the degree that it asks readers to stop eating animals. I hope readers will know that I ask them with love and encouragement—but I still ask them!
 
VN: What was the response like to your last book?
KS: The response to Blind Horse was really positive—it’s still in print and the great feedback continues! Plenty of the folks who read this book will be like so many people we all know—folks who call themselves animal lovers despite the fact that their lifestyle choices suggest they’ve never really considered animals other than dogs and cats. I hope the book will motivate them to take the next step in their own journeys of compassion.
 
VN: You were a high school teacher for some time before opening CAS. How did your teaching experience influence your work with CAS? Do you have any youth education programs?
KS: We sure do! We offer both on- and off-site programs for kids, and tailor the programs to the ages and backgrounds of the kids. So there’s tremendous variation in both content and length—from a single classroom visit from a CAS humane educator, to a multi-day experience on CAS grounds. We also just piloted Camp Kindness, a humane education program for kids six to 12, and have received amazing feedback. Parents are telling us they want an adult Camp Kindness, so we’re exploring that option for 2011.
 
VN: Tell me about the Compassionate Cuisine program. Are there any other new programs in the works?
KS: At CAS, our goal is to awaken the compassion in every visitor—to stir them to act. When they’re surrounded by disarmingly happy animals acting in ways one doesn’t expect farm animals to act, emotions get called up, and assumptions are questioned. Compassionate Cuisine then makes it easy for them to take the next step by showing them how to change their diets without sacrificing taste. Our inaugural season featured popular vegan cooking classes such as “Classic Comfort Food,” our own organic garden (the soil is 100-percent composted animal poop), a blog, and cooking demonstrations at conferences and food festivals. The chef and I are hunkering down next week to finalize upcoming program offerings, so folks should keep checking our website for updates. "
TOFU AND SPINACH BURRITO,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/tofu-and-spinach-burrito,"AUGUST 29, 2010","Evol Burritos’ Tofu and Spinach Sauté is one of the tastiest things to come out of the VN freezer lately. These single-serving wraps don’t sacrifice flavor for convenience, making for a delicious, stress-free breakfast burrito or satisfying quick dinner. On top of their VN-approved taste, Evol takes care to craft wholesome wraps using organic and locally produced ingredients whenever possible. This savory sauté stars non-GMO, locally made tofu, spinach, rosemary and garlic-roasted potatoes, organic black beans, and housemade tomato salsa, wrapped in a whole-wheat tortilla. Oh, and did we mention it’s high in fiber and protein? Pan-fried, baked, or ’waved, we’re loving Evol’s vegan burritos. "
WARNING TO PROTECT DOGS,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/warning-to-protect-dogs,"AUGUST 29, 2010","California will be the first to include text in the state’s Driver Handbook that warns against leaving dogs locked in vehicles. The text will state that leaving dogs unattended in locked cars is against the law, and warns that penalties include up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500 if a dog dies or is hurt due to being left alone. The warning is a result of Assemblymember Anthony Portantino’s work with California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). “The DMV understood the need for providing animal safety information just as they provide educational information on leaving unattended children in vehicles,” Portantino said. Animals left in vehicles are often severely injured or killed by high temperatures in the vehicle. "

The film’s website, which includes a blog of Close’s meatless meals and experiences, also recognizes the impact of factory farming and the amount of animals killed for consumption. "

WILD HORSE ROUNDUPS CAMPAIGN,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/wild-horse-roundups-campaign,"AUGUST 26, 2010","A new campaign has been launched to bring light to the harmful nature of wild horse roundups. Citizens concerned with animal rights have been voicing opposition to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) regarding wild horse roundups—a practice that attempts to control the population of wild horses throughout the Great Plains. Roundups often lead to animal suffering, overrun adoption programs, and financial burdens for the BLM and taxpayers. In response, Madeline Pickens, founder of Saving America’s Mustangs, recently launched a campaign called Pony Express. Pickens has set a goal to collect 20,000 letters that urge President Obama, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, and BLM Director Robert Abbey to put an immediate moratorium on wild horse gatherings. "

The findings showed that in contrast to the high-income communities, which have many large supermarkets containing fresh produce, the lower-income neighborhoods have twice as many liquor stores, an abundance of meat products, and little to no access to organic produce. The study also showed that very few meat and dairy alternatives are available to lower-income communities, which is concerning due to the growing prevalence of lactose intolerance and dairy sensitivities.

HOW TO PLAN THE PERFECT VEGAN WEDDING,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/how-to-plan-the-perfect-vegan-wedding,"AUGUST 24, 2010","By now, we’ve all heard the rumors and facts concerning Chelsea Clinton’s “vegan” wedding. The story has been reported and re-reported to death—was it a vegan cake or did it contain upward of 500 eggs? Did the former President go veg for the big day or enjoy short ribs? The New York Times speculated in an Aug. 6 article if a vegetarian bride should adhere to the guidelines of her lifestyle or succumb to the demands of a meat-loving mother-in-law, begging the question: beef or tofu? Here at the VNHQ, we suffer from no such existential dilemma, as evidenced by our annual vegan weddings feature. We say, it’s your day to remember, and you’ve sat through enough family celebrations picking at the wilted green salad that acts as the only vegan offering. Celebrate your ethics on your day unabashedly with these handy vegan wedding solutions. Planning
Before you unleash your inner-bridezilla, realize that a vegan wedding requires the same steps of preparation as a non-vegan wedding, with only a little added research. Start by setting a budget—this will affect, though not determine, every other decision you make. Can you afford a caterer, a band, 50 or 200 guests? Once you know what you’re working with, create a tone and theme for your event. To help differentiate between what you like and what you don’t, seek out the guidance of a wedding planner. If you can’t find a vegan wedding planner, take the time to explain to the wedding planner the fundamentals of veganism and why it’s important to you—the more someone is on your side during this crazy time, the better. From there, there are a million decisions to be made, from finding a non-silk dress, to satin shoes without leather soles, to ensuring your calligrapher uses soy-based ink. All we can say is take a deep breath, and start early. Guests
Unless you’re planning an elopement (and if that’s the case, consider The Stanford Inn in Mendocino, Calif. for its famous eco-friendly events), you inevitably are going to deal with people who have never heard of, much less experienced, veganism. As a result, your parents might think it necessary to provide some non-vegan options for dinner. A wedding is an event shrouded in tradition and emotion, but this does not necessitate a meat-based gravy or stuffed chicken breasts as entrées. “Most couples use their wedding as an opportunity to show off how amazing vegan food can be to their non-vegan guests,” vegan event planner Karine Brighten, of Karine Brighten Events, says. It’s still a good idea to let guests know in advance that your wedding is vegan, perhaps in the save-the-date cards or wedding invitations. That way, any relatives who are bold enough to veer off the registry won’t surprise you with an enrollment in the cheese-of-the-month club. Caterers
Just as more restaurants throughout the country are offering vegan options, so are caterers opening their minds and culinary skills to vegan menus. Again, you might be lucky enough to find a vegan caterer, but if not, there are still many options a non-vegan caterer can provide. Bring suggested recipes when you meet. The food should be varied and interesting—anyone can sauté some vegetables. But on your wedding day you deserve a culinary masterpiece—with the restrictions of cooking for a mass amount of people in mind. As Ann Walker of Ann Walker Catering says: “We like the challenge. It keeps us working on new food preparations.” Another dinner option is looking to a vegan restaurant to supply the food for the event. Either way, don’t back down from a delicious vegan meal. Take the Cake
As Essell Hoenshell-Watson of Alternative Baker in New York says, “The wedding cake is an extremely intimate reflection of the couple.” Go after the vegan wedding cake of your dreams, one that describes your personality as a couple and reflects the mood of the event. This means finding the perfect flavor, which might require multiple cake testings. How tragic. Amanda Felt, owner of Black Sheep Bakery in Portland, says that some popular vegan cake flavors are chocolate with vanilla buttercream, lemon poppy seed, pumpkin and gingerbread in the fall, and Marion-berry filling, an Oregon favorite. Bunnie Cakes in Miami provides an alternative to the traditional three-tired white cake: a vegan cupcake display. Owner Mariana Cortez has made up to 600 cupcakes for a wedding before, giving a twist for vegan newbies. Whatever the baker, allow your wedding cake to be the sweet ending to your perfect vegan wedding, and don’t forget to take a piece home for your one year anniversary! Or, you know, later that night.

LAST COMIC STANDING’S MYQ KAPLAN JOKES WITH VN,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/last-comic-standings-myq-kaplan-jokes-with-vn,"AUGUST 22, 2010","Sure vegans save lives, live longer, and contribute to a greener earth. But apparently, we can be funny too. Throughout his career, vegan comedian Myq Kaplan has brought some much-needed humor to the meatless table. And on this past season of NBC’s Last Comic Standing, his smart humor and sharp wit was expanded into America’s living rooms. Though he did not take home the $250,000 grand prize, he did place in the top five, and has since gained immense popularity and extended his reach. Before the Last Comic Standing tour begins in September, Kaplan had a chance to chat with VegNews about veganism, the show, and all-around funny business. VegNews: How long have you been vegan? What made you first commit to the lifestyle?
Myq Kaplan: I’ve been vegan about eight years, and was vegetarian for maybe five years before that. I remember thinking in high school that eating animals seemed wrong, but they were delicious, so oh well, which is the way I believe a lot of humans think. But when I got to college, the dining halls had more variety, and I just decided to try giving up meat. Because there were so many more options I’d never had, it wasn’t like I was restricting myself, and I was glad for my beliefs to line up more with my actions. I went through a similar mindset-shifting process when I became vegan; I thought it might be too difficult (having to read labels or ask questions all the time), but figured why not give it a shot. So I did, and it’s been working so far. VN: Congratulations on your success on Last Comic Standing. How would you describe the experience?
MK: Thanks very much. It’s a surreal kind of thing, because competitions aren’t necessarily a natural part of comedy. In comedy, if you’re talented and work hard, everyone can succeed, whereas on this show only one person “wins.” But the rest of us get so much airtime and exposure to millions of people who wouldn’t have seen us otherwise, so getting as far as I did is a huge deal regardless. It was nerve-wracking week-to-week, but overall a rewarding experience. Though there was no reward of $250,000, which would have been nice, but I’m sure I’ll win the lottery someday anyway. No big VN: What was your relationship like with the other contestants? Did you ever discuss veganism with them?
MK: I’m pretty friendly with everyone on the show. I believe veganism comes up every so often, at mealtimes and the like. If people ask me questions, I answer them. I generally try not to force the issue at all, but if people are curious, I like providing reasonable amounts of information. VN: How do you think your vegan lifestyle is reflected in your comedy? How do you think the two intersect?
MK: I write jokes about things that I experience, and that certainly includes my dietary choices and my ethics in general. I think this aspect of who I am gives me a perspective that not a lot of other comedians have. I’m happy to be able to talk about the things that are important to me in ways that can be relatable, and ideally funny and insightful to the people who might not share the same views (which I know is where most people are coming from, so it’s always a welcome challenge to make my fringe viewpoint palatable to a carnivorous crowd.) VN: Do you think that by being on Last Comic Standing you’ve introduced more people to veganism?
MK: I think society is definitely becoming more aware of it regardless, maybe more on the coasts than in the middle. But if I’ve reached people who haven’t ever thought about it, then great. I know that some people have a knee-jerk reaction to the topic, as though anything a vegan says is going to be patronizing and disdainful to other lines of thinking, so I do my best to try and undercut that. I can generally just be myself and say the things I believe, and hope that people listen and understand. VN: What’s your favorite thing to eat on the road while touring?MK: While touring, I rarely cook. I like performing in cities such as San Francisco or Portland because they have really vibrant vegan restaurant scenes, and I’m a big fan of supporting such venues. Sometimes I’ll find myself in a place where the best I can do is a vegetable sandwich at Subway, or the local Chinese restaurant that hopefully exists, or a supermarket that sells fruit with no meat in it. VN: What are your plans after Last Comic Standing? How do you think it has propelled your career?
MK: My plans are to continue to do comedy, both touring the country and in New York City where I live. The show has let a lot of people know who I am, which should hopefully work in my favor. Also it’s opened a lot of doors for interviews with vegan magazines. Want to see Kaplan in action? Win two tickets to Myq Kaplan’s performance in San Francisco, Sept. 10, at The Warfield!

4 WAYS TO PROMOTE VEGANISM ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/4-ways-to-promote-veganism-on-college-campuses,"AUGUST 22, 2010","It’s that time of year again, school is in session, and it’s the perfect time to get involved with veg events on campus. Whether you’re a bright-eyed freshman or a skeptical student-for-life, being in college offers many opportunities to promote veganism and meet other like-minded people. Look for information on your school’s website to find out how to start a campus group. Most schools have resources to help set up clubs and organizations, and might provide you with meeting spaces, guidance, and even funds. When planning food events such as bake sales and potlucks, be sure to contact your local student government for information about venues. Some schools have policies regarding selling and serving food, so play by the rules! Fundraising
You’ve gathered a bunch of compassionate people together—now how to go about raising funds for the animal charity of your choice? A great place to start is with a bake sale. Enticing your classmates with delectable vegan goods is an approachable and effective way to get others excited about your cause. How about some Vanilla Cupcakes, Death By Chocolate Brownies, or Classic Snickerdoodles to start you off? Another way to raise funds while getting your eat on is to approach veg-friendly restaurants in your community and ask if they are willing to donate a percentage of their proceeds for one night, and then plan a group dine-out to support both the restaurant and the cause. If the event is a success, the restaurant might be willing to work with your group on a regular basis. Education inside and outside of the classroom
Many courses offer opportunities for you to bring your interest and knowledge about veganism and animals rights to research projects, presentations, and papers. Whether educating your nutrition professor on the health benefits of a vegan diet, or teaching classmates about animal-protection laws, the classroom is a place where fellow students will be open to hearing an informed opinion on veg issues. Vegan food for everyone
Arrange potlucks to expose guests to veg food or to double as planning meetings, and work to veganize your dining halls! Most campuses are catered by big organizations such as Compass Group, who recently upped its veg options. Urge your campus bookstore to stock vegan cookbooks and books about animal rights. Consider arranging cooking workshops to help show others how easy and delicious veg meals can be. Publicize
It’s vital to the success of your organization and events to have a strong team of media-savvy volunteers to handle publicity. Luckily, an arsenal of social networking tools such as Twitter and Facebook can help get the word out, and don’t be afraid to jump on any positive press opportunity that presents itself. The great thing about college groups is that every member has his or her own strengths—art students can design posters and logos, computer techs can construct a website, future politicians can speak at events. Everyone will have the opportunity to use their skills to educate and to promote a cause. Isn’t that what college is all about? "

VEGAN SCHOOL LUNCHES YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/vegan-school-lunches-your-kids-will-love,"AUGUST 17, 2010","Chances are, children are moaning and groaning about the end of summer and the dreaded trek back to school. Give them a little incentive to get into the learning groove with tasty vegan lunches that are both wholesome and delicious. Balancing Act
With a little planning and some creativity, you can easily prepare fun lunches that you might even have a hard time parting with. While health-savvy parents want little ones to eat only the most nutritious foods, if you pack a bag of dulse, celery sticks, and Kombucha, chances are they’ll be a little reluctant to show off the contents of their BPA-free lunch boxes. A good rule of thumb for lunches is including mostly vegetables, one or more pieces of fruit, some protein, healthy fats, and energizing carbohydrates. This formula can manifest in a dreary collection of plain ingredients, or it can be a tempting whole-grain tortilla stuffed with Almost-Cuban Black Beans, avocado, plantains, tomatoes, and a zippy Mango Salsa. Fruit becomes a decadent dessert when dipped in a Creamy Cashew Dip or in the form of Goji Fruit Leathers. Transform vegetables into Kale Chips, Potato Salad, or Caesar Salad With Blackened Tempeh. Get in some protein with Tofu Fingers, warming Chickpea and Lentil Soup, or Dreena Burton’s yummy Spicoli Burgers stuffed in a fluffy whole-wheat pita. Let them eat cupcakes
Whether at the mall, a friend’s house, the movies or the corner store, children are exposed to plenty of junk food. Prohibiting kids from eating anything sweet or salty could make them crave it more, so tame your own nutritional militancy and let them indulge in the occasional vegan treat. Even if you’re the proud parent of a rare, chard-munching mini-hippie, chances are children are going to want something sugary when it comes to snacks. Easy Pleasin’ Oat Bars, Jelly Doughnut Cupcakes, and Berry Hand Pies are sure to be hits. Store-bought snacks such as Pirate Brands Veggie Booty and Annie’s Fruit Bunnies are healthier alternatives and great in a snack-attack pinch. Allergen Alert
As more schools ban the old PB&J standby, it’s best to keep the peanut butter for after-school snacks. Never fear, children can still indulge on a version of the classic sandwich, thanks to products such as pea butter and soy butter standing in for peanut butter.

MUSICAL DUO PROMOTE VEGANISM,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/musical-duo-promote-veganism,"AUGUST 17, 2010","Rodrigo Sánchez and Gabriela Quintero, who make up the Mexican acoustic guitar group Rodrigo y Gabriela, have joined forces with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in a new campaign promoting a vegan lifestyle. In the campaign video, Quintero reveals that she recently went vegan after PETA exposed her to the cruelties associated with egg farming and leather, and Sánchez cites veganism as “one solution for many, many problems.” The duo explain that they see human and animal rights linked, and encourage people to consider adopting a veg diet. Sánchez suggests that if you start by cutting out meat and animal products one or two times a week, then you start to become more compassionate, thinking more about not just animals, but also about world hunger.

"NEW RAW, VEGAN CAFÉ IN DETROIT",https://vegnews.com/2010/8/new-raw-vegan-cafe-in-detroit,"AUGUST 17, 2010","A new vegan, raw, organic café and juice bar, called The Raw Café, is set to open in Detroit at the end of August. Founder LaKeta McCauley; who is also a certified raw chef, author, and certified nutrionist, among other things; first started a gourmet raw food meal delivery service in 2007 out of a desire to bring the message of food healing to other people. As a breast cancer survivor, McCauley believes that eating raw, organic, and vegan food goes a long way toward optimum health. The restaurant, she says, will have an eclectic feel and feature savory meals as well as treats such as waffle cones and ice cream. McCauley has also written a book on raw healing, titled Taking Every “Bite” Seriously. "
POULTRY AND FOOD POISONING,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/poultry-and-food-poisoning,"AUGUST 17, 2010","The Centers for Disease Control released a new study of food-borne illnesses Thursday, August 12, in which it finds poultry and beef to be the leading transporters of food poisoning. In the study, the CDC found that chicken, turkey, and other poultry are responsible for 17 percent of food-borne illnesses, beef 16 percent, and leafy vegetables 14 percent. The report was based on information from 2007. In 2006, poultry was also the leading cause of food-borne illnesses. An estimated 87 million cases of food poisoning occur in the US each year. "
THE GROWING WORLD OF VEG FESTIVALS,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/the-growing-world-of-veg-festivals,"AUGUST 17, 2010","From the time the ground begins to thaw until when the last leaves fall, veg societies and animal-rights organizations are hosting festivals and conferences at venues across the country. One of the primary goals of many veg and animal-rights (AR) organizations is outreach, and the events serve as a way to extend the message of compassion to the masses. More than informing the public, these gatherings are opportunities to construct and strengthen the veg and AR communities, while revealing to the world the passion, popularity, and potential of each movement. Sharon Graff, of the North American Vegetarian Society (NAVS), has seen an increase in vegan attendees at the annual Vegetarian Summerfest, and says, “There could be many reasons for this, such as a greater desire to create a sense of community, a realization that the problems caused by meat production require action, or it may reflect a growth in the number of vegans in recent years.” Some of the pioneers recall the 1975 World Vegetarian Congress, hosted by the then-newly formed NAVS, as the impetus that began the current movement. Alex Hershaft, founder and president of Farm Animal Rights Movement, remembers the World Vegetarian Congress as a time when people from all over the world; regardless of dress, economic stations, age, or demographic; came together, with vegetarianism being the one thing bonding them. From that first meeting, local vegetarian societies were formed throughout the country. In 1981, Hershaft launched the first Action for Life conference, an event he remembers as, “a launching pad for the animal-rights movement,” and where People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals became a national organization. It wasn’t until 10 years later that Hershaft would begin hosting a conference again, creating the AR National Conference in 1997. Since the 1975 conference, diverse groups have formed around the issues of veg lifestyles and animal rights. Dozens of festivals and conferences now take place across the country, all with different approaches and goals. President of the Boston Vegetarian Society, Evelyn Kimber, says when they planned the first Boston Vegetarian Food Festival 15 years ago, they did so with an “enthusiastic group of volunteers” and without the help of the internet. But the Boston Vegetarian Food Festival has grown since then, and like many festivals, Kimber says it has helped share the ideals of vegetarianism with mainstream audiences and made the lifestyle more accessible. The VeggieFest Chicago, hosted by the Science of Spirituality, tries to achieve accessibility through a friendly approach, striving to positively “emphasize the benefits for health, spirituality, ecology, and world hunger,” Michael Ribet, one of the founder’s says. Through strategies such as these, Erica Meier, executive director of Compassion Over Killing, which along with the Vegetarian Society of DC revived the DC Veg Fest in 2009, says the public is learning and becoming aware of the issues associated with a meat-based lifestyle, but there is a growing number of people that still don’t know how to change. The DC Veg Fest, along with other festivals and conferences, provides resources and information on leading a healthy, cruelty-free life. Taking outreach a step further, many festivals aim to inspire and empower attendees to take action once they leave the conference. Graff, of the NAVS Summerfest, says that in addition to providing a fun, educational atmosphere, the festival also hopes to equip those interested with the fundamentals for local activism. Michael Markarian, chief operating officer of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), says that the HSUS-sponsored Taking Action For Animals (TAFA) conference specifically seeks to help individuals become animal advocates through training in “outreach, lobbying, media interactions, working with corporations, and other hands-on skills.” Similarly, since its inception, the AR National Conference has had the same goal: “To share experience, to strategize, and to recharge batteries,” Hershaft says. Festivals and conferences have seen steady growth in participation and popularity. When the VeggieFest Chicago began five years ago, it had less than 2,000 people attend. This past August, more than 22,000 people attended. The San Francisco World Vegetarian Festival has grown so much that in the past five years, it has moved to a larger venue and added additional days. The AR National Conference began alternating conference locations between Los Angeles and Washington, DC, to broaden the reach of its message and make the conference available to more people. And for the first time this past July, TAFA had a Student Summit track, “so we are cultivating not just today’s advocates, but tomorrow’s,” Markarian says. The conferences and festivals continue to grow, extending days and expanding their reach. No matter the location or the method, festivals and conferences have blossomed to become an important staple in the veg and AR movements, bringing people together to strengthen a common goal. As Markarian says, “Our movement is fueled by human energy.” "

VEGAN BIOGAS,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/vegan-biogas,"AUGUST 16, 2010","British company Ecotricity has pledged that all of its new biogas will be vegan. The company, which was originally known for supplying British homes with wind energy, announced in June that it would now be offering biogas for households that use gas. Essentially, biogas is energy made from biodegradable, landfill-bound sources, which environmentalists have voiced concern over regarding the potential for deforestation and the use of livestock waste to produce the commodity. However, CEO Dale Vince, who himself is vegan, has promised that no animal products will be used in the making of biogas. Ecotricity is the first company in the UK to supply sustainable gas. "

Bethel started collecting donations in the form of pocket change after feeling overwhelmed by the enormity of the oil spill and its effect on the animals and the environment. The original goal was $500, but Bethel has seen donations come in from all over, including from one man who handed over his entire unopened piggy bank. “He just never had the heart to break it open. When we did it for him, it had over $300 in it for the animals,” said Bethel. "
URBAN GARDENERS GROWING NEAR YOU,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/urban-gardeners-growing-near-you,"AUGUST 16, 2010","Urban gardeners know that you don’t need sprawling green acres of land to harvest heirloom tomatoes, Italian onions, and dinosaur kale—all you really need is a fire escape. Whether sowing seeds in a neighborhood community garden or growing organic herbs on a living room windowsill, the local-foods movement brings herbivores even closer to the food on their plates. Southern California-native Adriana Martinez created her organic, vegan gardening blog Anarchy in the Garden to do just that. As the garden manager for the Wrigley Village Community Garden in Long Beach, Calif., Martinez advocates sharing and swapping produce with neighbors to increase awareness and build community. “I think we need to rely on each other a little bit more,” she says. “If we bring it down to a more local level, we can really make some positive changes.” Martinez believes that urban gardening shares some of the same revolutionary, DIY principles as punk rock, and sustains her family with crops harvested from every last spare piece of earth she can find—including a narrow patch of grass near where she parks her car. Martinez waters her citrus trees with collected shower water, uses homemade compost as fertilizer, and suggests routine crop rotation to minimize pests and soil-borne diseases. Her blog is full of gardening success stories, such as preparing daily meals—Raw Vegan Angel Hair “Pasta” with Pesto, for starters—entirely from homegrown greens. Just as important to Martinez, the blog also details her failures. By writing about what did and did not work for her, she is able to create a public dialogue that engages readers and makes farming accessible to those living in concrete jungles. Urban growers have turned to Martinez as a vegan gardening resource, using her wisdom to cultivate green gardens of their own. Just as Martinez has inspired the metropolitan masses to get their hands dirty with her backyard farm in California, urban, vegan gardener Mike Lieberman has debunked the myth that planting requires acres of land by harvesting crops on his Manhattan fire escape. Born and raised in New York City with no knowledge of agriculture, Lieberman is a successful, self-taught gardener. More than a year ago, Lieberman began documenting his foray into farming on his blog Urban Organic Gardener, which has since become a destination site for people curious about urban crop growing. Despite season changes and weather challenges, Lieberman enjoyed an impressive growing season on his fire escape in 2009, with greens sprouting from May until December. In April, Lieberman moved from Manhattan to Los Angeles, and he plans to grow year-round from his new California balcony. Like Martinez, Lieberman hopes to motivate others to grow their own food through his blog, offering everything from how-to guides on building self-watering containers, to his opinions about which plants produce the most generously. “It would make a big difference if everyone just grew one thing. You don’t have to invest much money: Just take a soda bottle, cut the top off, get some organic soil, buy an herb plant or lettuce, and start growing,” says Liberman. Growing an urban garden might seem intimidating, but the trick is in knowing where to begin. Consult these handy resources to go from seedling student to master planter. Anarchy in the Garden

The goal of the Neuter-a-Thon is to reach out to low-income families with animal companions in five cities throughout the state. The Neuter-a-Thon was first started in 1999, and now 24 students and volunteers participate in preventing the birth of unwanted animals. In addition to neutering, the vets at Neuter-a-Thon also provide vaccines for the companion animals. Michigan, which as of June 2010 had the second highest unemployment rate in the country, euthanizes more than 100,000 animals due to overcrowding at shelters. "
VEGAN PET FOOD YOUR DOGS AND CATS WILL GOBBLE UP,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/vegan-pet-food-your-dogs-and-cats-will-gobble-up,"AUGUST 15, 2010","If you’ve ever been a guardian for an animal, you know the look. It’s the big-eyed look that is their way of telling you, “I’m hungry.” As a guardian, it’s your responsibility to make sure those little furry tummies never growl for too long. As a vegan, you also know it’s your decision to not participate in an industry in conflict with your values. Where do you find the medium between living ethically and keeping your companion animal healthy? Commercial Companion Food
It shouldn’t come as a shock that enticing pet food advertisements are more or less lies: Pet food contains anything but the pure grains and meat that commercials picture. Fifty percent of commercial brands can be comprised of what is referred to as “meat meal” and animal byproducts, which include body parts unfit for human consumption such as brains, spinal cords, and heads. Four-D meat from dead, dying, diseased, or disabled animals also makes its way into commercial pet food, as well as restaurant grease, slaughterhouse waste, and a long list of other toxins, pesticides, and hormones—all of which contribute to the mass recalls the industry often sees. Veterinarians, such as LA-based vegan house-call vet Dr. Armaiti May, believes that the composition of most commercial pet food can increase the likelihood of cancer, kidney failure, and other degenerative diseases in animals. Therefore, many pet guardians are turning to vegan options for their companion animals. Vegan Dogs
Many benefits have been reported for dogs eating a vegetarian diet, including healthier skin and coat, better dental health, weight management, reduction of allergic reactions, better digestion, increased energy, and a decreased risk of cancer. May says that though dogs are biologically omnivorous, they are able to adapt to a plant-based diet, as long as the guardian ensures all nutrient requirements are met. When transitioning dogs to a plant-based diet, the process should be gradual, first mixing the vegan and non-vegan foods to allow the dog’s digestive system to acclimate. May also recommends that guardians bring dogs to the vet two to three weeks after beginning the new diet to evaluate how the dog’s body is reacting. Additional information for your dog’s health can be found through the Vegan Dog Nutrition Association. Vegan Cats
Cats, naturally carnivorous, are slightly more difficult to transition to a vegan diet than dogs. They tend to have more dietary restrictions and needs than dogs, and it can become challenging to ensure that all their health needs are met. Still, with the proper care to meet nutritional requirements, a cat can successfully become vegan. The catch for cats is that they require the amino acid taurine, which is naturally found in meat. If a cat’s taurine needs are not met, it can suffer from blindness or heart disease. Luckily, taurine is now available in synthetic form. As is the case with dogs, cats should see a veterinarian shortly after the diet transition is made. Serving Dinner
Whether you’re ready to roll up your sleeves and make your own companion food, or you’d rather buy safer—and more ethical—food, there are plenty of options. Vegan blogger Whitney Lauritsen feeds her dog Evie V-Dog, a nutritionally balanced dog food made primarily of grains and vegetables. For the cats, Vegan Cats offers a wide variety of options for even the pickiest of eaters.
But if you prefer to have even more control over what goes into your companion animal’s body, making your own food, or adding natural ingredients to a store-bought vegan companion food, are viable options. For guidance and recipes, May suggests the book Vegetarian Dogs: Toward a World Without Exploitation. When Lauritsen’s companion Evie was a puppy, she would make homemade food with recipes from Vegedog. Additionally, adding fresh produce to vegan companion food can help the digestive tract, with options including asparagus, peas, brown rice, garbanzos, corn, and Brussels sprouts. Mock meats can be used to help your cat adjust to a vegan diet. And once your companion has made the transition to veganism, be sure to award them with a treat! With a fresh, healthy vegan diet, your companion will be giving you puppy-dog eyes over an empty bowl for years to come. "

CALIFORNIA FUR-LABELING BILL,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/california-fur-labeling-bill,"AUGUST 14, 2010","The California State Senate passed a Humane Society of the United States-sponsored bill on August 11 that would require labeling on all fur garments indicating what kind of animal fur was used in its production. The bill still awaits the approval of Governor Schwarzenegger. The bill is intended to help consumers make ethical choices about the fur products they buy, as more and more consumers are finding objection to the use of animal fur for garments. If a garment is not marked, people might be under the assumption that the fur is fake, and unknowingly support an industry they oppose. "

Girls who consumed the highest amount of animal products at age 7 were 75 percent more likely to begin menstruating by age 12 than those who consumed the least amount of meat. In addition to the higher cancer risk among those who experience early puberty, younger children might not be mature enough to deal with the emotionally taxing experience of puberty. Joel Fuhrman, M.D., urges parents to help slow down their children’s development by feeding them a plant-based diet. "

VEGAN ROAD TRIP!,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/vegan-road-trip,"AUGUST 11, 2010","Before the back-to-school bell rings and the sun sets on summer, why not fit in one last memorable trip? From coast to coast, VN has pulled together our favorite veg-friendly cities, each guaranteeing the best events, eats, and cultural treats for the adventurous veg vacationer. And don’t forget—Portland gets its very own entry! New York
Start spreading the news—New York reigns supreme. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was founded in New York City in 1866, and is the first humane organization to be established in North America—and one of the largest in the world. The Fund for Animals has also called the city home since 1967. The UN headquarters sits just above the East River, and recently its Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, urged a reduction in meat consumption to curb global warming. And on a more social note, New York is also home of the original Vegan Drinks event, giving birth to a nationwide phenomenon.  From Vegan’s Delight in the Bronx down to Strictly Vegetarian in Brooklyn, New York is a city for foodies. Dine on seitan piccata at Candle 79 on the Upper East Side or simply grab a tofu turnover from the Body and Soul cart at Brooklyn’s Grand Army Plaza Greenmarket. MooShoes will shod your deserving feet in leather-free footwear, and if that isn’t enough, vegans can undergo a sugar-induced religious experience at Lula’s Sweet Apothecary.

Chef Rich Landau co-founded Horizons, Philadelphia’s epicurean pinnacle of vegan cookery, bringing delicious cuisine to the heart of his lifelong home. “Since we opened up downtown,” he says, “other restaurants have caught on. They see we are packed all the time and [now] you can get a decent veg offering in a lot of mainstream restaurants.” With restaurants such as Horizons at the high end, many others are filling bellies in a more casual way. Among the most popular are Govinda’s Gourmet Vegetarian, Kingdom of Vegetarians, and Singapore. The Humane League works on the advocacy front bringing veganism and compassionate living to the greater Philadelphia area. Since 2005, the group has done outreach, campaigned for policy changes, and rescued and placed hundreds of displaced, endangered animals. It also produced a series of vegan cooking shows with local vegan chef and writer Rachel Klein.
Favorite local find: The vegan pizza offered up at Gianna’s Grille should be a national treasure. Seattle
For those who subscribe to the belief that under a wet, grey sky, nothing goes better with a good cup of java than an equally great doughnut, check out Mighty-O Donuts. Since opening in 2000, Mighty-O has created artisan, organic, vegan doughnuts. For the epicurean palate, look no further than Capitol Hill, where Plum Bistro recently opened its doors. The savory and spicy Cajun Mac ‘n’ Yease has received glowing reviews. Today, Seattle offers a growing number of veg-friendly businesses, from vegan tattoos at Damask Tattoo to the completely vegan store Sidecar for Pigs Peace. Pizza Pi offers up cruelty-free slices of heaven six days a week, and one would be hard pressed to find a tastier, more satisfying brunch than the one served at Café Flora. Of course, no survey of Seattle’s vegan restaurants would be complete without mentioning Wayward Café and its incredibly delectable biscuits and gravy.
Favorite local find: Hillside Quickie Vegan Sandwich Shop is just as satisfying as the name would have you believe. Washington, DC
In so many ways, our nation’s capital leads by example, and increasingly so for the animals. Five-year resident and self-described “lawyer, writer, and citizen lobbyist” Amber McDonald went vegan after moving to DC. She recently drafted a resolution sponsored by Councilwoman Yvette Alexander to bring Meat-Free Mondays to DC. Since 2001, Sticky Fingers Bakery has sweetened the city with delicious vegan desserts. From there, it’s a quick cruise downhill to Dupont Circle where, this spring, Café Green opened. Perhaps the bistro will become a great place to take a new date whom you met at DC Vegan Drinks, held monthly at veg-friendly Bread & Brew. McDonald might be able to help you out there, too. She says, “I’ve received permission from SuperVegan to launch their ‘Date This Vegan’ feature at [local blog] DC Vegan. I’m really looking forward to bringing together people for some veggie love in the District.”
Favorite local find: Sticky Fingers’ General Manager Ben Adams loves the vegan tapas at Jaleo so much that his rehearsal dinner was held there. Chicago
Chicago has exploded onto the vegan scene with nationally renowned businesses such as Vaute Couture, Upton’s Naturals seitan, and Chicago Soydairy. The latter, founded by Ryan Howard and Daniel Ziegler, quickly rose to prominence with its triple-threat offerings of vegan ice cream, marshmallows, and cheese. Since 1983, The Chicago Diner has served mouthwatering vegetarian cuisine on the North Side. Leanne Mai-ly Hilgart, founder of Vaute Couture, recalls the “most delicious summer of [her] life” working there. She also sings the praises of Karyn’s on Green as the new vegan “it” spot: “I dreamt of a dressy, gorgeous vegan restaurant in Chicago—and there it was!” Sweet Cakes Bakery supplies Chicagoans with vegan root beer cupcakes, and iCream’s customizable menu keeps the vegan ice cream coming. With popular meet-ups such as Vegan Chicago, events such as Chicago VeganMania, and animal-free eateries, Midwestern vegans are crooning the words that Sinatra once sang—Chicago is my kind of town.

Deep in the heart of Texas sits a thriving oasis known as Austin. Daniela Nunez has lived there her whole life. A self-described socially networked vegan and animal-rights activist, she has witnessed the increasing number of veg options and the blossoming activism in her hometown. “Austin deserves to be called veg-friendly,” she says. “About five years ago, there were fewer vegan-friendly restaurants you could depend on,” Nunez reports. “Now we’re seeing more choices of where to eat and where to connect with other vegans. We have a couple of all-vegan restaurants and food trucks, and it seems like I hear about new vegan options every day.” Like many cities, Austin hosts a rapidly expanding and popular Vegan Drinks meetup. The event’s outreach efforts connected with several hundred people in conjunction with South by Southwest—Austin’s premier music and film festival that is quickly becoming the most prominent of its kind in the country.
Favorite local find: Counter Culture is an all-vegan and raw-foods trailer run by chef Sue Davis, who has veganized American favorites from Philly cheesesteaks to tuna salad sandwiches. San Francisco
San Francisco might only boast 49 square miles of space, but it packs plenty into its dense, distinct neighborhoods. In the Mission District alone, a vegan can walk mere blocks for vegan beers, brats, and bike culture at Gestalt Haus; tofu scrambles and shawarma wraps at casual staple Herbivore; the world’s greatest vegan burritos at Papalote; and to-die-for vegan sundaes at nearby Bernal Height’s MaggieMudd. And that’s just one small (albeit popular) district in the City by the Bay. In April, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution encouraging restaurants, stores, and schools to celebrate Vegetarian Day by offering vegetarian options on that day to improve general civic health. Superstar restaurant Millennium has served upscale veg cuisine for 15 years, and San Francisco’s bi-monthly vegan bake sale brings in thousands of dollars (more than $18,000 to date) for animal-rescue charities. And of course, it’s the city that VN calls its home.
Favorite local find: Rodger’s Coffee & Tea, which also happens to be in the Mission, doles out fresh, vegan beignets and the best coffee in town. Atlanta
Hot ‘Lanta has long been the energetic cultural center of the South. It’s the largest city in the region, home to internationally recognized brands Coca-Cola and CNN, and like the other great urban centers on this list, has become increasingly veg-friendly. Local favorite Veggieland has been serving global cuisine since the 1990s. The vegan mock meats and Chinese standards at Harmony Vegetarian have filled bellies for almost as long; and although you can find Soul Vegetarian restaurants across the country, none feel quite as down-home as its two locations in metro Atlanta. Leigh and Ken Saluzzi run Cosmo’s Vegan Shoppe in nearby Marietta, Ga., the only 100-percent vegan online store and storefront in the Southeast. They point out a host of veg community outlets: “Second Opinion Radio is a local radio show that is animal-rights-themed; Georgia Animal Rights and Protection do a good bit of the local protests and demonstrations.” Atlanta also has two all-vegan bakeries opening soon. Dough Bakery will set up shop in Inman Park, while across town Dulce Vegan plans to open in Grant Park.

In the last year, Los Angeles has become the undisputed king of vegan pizza, thanks in no small part to the popularity of Daiya. Yes, melted cheesy vegan pies get delivered right to local doorsteps by Santa Monica’s Pizza Fusion. Los Feliz’s Cruzer Pizza & Pasta went all-vegan and named one of its most popular works after Quarrygirl, an LA-based food blogger. Purgatory Pizza has been slinging soy cheese since it opened. Angeleno pizza doesn’t mean squat to the rest of the world, but for vegans, this town has arrived. The gourmet taco truck phenomenon has also entered the haute cuisine category. Food carts such as The Dosa Truck offer several vegan eats, as does the Mandoline Grill. Both can be tracked via Twitter, and for a real treat, don’t miss the all-vegan dogs at The FrankenStand. For a sit-down meal in between working out and star-spotting, The Veggie Grill is a must-visit. Burgers galore and addictive sweet potato fries to boot—what could be better?

With its concentration of colleges and a tradition of liberal thought, it seems surprising that it has taken so long for the vegetarian and vegan impact to reach Boston. Sure, it’s always been there, lurking in compassionate shadows—the Boston Vegetarian Society was founded in 1986, and Wheeler’s Black Label Vegan Ice Cream began in 1987—but this year, meat-free New Englanders can really claim the city as their own. Eric Prescott, who moved to Boston two-and-a-half years ago, notes the increase and diversification of veg restaurants, including Peace O’ Pie Gourmet Vegan Pizza, a plant-based pizzeria he co-founded last fall. Prescott is also the co-founder and director of the Boston Vegan Association, which offers “vegan community, activist education, and [an] outlet for animal-rights advocacy work.” Don’t forget the annual Boston Vegetarian Food Festival, now in its 15th year. The longest running, all-veg food festival in the country attracts thousands of visitors each year and spans two days.

FILM FEATURES VEGAN CHARACTER,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/film-features-vegan-character,"AUGUST 10, 2010","To be released August 13, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World might poke fun at stereotypes, but that doesn’t mean that Todd Ingram, the rock star vegan whom Scott (played by Michael Cera) must defeat, portrays veganism in a negative light. The film is based on a series of graphic novels (one of which includes a recipe for vegan Shepherd’s Pie), and ‘veganity,’ as it is called in the film, is featured. “Todd isn’t necessarily the nicest promoter of the vegan lifestyle, but it speaks well of it to say that you get the power of telekinesis and superpowers because you’re more clear, you’re more healthy, all of those things,” said actor Brandon Routh, who plays Ingram.

Goldwyn’s findings led him to the decision to go meatless for 30 days. The key points that swayed his decision were the inhumane conditions at factory farms and the fact that meat-production methods might be harmful to humans. He hopes to see how the vegetarian diet makes him feel and challenge his meatless cooking skills. “I may discover I need less meat than I thought,” he writes. Goldwyn will blog about the diet and post recipes on his normally meat-centric website. "

They exhibit higher literacy, increased understanding of food production, wider vocabularies, better awareness of the seasons, a sense of responsibility, more self-confidence, and a plethora of additional benefits. What’s more, many of the students were so enthused about the gardens, they wanted to start gardens at home. "

The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) held a roundtable discussion regarding BP’s announcement, and experts from the Land, Water, and Wildlife and International Climate Programs, and the EDF, stated their concerns. Steve Hamburg, of the EDF, said, “Most of these smaller molecules are still somewhere in the Gulf’s waters, and as they decompose, they will consume oxygen, which will threaten the Gulf ecosystem.” The latest numbers from the International Bird Rescue Research Center reports that 5,771 birds affected by the oil spill that have been collected, more than 3,900 of which have died, and of the 1,020 sea turtles affected and collected, 517 have died.

From California to Chicago to New York, it’s becoming more accessible to pick up a vegan pie, no questions asked. Still, some customers can’t quite claim veg options in their city (check out our tips for improving veg options), and others are trying to cut back on dining out. Luckily, there’s one place you can always get the ultimate pizza: your kitchen. Variety is the Spice
With thousands of pizzerias to choose from, there are two things that separate one pie from the next: the crust and the sauce. At least 21 regional pizza styles are recognized, from the classic New York-style to the lesser-known Ohio-valley style. Shape, crust style, and sauce are the secrets to pizzerias’ attempts to distinguish themselves from the competition. Whether you’ve sampled every style or stick to what you know, recreating your favorite pie at home is a snap. If you want to start simple, whip up an easy crust and add this versatile pizza sauce for a mouth-watering base. Prefer deep-dish pan pizza? Try this herbed deep-dish crust, and perform your own masterful tweaks such as seasoning add-ins, special sizes, and endless topping combinations. Essential Utensils
Investing in a $5,000 brick oven may not be the first step to take when approaching at-home pizza making. On the other hand, there are a few tricks of the trade that will raise the chances of a restaurant-quality creation instead of a DIY disaster. Barna Mink, San Francisco-based activist and founder of the blog Ethical Pizza, recommends three key items for serious chefs, all costing less than $15. Tricks of the Trade
Once your kitchen is stocked with all the must-have gadgets, keep these tips in mind before you begin.

VN CHATS WITH MAROON 5’S VEGAN BASSIST MICKEY MADDEN,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/vn-chats-with-maroon-5s-vegan-bassist-mickey-madden,"AUGUST 8, 2010","Since breaking onto the Billboard charts in 2003 with their top 10 hit “Harder to Breathe,” Maroon 5 has been a rock-and-roll force to be reckoned with. Bassist Mickey Madden has been with the band since the beginning, when he founded an early incarnation of the group with friends Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael in high school. Today, Maroon 5 is as popular as ever, with fans across the world clamoring for the September 21 release of the band’s latest album, Hands All Over. While the past 10 years have seen Maroon 5’s rise to international fame and success, they have also marked Madden’s first decade of veganism. The plant-based bassist recently talked with VN about the group’s latest album, how to find vegan food on the road, and why he doesn’t eat animals. VegNews: What’s your favorite part of being vegan?
Mickey Madden: I’m a really big lover of animals, and, at the risk of sounding like a total hippie, I do feel more connected to the world at large and to animals. VN: What sparked your transition to veganism?
MM: It’s been almost 10 years since I went vegan, so at this point it’s such a part of my life that it’s hard to remember living otherwise. I sort of gave up animal products incrementally. I gave up eating [some] animals when I was in high school, and then slowly whittled away the rest of the meat that I was eating, and then dairy. I think the conscious choice to actually become vegan came about 10 years ago with a little bit of education on my part and sort of the main texts of the movement, [the works of] Peter Singer and Eric Schlosser. VN: How does the rest of the band respond to your veganism?
MM: We’re all extremely health-conscious and everyone is really vegan-friendly. Adam [Levine], the singer in the band, in particular will eat, I’d say, about 85-percent vegan for health reasons. All the band members are meat-eaters, but they’re not close-minded and [they] understand the principles of veganism. It makes a big difference. It’s so strange, I obviously have reasons that relate to the world at large for my veganism, but it’s so much a personal choice and a matter of personal preference that I’ve never understood the reaction to it that some people have. VN: What are your go-to foods when touring?
MM: Initially when we were on tour, it was a much more difficult landscape. Los Angeles, where we’re from, is a very veg-friendly city and always has been, so it’s an easy place to make that transition [to veganism]. I’m a lover of food too, so whatever sort of restrictions I put on myself I still was able to enjoy the gamut of food. That made it a little bit easier, but being on tour was difficult at first because a lot of the food we could afford was unhealthy, a lot of junk food. As time went on, we found certain places that were really vegan-friendly. It was a lot of ethnic food, such as Asian and Indian food. College towns also always seem to have something veggie-friendly. VN: Maroon 5 is about to tour in support of your latest album, Hands All Over. Are you excited to hit the road?
MM: We just left for our next tour and the new album is coming out on September 21. It feels really good to be back on tour because we haven’t been out for a while. We finished touring for our second record at the end of 2008, and since then we’ve mostly been home writing. Then we went to Europe to record the album. We’re very excited to present new songs and we’ve reworked a lot of our old material and it’s just nice. We enjoy touring. When you’re home and in writing-and-recording mode you sort of forget what the point of it is, which is to reach and communicate with people through the songs. VN: How easy was it to eat vegan while recording in Switzerland?
MM: I was extremely fortunate in working with a producer who had been a raw vegan for a long time. So he was very dialed-in [to local restaurants] and ordered off-menu, so I followed his lead. Being able to shop for groceries makes a big difference, which initially made being on tour harder. Living in Switzerland for a couple of months I managed pretty well, shopping and cooking for myself. "

8 VEGAN HAIR CARE COMPANIES FOR YOUR TRESSES,https://vegnews.com/2010/8/8-vegan-hair-care-companies-for-your-tresses,"AUGUST 1, 2010","Whether you don flowing hippie tresses, bounce around with a bob, or let your locks fall somewhere in between, healthy, shiny, and gorgeous hair is what we all want. When you’re vegan, many of the products on the market promising perfect hairdos turn out to be absolute don’ts. Like so much man-made merchandise, hair products can be loaded with animal products hiding behind the guise of long, unpronounceable names. Luckily, we’ve put together a list of chemicals to avoid and a few hair care suggestions to ensure that everyday is a good hair day. Shampoo
The next time you’re lathering up, check the back of the bottle for Hydrolyzed Animal Protein, which is mostly derived from cows, pigs, and chickens. In shampoo, it’s used to add gloss or reduce split ends. Luckily, vegan shampoo products are easy to find. For dry hair, Aubrey Organics promises to replenish with reparative oils. Giovanni’s Four Elements gives the salon experience at home without the harmful additives. Kiss My Face Miss Treated Shampoo helps to undo everything chemicals have done to your hair. Conditioner
Conditioner provides your hair with the strength conditioning to be healthy and voluminous—but can also be full of animal derivatives. Stearic Acid, sometimes derived from cows, sheep, dogs, and cats can be found in conditioner. The same goes for steroids, often derived from animal glands and also used in hair conditioners. Some ethical alternatives include Desert Essence coconut conditioner, which in addition to being vegan is fragrance- and gluten-free. For fuller, more voluminous hair, Jason’s Biotin Conditioner promises to thicken strands and add moisture. Finishing touches
The finishing touches give your locks a little oomph. But from hairspray to smoothing creams, finishing products are often not vegan. Keratin is found in permanent wave solutions, and is made from animal horns and hooves. Cysteine, an amino acid, can also come from animals, and is sometimes used in creams. For some animal-friendly alternatives, try Aveda volumizing tonic with certified organic aloe that is sure to add height to your hair. And Beauty Without Cruelty hairspray has been cruelty-free since 1963, and will give your hair extra hold. Resources
Walk through any hair care aisle and you’ll see that there are more hair products out there than you’d care to count. Ingredients are the first place to start in your search for the perfect ‘do.

HOW TO HELP THOSE DEVASTATED BY THE BP OIL SPILL,https://vegnews.com/2010/7/how-to-help-those-devastated-by-the-bp-oil-spill,"JULY 19, 2010","On July 15, BP announced that its Deepwater Horizon drilling rig off the Gulf of Mexico had been capped, marking the first significant, successful step to ending one of the largest oil spills ever recorded. The US government estimates that more than 180 million gallons of oil has seeped into the Gulf since the rig exploded on April 20, and the environmental effects of the 85-day disaster remain largely unknown. Fallout from the oil spill has ranged from horror over the haphazard, inept solutions posed by BP to bigger conversations about dependence on oil. Much like the terrifying aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, without precedent to guide relief efforts, effective solutions were slow-coming. With the leak capped, environmental groups are rallying to organize clean-up efforts, and politicians continue to file negligence complaints against BP, yet relief for the spill is far from finished. Animal activists across the country are echoing a compassionate reminder to all those who think the worst is over: The time for swift, decisive action for animals is now. In addition to birds, fish, sea turtles, and local marine and coastal wildlife, a mass of companion animals have been abandoned by displaced Louisiana families, and even with animal-protection groups and thousands of volunteers working tirelessly to cut through red tape and save animals, more help is needed. Kelly Overton, founder and executive director of People Protecting Animas & Their Habitats (PATH), arrived in the Gulf almost immediately after news of the spill broke. Formerly a New York-based organization, the group relocated its headquarters to New Orleans in May. Overton should have been the ideal candidate for BP’s clean-up team to recruit, but that wasn’t the case. “Who is a good volunteer for BP? Is it someone who knows how to do this, or is it someone who is right down the middle and isn’t going to ask any questions?” says Overton. However, for the time being, the PATH crusader isn’t wasting energy on debating the politics of Big Oil, but rather focusing on how to most effectively aid animals. The group estimates that close to 55,000 animals have already died, but thanks to steadfast and compassionate volunteers, many others have been rescued. Currently, PATH is collecting and distributing simple but life-saving supplies such as heating pads, plastic feeding syringes, water picks, extension cords, and plastic bins, as well as food for a South Louisiana food bank feeding displaced locals. For PATH, the connection between helping save animals, people, and the environment is essential and symbiotic. “I think we just want to make sure that every vulnerable creature that is hurt by this, if they still have a chance to survive or be saved, that we can do that for them,” says Overton. In addition to PATH’s unflagging work, relief efforts and volunteers are pouring in from local, national, and global groups. While many coastal wildlife shelters have completely shifted gears to dedicate time, energy, and money towards aiding local animals, national groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and worldwide organizations such as International Bird Rescue Research Center (IBRRC) are working to rescue and defend animals. Like PATH, volunteers from IBRRC were on the scene within weeks of the spill, saving seabirds caught in the muck and mire. While animal-protection groups are saving lives every day, representatives from PETA are pursuing legal action against BP. In June, the group approached government officials to open a criminal investigation against BP, declaring that the oil company acted recklessly at the cost of animal suffering and death, which is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail in Louisiana. As hard-working volunteers help save local wildlife, companion animal shelters such as the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Animal Rescue of New Orleans are asking people across the country to not forget about the other group of suffering animals: companion animals abandoned by families forced from their homes. Many people living on the Gulf Coast have been financially devastated by the spill, and dogs and cats are ending up in overcrowded shelters as a result. The St. Bernard Parish rescue service had 127 dogs surrendered in June, in comparison to 17 surrendered in June 2009. Local shelters are seeking volunteers to sponsor, foster, or adopt displaced animals, as many are already at capacity. Photo courtesy of IBRRC "
THROW A VEGAN BABY SHOWER BASH IN 4 EASY STEPS,https://vegnews.com/2010/7/throw-a-vegan-baby-shower-bash-in-4-easy-steps,"JULY 18, 2010","For some, the idea of a baby shower may call up the sweet sound of a baby’s coo and visions of daffodils. For others, the sheer mention of the two words together might trigger PTSD-like symptoms, haunted by towering diaper cakes and chocolate melted to look like baby doo-doo. Either way, chances are if you’re veg, you might need a little help planning a beautiful, non-lame baby shower. So tell the mom-to-be to relax, VegNews has the planning done.  Décor
Like all parties, baby showers can be thrown with any theme you like. Stay away from decorations that will head straight to the dumpster after the party, such as balloons, paper plates, and crepe paper streamers. Instead, try embellishing with natural elements, such as organic flowers, or stack fruit from your local farmers’ market in vases. For a little something to spread on the table, vegan jellybeans are a sweet alternative to confetti. Once the party-planning wheels are turning, send out the invites—three weeks in advance to leave guests plenty of time to RSVP. For a unique take on the recycled paper invitation, try seed cards, like these from Bloomin’—the guests can plant the card after its arrival and watch it blossom.  Menu
What’s on the menu for your shower is nearly as important as Mom herself. If you’re aiming for elegance, try hosting an afternoon tea. Cucumber finger sandwiches are an easy and refreshing way to provide some lightness to a meal. If you’re looking for something a little more substantial, try the white bean bruschetta or California sushi rolls. Orange sugar cookies, pear and fig tarts or vanilla cupcakes with chocolate glaze are all sure to satisfy maternity cravings, and those of your guests as well. Games
There are plenty of fun baby shower pastimes to entertain your guests. Rather than signing a guest book, have an organic cotton onesie, like this one from Sweet Spud, for guests to sign with puff paint. Or have a onesie for each guest to personalize for Mom and baby. For more good wishes for the baby, use a larger flower or plant as a “wishing tree.” Supply guests with small, recycled paper leaves on which they can write wishes for the baby and safety pin to the plant. Gifts
For a mom-to-be, it can be a lifesaver to be showered with baby gifts to help her through the first few months of life with the little one. Luckily there are plenty of vegan and organic products out there for vegan babies. What’s cuter than vegan baby shoes? Or spring for organic baby clothes, such as this bunch that comes wrapped like flowers. To cut back on waste from wrapping paper, wrap your presents in baby blankets. For goodie bags, try vegan lip balm that you can personalize to commemorate the date of the shower. "

CAN YOU BE GREEN AND EAT MEAT?,https://vegnews.com/2010/7/can-you-be-green-and-eat-meat,"JULY 11, 2010","“Can you be a ‘good environmentalist’ and still eat meat?” This was the question on everyone’s mind on May 20 when VegNews and Earth Island Institute co-hosted a riveting debate with advocates on both sides of the fence. Howard Lyman, former cattle rancher-turned-veg activist, opposed Nicolette Hahn Niman, a vegetarian environmental attorney and spouse of Niman Ranch founder Bill Niman. Held at the David Brower Center in Berkeley, Calif., the sold-out house witnessed 90 minutes of compelling discussion, concluding in a question-and-answer segment (the full video can be seen here). Like most hot topics, time ran out before all the questions could be answered, leaving guests wanting more. In an exclusive post-debate interview, Lyman and Niman give more insight into the relationship of environmentalism and eating meat. VegNews: Let’s talk about the carbon footprint of grass-fed as opposed to corn-fed beef.
Howard Lyman: Grass-fed livestock raised on land that is unsuitable for cultivation has a much smaller footprint that those raised in a grain-fed environment. However, we need to make sure that they are not just the replacements in grain-fed feedlots. Unless grass-fed meat is 100-percent free of modern feeding practices, eating it makes a supposed environmentalist a true hypocrite.
Nicolette Hahn Niman: The four aspects of agriculture that cause greenhouse gases are: fossil-fuel burning vehicles (tractors, trucks, irrigation and ventilation systems, etc.); production of agricultural chemicals (pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers); liquefied manure systems; and enteric animal emissions. In the first three categories, grass-fed cattle is generally much better than grain-fed, especially if the cattle are on natural grasslands. In the fourth category, grass-fed can be higher, but mainly because grass-fed cattle live longer.
 
VN: Why doesn’t the meat industry label its products truthfully? “Natural” still uses anti-microbials; “grass-fed” is typically only 50-percent grass-fed and 50-percent grain; “organic” uses GMO vaccines; “local” is sometimes shipped across the country for slaughter.
NHN: I agree that there are some misleading food labels out there, but the problem is in no way limited to the meat industry. The best way to ensure that you’re really getting food that is produced in an environmentally sound manner is to learn about where your food—whether it’s meat, soy, or vegetables—comes from and how it’s produced. When I see people eating “soy jerky” manufactured in Taiwan from soy that probably came from Brazil, I cringe.
HL: Food corporations never want the shopper to know the conditions used to produce a product. Marketing deception is as common as the industry’s reluctance to allow visits to slaughter facilities. Truth gives the consumer too much information so they prefer false, catchy terminology to increase sales.
 
VN: If the planet’s population went vegan, is there enough arable land to produce food raised without animal manure or synthetic fertilizer to feed everyone?
HL: There is enough arable land to feed twice the current world population without using additional fertilizer, but we would have to return to growing food under proper plant rotation. Nature figured out plant nutrition long before humans started screwing it up. The works of John Jevons and Bill Mollison have proved this without doubt.
NHN: Possibly, but since 99 percent of the world’s people eat animal products, the more pertinent question is whether we can feed the world’s growing population with a diet that includes fish, meat, dairy, and eggs. That question was carefully examined for a 2009 report titled “Eating the Planet” prepared by two respected European think-tanks. It concluded that with a modest reduction in consumption of animal based foods by Westerners, the world could convert to pasture-based, organic agriculture and provide enough food for all people.
 
VN: Are our dietary choices the single most important choices we can make to lessen our negative impact on the environment? If not, what is?
NHN: It’s high on the list, but I would put reducing our massive over-consumption of all goods, especially plastics, even higher. Plastics are made from fossil fuels, do not degrade (they’re literally killing the oceans), and are a major suspect in rising cancer rates. As Westerners, our total “ecological footprint” is enormous, and that needs to be dramatically curtailed.
HL: While that may be true, dietary choices are the one issue we have total control over. There are many things devastating the environment, but we have little chance to impact them. Our diet we can control—or we fall victim to our addiction.
 
VN: Is a cow on a farm part of nature? What about hunting, specifically animals such as turkeys or wild pigs, which are abundant, non-native, and often destroy local habitats?
HL: A cow on a farm is about as natural as a politician is a teacher of the golden rule. Hunting turkeys and wild pigs in areas where they are non-native is a testament to the mistakes humans have made in the abuse of our environment.
NHN: Ruminants are an important part of the food system largely because of their miraculous ability to thrive on the naturally occurring vegetation of marginal lands that cannot be farmed. Regarding hunting, humans have wiped out most of the natural predators of many animals, so hunting is one way to help keep animal populations in balance with their natural ecosystems while simultaneously providing food for those who eat these animals.

ECO-VEG BUSINESS TO SUPPORT FOR A BETTER WORLD,https://vegnews.com/2010/7/eco-veg-business-to-support-for-a-better-world,"JULY 4, 2010","With the obvious overlap of veganism and environmentalism, it’s a logical progression for companies to adopt eco-friendly initiatives to complement their animal-free ethics. Whether you’ve taken a “green” step and gone veg or have been plant-based for years, there’s a blossoming market of all-veg businesses that take “cruelty-free” to the next, planet-friendly level. Deer Run Bed and Breakfast, an all-vegan destination in Big Pine Key, Fla., sports a stunning list of eco-vegan initiatives, including its pending LEED certification. With half of the guest rooms revamped with recycled fabrics, carpeting, and vintage furnishings, owners Jen DeMaria and Harry Appel are working with a LEED-accredited interior designer to complete the transformation. On the forefront of sustainable tourism, Deer Run’s grocery list of green initiatives includes organic vegan food (some grown on the grounds), linens, and cleaning products, cruelty-free toiletries, and rigorous composting, recycling, and rainwater collecting programs. “We are proving that sustainability as well as some profitability can co-exist,” says DeMaria. Cincinnati’s Park+Vine, an eco-convenience store, serves its community with the best veg products, local goods, and community-focused events. “There’s still a disconnect between environmentalism and veganism. Most environmentalists I know are eating fast food and don’t want to talk about the impact of their food choices. It’s a matter of convenience,” says owner Dan Korman. The store is home to events such as local wine tasting, eco-baby workshops, and animal shelter fundraisers. Across the country, another eco-veg powerhouse is still thriving after nearly 40 years. For Bob Goldberg and Paul Lewin, co-founders and owners of Follow Your Heart (FYH), the connection between planet and plate is an easy one. After starting Southern California’s landmark veg café in 1970 as a small, seven-seat snack bar, Goldberg’s vegetarian vision has grown to encompass a 7,000-square-foot store and café, seating more than 70 people and housing the best veg products for its loyal shoppers. Known to regulars and locals as “The Heart,” FYH also creates and produces the popular product line by the same name, including vegan mainstays Vegan Gourmet cheese and Vegenaise. Behind the scenes, it gets better—every FYH product is created using nothing but bright, California sunshine. Earth Island, FYH’s manufacturing plant located just miles from the store, operates on 100-percent solar energy thanks to more than 700 panels decorating the roof. In addition to creating more than enough energy to power the facility, the panels provide crucial shade to the sun-drenched building, keeping cooling costs lower than average. Inside this green machine, sustainability can be seen in everything, from the energy-efficient lighting and skylights, down to the recycled carpeting. With solar panels averaging a lifespan of 50 years, Goldberg and Lewin’s investment is a smart, earth-savvy move. With a smaller but expanding inventory, Park+Vine maintains its integrity by keeping a close eye on “greenwashing,” a term used to describe companies or products that promote a green advertising message but less in the final product or service. It’s easy for anyone to claim to be green, a label similar to “all natural” that carries no certification or weight on its own. And like diligently reading food labels in search of animal by-products, the eco parallel requires a bit of research to ensure consumers aren’t getting duped. “We’ve had pretty good luck with avoiding greenwashing in our inventory, but it’s still a lot of work. We’ve found that the smaller the vendor, the better. It’s easier to negotiate terms and confirm authenticity,” advises Korman. While the conscientious consumer requires a little footwork to guarantee ethical and eco-friendly products, there’s an upside to the money-driven greenwashing that’s sweeping the market. “Though I rarely shop at big supermarkets or retail stores, I think they’ve made green products very accessible and affordable, and that’s a start,” says Whitney Lauritsen, author of the blog Eco-Vegan Gal. “Regardless, I prefer to support small business with the environment at the forefront of their mission.” Like with most successful markets, the push for earth-friendly goods is bound to produce less-than-honest results. But business owners have proven there’s a thriving crop of vegan- and planet-friendly companies to serve this growing community. With the growing demand for sustainable businesses and as the vegan and environmental movements continue to merge, a reliable, honest supply of cruelty-free companies is sure to follow. "

Sullivan argues that such willful ignorance does not only apply to acts of violence against companion animals, but Americans similarly divorce themselves from feeing empathy for farm animals when they choose to eat meat.

WHY OUR SCHOOL LUNCHES NEED HELP AND WHAT YOU CAN DO,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/why-our-school-lunches-need-help-and-what-you-can-do,"JUNE 20, 2010","Part of my internship to become a registered dietitian was spent working at my local middle school. One cause for substandard school lunch choices lies within the mission of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA): Make sure our food is safe, and promote agribusiness domestically and abroad. To discover where “making food safe” smacks against “promote agribusiness” in schools, follow the money. Lunch menus must abide by the guidelines of the School Lunch and School Breakfast Program of the USDA. The minimal nutrition standards for lunch and breakfast incorporate the 1995 Dietary Guidelines for America. If guidelines aren’t met, the cafeterias lose federal money. Cafeteria directors develop menus from the government’s program, Team Nutrition. Team Nutrition menus are based on the foods normally available on the USDA Commodities list and grown by US agribusiness. The commodities are surplus products, which the government buys in big volume discounts from agribusiness. Started during the Great Depression in the 1930s, it connected farmers who had crops they couldn’t sell to feed school kids who were literally starving. It seemed like a match made in heaven. Today, schools’ commodity orders are made months in advance with a minimum of a third of a truckload per product. A case of white rice is around $20, while brown rice is around $60. In addition to the storage problem, it raises an important question—will kids eat the healthier product? Who will pay the price difference? Agribusiness controls most growing and selling of school foods regardless of nutrition. They successfully stopped government-mandated caps on sugar, calories, and sodium, and prevented required minimum fiber levels. Agribusiness has huge processing plants to supply products for the nation’s school lunches, practically eliminating small farmers who cannot match the discounts. If a school purchases 1 million pounds of potatoes at a low cost, they need to take possession immediately. Where do they put them? Giant food processing plants take them. If the processor doesn’t have baked potatoes instead of regular fries, the school lunch is stuck with fries. Cafeterias, not school districts, supply their own funds. Cafeteria monies pay employee costs, food, utilities, equipment and all other expenses. Schools receive $19.50 per student per year to buy from the commodities program. This will equal $844 million in 2010. Funding also comes from the USDA school meals programs. Students living at or below 130 percent of the poverty line qualify for free lunch, and the USDA pays the coffer $2.68. This has been the same amount since 1973. Today, this should cost $12.90. Pupil attendance is crucial because reimbursement comes from each eligible kid who attends school that day. On a snow day, reimbursement is forfeited. To pay for absenteeism, cafeterias sell the biggest food profit bang for the buck. Enter à la carte foods. À la carte foods are items sold for profit, such as French fries or salads. French fries have low labor costs, large profits, and extreme popularity. Salads have intense labor, low profit margin and low popularity. When profit is the driving predictor, it’s easy to see what is emphasized. What can you do? Have lunch at your local school. Talk with the food service director. Become a member of the school’s Wellness Committee. Every school must have a Wellness Committee to receive federal funds. Committees set nutrition and activity standards. You pay school taxes. You have a voice. Urge your senators and representatives to support the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, the school lunch reimbursement bill. Billions in increased funding and better nutrition standards are on the table. Help our kids fill their plates with healthier choices for a happier future. "

7 WAYS TO HAVE AN ECO-FRIENDLY SUMMER,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/7-ways-to-have-an-eco-friendly-summer,"JUNE 20, 2010","It seems like a no-brainer to go green this summer, but where do you start? These seven easy tips will help detox your life, so when the thermometer hits 80, you’ll already be cooler than a cucumber. Whether you start by eating locally, trading your gossip rags for smart reads, or taking your sustainable skateboard instead of the SUV, you’ll be healthier, happier, and greener in no time—without compromising style, flavor, or fun.  1. From store-bought to storefronts, vegan ice cream is becoming more and more common. If you don’t have a place like Lula’s Sweet Apothecary in New York City, it’s really easy to make homemade vegan ice creams with cookbooks, including the classic Vice Cream: Gourmet Vegan Desserts by Jeff Rogers. Once you’ve mastered the basics—chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry—branch out into adventurous flavors and pump up the dairy-free volume with a backyard ice cream bar.  2. If too much ice cream and too many veggie dogs are making your summer days feel lethargic, dive into a refreshing, healthy cleanse. If you’re not ready to forego your favorite solid foods, keep your temperature cool by eating or juicing lots of organic cukes. 3. Revamping your wardrobe with vegan summer fashions ensures that you’ll look your best from the Fourth of July until Labor Day. Branch out with bold colors, and non-leather plimsolls certainly fit the bill. Stay stylish with this season’s take on gladiator sandals: a versatile, high-ankle style with a summer feel by Wanted Shoes. 4. Don’t take “getaway” so literally! Take a trip within 100 miles and earn bonus points for riding a bus or a train to get there. If you want to get some sun during your summer staycation, make sure to use healthly, eco-friendly products to shield skin. Avoid toxic oxybenzone and protect tattoos with cruelty-free, eco-friendly sun block. Maybe you’ve racked up a hefty amount of vacation days and just need a transcontinental adventure—just remember to choose a green getaway. 5. Need a craft project? How about building your own eco-friendly surfboard from Greenlight Surf Supply? With recyclable foam and bamboo parts, you can hit the beach without hurting the ocean. 6. Commit to getting your produce from the farmers’ market, and talk to the farmers! Organic, local fruits and veggies are the greenest foods you can eat. Ready to grow your own organic greens? Sunny summer is the perfect season to start planting an organic veggie garden. Wild lawns can be beautiful, and homegrown food can feed your body and your budget. For more homegrown how-to tips, check out the urban gardening feature in VN’s July +August Anniversary issue. 7.

BOB HARPER GOES VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/bob-harper-goes-vegan,"JUNE 14, 2010","This week, celebrity trainer Bob Harper told VegNews that he has gone vegan, cutting all animal products out of his diet, and shared that the switch to a cruelty-free diet has improved his health. “I enjoy living a plant-based diet because it makes me feel clear headed and strong, not to mention my genetically high cholesterol dropped more than 100 points. That was all the motivation I needed,” says Harper. Famous for helping Americans slim down on NBC’s The Biggest Loser, Harper has been a longtime vegetarian, often promoting meat-free recipes. In addition to helping stars get fit and contestants shed pounds, the 44-year-old vegan trainer also teaches exercise classes through Crunch gym and has his own series of workout videos titled Bob Harper’s Inside Out Method.

MEAT CANCER RISK,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/meat-cancer-risk,"JUNE 14, 2010","A new study conducted by UK scientists at the University of Brighton in East Sussex concludes girls who eat a diet high in meat are more likely to begin puberty at a younger age, placing them at a higher risk for cancer. Researchers found that 49 percent of girls eating more than 12 servings of meat per week at the age of seven would begin menstruation by 12 and a half years of age. Previous scientific studies have shown that girls who begin menstruating in early adolescence are at greater risk for developing diseases including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and heart disease. "
ANIMAL CRUELTY SYNDROME,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/animal-cruelty-syndrome,"JUNE 13, 2010","On June 7, The New York Times published an article examining the connection between cruelty to animals and other criminal behaviors, including crimes against humans, which it dubbed the Animal Cruelty Syndrome. The story cited examples such as the link between dog fighting and domestic violence, and explores the pathology behind cruelty to animals being a precursor to serial killer murder sprees. While the link between cruelty to companion animals and humans is discussed at length, the article doesn’t approach cruelty to farm animals, despite the recent public consciousness about factory-farm cruelty documented by animal-rights investigations. "
CANADA ANIMAL ABUSERS,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/canada-animal-abusers,"JUNE 11, 2010","In 2010, Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Quebec claimed the most egregious records for animal abuse and neglect in Canada according to a new report from the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF). The report examined the animal protection laws of each jurisdiction, researching 12 separate categories of laws and provisions throughout hundreds of statues to compile the list. The organization also considered the varying laws covering animal rights and welfare, and concluded that conditions are the worst for animals living in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. For the second year in a row, Ontario was named the best Canadian province for animals. "
VEGAN BRAINS UNIQUE,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/vegan-brains-unique,"JUNE 11, 2010","A recently released study has found that vegan brains and omnivore brains respond differently to images of animal cruelty. Italian researchers compared the MRI scans of 60 adults, pulling from a pool of 21 vegans, 20 omnivores, and 19 vegetarians and found that vegans and vegetarians used alternate parts of the brain controlling empathy and social cognition when confronted with images of animal cruelty. The scientists behind the study initially theorized that vegan brains would respond differently to animal suffering based on their ethics and empathy. "

Environmental organizations the world over are decrying the decision, saying that lifting the ban contradicts Obama’s campaign promise to end the slaughter of whales. Currently, it is internationally illegal to hunt whales for commercial purposes, but Japan, Norway, and Iceland claim to hunt whales for scientific research, although the number of slaughtered whales continues to rise every year. The International Whaling Commission convenes next on June 20, when the proposed repeal will be voted on. "

As a condition of its settlement, the Maine-based factory farm will pay $130,000 in fines and restitution, and must allow state officials to conduct random inspections of the premises for the next five years. The civil case was filed following an undercover investigation released by Mercy For Animals (MFA), which included video footage of animal abuse and neglect such as reckless, inhumane slaughter and dead hens left rotting near egg-laying hens. According to MFA, the landmark case is thought to be the largest monetary penalty charged against a factory farm in US history. "

7 ECO-VEGAN FASHIONS THAT FIT VEGANS JUST RIGHT,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/7-eco-vegan-fashions-that-fit-vegans-just-right,"JUNE 6, 2010","If the words “vegan” and “fashion” conjure up images of hemp skirts that could double as tents, you’re thinking of ’90s eco clothing-practical, but hardly chic. Enter 2010, a time when top designers such as VN’s March+April issue cover gal Leanne Mai-Ly Hilgart of Vaute Couture or Matt & Nat’s Inder Bedi are changing the face of cruelty-free fashion by creating clothing that isn’t only green, but also animal-friendly, thanks to fabulous, fashionable alternatives to wool, leather, fur, and silk. Some of these animal-free textiles are not exactly new, but rediscovered and repurposed in our era of environmental consciousness. Browsing online, you can shop at companies pioneering eco clothing and at new green boutiques that are cashing in on the current wave of demand. Make sure to look for outfitters who use the following earth-friendly threads. Bamboo
Comparable to cotton and silk, bamboo gets an “A” for its list of benefits: organic, sustainable, biodegradable, and extremely comfortable. Even better, the world’s fastest growing plant doesn’t require fertilizers or pesticides. PET
Made from recycled plastic soda bottles, this polyester finds new life as warm fleece hoodies. After the bottles are separated at recycling plants, they’re chopped, melted and stirred. The resulting liquid is thick and yields polyester strands, which are stretched to make threads. Recyclable Polyester
Recycled fabrics are used to make clothing out of clothing. Some companies even have garment recycling programs where used clothes are reborn, good-as-new. Soy Fabric
A renewable natural resource and byproduct of food production, soy wear is easy to clean and similar to wool in its heat retention. First made into a snazzy suit for Henry Ford in the 1940s, the demand for soy is on the rise thanks to conscious consumers. Organic Cotton
This choice, quickly gaining popularity, is poised to eclipse traditional cotton, which accounts for half of all pesticide use in the US and a quarter of that used throughout the world. Silk Substitutes
Synthetics like nylon, polyester and lyocell—better known by its brand name, Tencel—have a similar look and feel as silk, minus the cruelty. The nonprofit organization Green America recommends Tencel over rayon; although both are wood-based, turning wood into rayon requires a tremendous amount of water and chemicals. The organization reports that only about one-third of the pulp obtained from a tree will end up in finished rayon thread. Tencel manufacturers insist that production of their product doesn’t harm the environment, but these claims have not been independently verified. Manmade Materials
If wearing faux leather doesn’t rub your ethics the wrong way, scope out the variety of manmade imitations currently flooding mainstream stores nationwide. Leather alternatives are easy to find and more affordable, to boot—most designer discount shoe stores carry synthetic shoes that have the look and feel of leather. Look for labels that identify the shoe as “manmade leather,” “synthetic,” “all man-made materials” or “pleather.” If you’re looking to spend more on designer lines, upscale stores such as Nordstrom, Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue also carry synthetic alternatives. Keep in mind that synthetic materials, often petroleum based, aren’t necessarily eco-friendly, but shoes made with hemp, bamboo, soy, and rubbers are. "
VEGAN CLASSES IN DALLAS,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/vegan-classes-in-dallas,"JUNE 5, 2010","Christy Morgan, aka The Blissful Chef, is bringing vegan cooking to Dallas, Texas.

Previously, students who opted out of eating meat- and dairy-laden lunches were required to have a doctor’s note before having another meal made available. "

UN SAYS GO VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2010/6/un-says-go-vegan,"JUNE 3, 2010","On Wednesday, the UN released a report stating that a global move toward a vegan diet is essential to save the world from hunger and the impacts of climate change. The report asserts that as the global population rises and the demand for food grows, the only sustainable model of eating is relying on plant-based foods. In addition to meeting population growth, the study also lists the damaging and far-reaching consequences of eating animals, concluding that factory-farming practices are as harmful to the environment as burning fossil fuels. Last year, the UN released a similar report declaring that food production would need to increase globally by 70 percent by 2050 to sustain the population. "

READ JOHN ROBBINS’ THE GOOD LIFE BEFORE ANYONE ELSE,https://vegnews.com/2010/5/read-john-robbins-the-good-life-before-anyone-else,"MAY 30, 2010","John Robbins could have inherited the well-known Baskin Robbins ice cream chain, but instead he has dedicated his life to advocating for a more compassionate, just world. Through his books, including the international bestseller Diet for a New America, Robbins supplements his activism and humanitarian work with the written word. Now releasing his sixth book, The New Good Life: Living Better Than Ever in an Age of Less, Robbins is inspiring readers to shift their focus from acquiring wealth to living compassionate, sustainable lives. The Good Life Doesn’t Have to Cost the Planet
By John Robbins It’s important to be thrifty and save. But a truly fulﬁlling life requires more than frugality. It also requires, I believe, a sense of purpose that is connected to something greater than ourselves. For me, this means living with gratitude and respect for all life, caring for others, and being part, if I can, of restoring the earth. For the ten years that my wife, Deo, and I lived on an island off the coast of British Columbia, we grew 90 percent of our own food. Everything we grew was entirely organic. Although the phrase “carbon footprint” didn’t exist back then, ours was very small. We had no livestock because we didn’t want to kill animals for food, since there was other food we could grow or buy that provided all the nourishment we needed. Some may think I am overly sentimental, but I’ve known too many animals who’ve felt like family to me. When I see a wild bird in ﬂight, my instinct is not to grab a gun to shoot and kill it. My desire is to appreciate its beauty and understand its place in the web of life. In the years since our time on the island, I’ve learned a great deal about how animals are treated in modern factory farms, and what I’ve learned has changed me yet again. I won’t describe it in gory detail, because you’ve probably seen pictures or heard stories of how bad it is—of the concentration camp conditions these animals are forced to endure. But I will tell you that in reality it’s every bit as bad as—or worse than—you’ve heard. All of the animals involved in modern meat production—cattle, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and so forth—are kept in conditions that violate their essential natures, that frustrate even their most basic needs, that cause them incomprehensible suffering. You don’t have to be a vegetarian, nor even a particularly compassionate person, to be disgusted by the level of cruelty that takes place every day in modern meat production. Julia Child, the famous chef, author, and TV personality, used to dismiss vegetarians as sappy. But when, late in her life, I took her to visit a veal production facility, she was horriﬁed by what she saw. “I had no idea it was so severe,” she told me. All this leaves me with a question that I think we need, as a society, to ask: How is it that we call some animals “pets,” lavish our love on these animals, and get so much in return—and yet then we turn around and call other animals “dinner” and feel justiﬁed, by virtue of this semantic distinction, in treating these animals with any level of cruelty so long as it lowers the price per pound? The cruelties inherent in modern meat production are so intense that it’s hard to eat these products and honor compassion at the same time. If you eat any kind of meat, you might want to purchase products that you know to be truly free-range and organic, such as those with the “Animal Compassion” logo from Whole Foods Market. Because I so deeply deplore cruelty to animals, and I’ve been publicly active in bringing attention to the systematic cruelty in modern meat production, people often ask me if my reluctance to eat meat stems from ethical reasons. Yes, it does, and yet over the years I’ve learned something else that has also affected me greatly. As a concerned citizen of our beautiful but endangered planet, I want to do whatever I can to help protect the fragile biosystems on which so much depends, so that your children and mine, and all generations yet to come, might have a chance for a viable future. What does that have to do with eating meat? A lot more than you might think. In 2006, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations released a seminal report titled “Livestock’s Long Shadow.” The report states that meat production is the second or third largest contributor to environmental problems at every level and at every scale, from global to local. It is a primary culprit in land degradation, air pollution, water shortage, water pollution, species extinction, loss of biodiversity, and climate change. Henning Steinfeld, a senior author of the report, stated, “Livestock are one of the most signiﬁcant contributors to today’s most serious environmental problems. Urgent action is needed to remedy the situation.” As Ezra Klein wrote in The Washington Post in 2009, “The evidence is strong. It’s not simply that meat is a contributor to global warming; it’s that it is a huge contributor. Larger, by a signiﬁcant margin, than the global transportation sector.” In his inﬂuential documentary An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore presents a compelling argument for the seriousness of human-induced global warming. But for some reason he asks us to change our lightbulbs while never asking us to change our diets. Seeing this omission, I’ve realized how deeply we are conditioned to think of meat eating as the reward for afﬂuence and how difﬁcult it can be to question it. Meat eating has held such a central place in the old good life that it can just slip by, unquestioned. But question it we must if we are going to take seriously our responsibility to the planet. Cattle are notorious for producing methane, which is one of the four primary greenhouse gases. You may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to take cow burps and ﬂatulence seriously, but livestock emissions are no joke. Methane comes from both ends of the cow in such enormous quantities that scientists seriously view it as one of the greatest threats to our earth’s climate. And there’s more. The FAO report states that livestock production generates 65 percent of the nitrous oxide (another extremely potent greenhouse gas) produced by human activities. The FAO concludes that overall, livestock production is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, a bigger share than all the SUVs, cars, trucks, buses, trains, ships, and planes in the world combined.

Similarly, a 2009 report published in Scientiﬁc American remarked that “producing beef for the table has a surprising environmental cost: it releases prodigious amounts of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.” The greenhouse gas emissions from producing a pound of beef, the study found, are 58 times greater than those from producing a pound of potatoes. Some people thought the Live Earth concert handbook was exaggerating when it stated that, “Refusing meat is the single most effective thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint,” but it wasn’t. This is literally true. Even Environmental Defense, a group that was called George W. Bush’s favorite environmental group for its less-than-radical stands, calculates that if every meat eater in the United States swapped just one meal of chicken per week for a vegetarian meal, the carbon savings would be equivalent to taking half a million cars off the road. People have begun comparing eating little or no animal products with driving a Prius (“Vegetarianism is the new Prius”) and likewise compared eating meat with driving a Hummer. But this comparison, as striking as it is, actually understates the amount of greenhouse gases that stem from meat. In 2006, a University of Chicago study found that a vegan diet is far more effective than driving a hybrid car in reducing our carbon footprint. Scientists who have done the calculations say that a Prius driver who consumes a meat-based diet actually contributes more to global warming than a Hummer driver who eats low on the food chain. Then, in late 2009, Worldwatch Institute published a seminal report that took things further. The thoughtful and meticulously thorough study, written by World Bank agricultural scientist Robert Goodland, who spent 23 years as the Bank’s lead environmental adviser, and Jeff Anhang, an environmental specialist for the Bank, came to the conclusion that animals raised for food account for more than half of all human-caused greenhouse gases. Eating plants instead of animals, the authors state, would be by far the most effective strategy to reverse climate change, because it “would have far more rapid effects on greenhouse gas emissions and their atmospheric concentrations-and thus on the rate that the climate is warming-than actions to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.” I often see very well-intentioned people going to all sorts of lengths to live a greener lifestyle. It’s sadly ironic that they sometimes ignore what would be the single most effective thing they could be doing. If we are really committed to saving the environment we need to know where our leverage is. We need to focus on where we can get the most beneﬁt. Eating lower on the food chain is a real boon to the whole earth community. The good life doesn’t have to cost the planet. The question we will collectively answer with our lives in the coming years is this: Are we going to take the earth’s needs into account, or are we going to indulge our appetites without regard for the impact we’re having on the environment? The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was released at the end of 2007, was the largest and most detailed summary of the climate change situation ever undertaken. Its authors included thousands of scientists from dozens of countries. It unequivocally predicted serious risks and damages to species, ecosystems, human infrastructure, societies, and livelihoods in the future unless drastic action to reduce warming was taken. Summarizing our current predicament, the Worldwatch Institute says that if we do not radically change course, “Children born today will ﬁnd their lives preoccupied with a host of hardships created by an inexorably warming world. Food supplies will be diminished and many of the world’s forests will be destroyed. Not just the coral reefs that nurture many ﬁsheries but the chemistry of the oceans will face disruption.” And one more thing: We all know that everyone needs to eat, but we tend to overlook the fact that it’s not efficient to cycle grain through animals. The production of a pound of feedlot beef requires sixteen pounds of corn and soybeans. That’s why the noted author Frances Moore Lappé called modern meat production “a protein factory in reverse.” From the point of view of world hunger, if you feed corn and soybeans to livestock, you’re actually wasting most of the protein and other nutrients that you’ve grown. If you think about the vast numbers of people who are starving on our planet, it begins to look like a crime against humanity to take 80 percent of the corn and soybeans grown in the U.S. today and feed it to livestock. But that is exactly what we are doing, so we can have cheap meat. Cheap, that is, if you don’t count the human suffering that is and will be caused by climate deterioration, the cruelty to billions of animals, and the unmet food needs of hundreds of millions of people. It’s striking to me how much correlation there is between the food choices that are the healthiest, those that are the least expensive, and those that are most socially and environmentally responsible. It is a fact of singular signiﬁcance today that eating lower on the food chain—eating more plants and fewer animals—addresses all of these goals in a positive way. While efforts to use government as an agent of social change don’t have the best reputation, this could be an instance in which such an approach might be useful. Since we have taxes, why don’t we tax the things that are bad for the world and use some of that money to lower the price of things that are good? This would be a revenue-neutral way of fostering a better world. For example, what if we taxed agrochemicals and used the revenue to subsidize organic and other safe forms of growing food? What if we taxed junk food and used the income to subsidize fresh fruits and vegetables? What if we taxed white bread and used the revenue to lower the price of whole wheat bread? What if we taxed products that are responsible for a disproportionate share of greenhouse gases, such as meat, and used the money to subsidize vegetable gardens and fruit orchards in every school and neighborhood in the country? The results would be impressive: We’d have genuinely happy meals, because we’d be eating far better and at far less expense. We’d be so much healthier as people that what we’d save in medical bills would go a long way toward solving the crisis in the health care system. And we’d dramatically reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases and thus have a more stable climate. "

6 TIPS TO GET YOUR VEGAN START-UP UP AND RUNNING,https://vegnews.com/2010/5/6-tips-to-get-your-vegan-start-up-up-and-running,"MAY 16, 2010","So what, exactly, will it take to make your dream of your very own veg business a reality? Unless you happen to have what’s known in business as an “angel investor,” who has absolutely limitless coffers and is completely happy to let you plunder them, you’re going to need some funding. Sites like businessknowhow.net and resourcenation.com offer calculators for projecting your actual costs, depending on what type of business you want to open. When it comes down to the financial side of things, here’s a basic look at what you can expect to need for the first year. Rent
No shock here, but remember that if you’re going to be doing any remodeling before your official grand opening, you’ll need to have enough money in the bank to cover rent before you see your first customer. Wages and benefits
Yes, if you want people to work for you, you’ll have to pay them. “Internships” will only get you so far. Nationwide, minimum wage is now $7.25 per hour. Vegan Mainstream, a plant-based public relations and marketing company, is a great place to post vegan and eco-friendly jobs, as is VN’s very own VegJobs resource site. Legal fees
Will you be an LLC or an Inc.? Do any patents or copyrights coming into play? It’s even a good idea to get a set of legal-eagle eyes on all your contracts, preferably before you sign them. Shelling out for legal advice up front can certainly save you the hassle of lawsuits later in your business life. Branding
For a brand-new business, establishing your brand is important for beginning a relationship with your customers. Work with a professional to design a memorable logo, business cards, and website. Build-out
Tables and chairs? Ovens, freezers, desks, desk lamps, or display cases? How about painting over the dreadful mauve left by your space’s previous tenants? Depending on the business you choose to go into, plan on some hardware expenses. Tips From The Top

WHAT VEGANS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT FOOD LANGUAGE,https://vegnews.com/2010/5/what-vegans-should-know-about-food-language,"MAY 9, 2010","Call it marketing, re-branding, or the assuaging of guilt, but today it seems that people want to be as far removed as possible from the facts about the food that they eat. Jarring hybrids have been created to change the way we conceptualize eating meat, from “chicken tenders,” to “buffalo wings.” Many omnivorous menu item names offer a fantasy too far removed from reality to elicit empathy or compassion. Even if most people realize that the meat they order is a dead animal, a disconnect still remains. In our everyday use of language, we choose words that ease our discomfort and inure us to that which might be ugly, dirty, violent, or just discomforting. We speak of “friendly fire” and “collateral damage” to refer to victims of war. Dumps are now “transfer stations,” and used cars are “previously owned vehicles.” Similarly, we tend to sugarcoat what we eat with language that conceals what we’re actually putting in our mouths. The euphemisms used to refer to meat, dairy, and eggs contribute to our disconnection with the source of these products: the animals themselves. For example, the word “meat” is preferred over “flesh” or even “animal,” and it’s generally discouraged to refer to the pigs, cows, and deer offered up for our gustatory pleasure. Instead, we order pork, beef, and venison. When an animal lies dead on the side of the road, we call it a carcass, but when an animal lies dead on our plate, we call it dinner. Many of the words we use to refer to animals’ body parts are equally innocuous, such as bacon, ribs, steak, hamburger, meatball, ham, pepperoni, roast, ground beef, sirloin, and chuck. We don’t say “prime cuts of pig” or “thin slices of calves.” As the result of successful desensitization, we seem to be able to refer to specific body parts without squeamishness, such as leg, breast, rib, wings, rump, loin, and flank, though we arbitrarily draw the line at tongues, feet, heads, intestines, and stomachs. Of course, words from other languages make animal parts seem even more edible: caviar, foie gras, pâté-menu items that many people might not order if they were in English. “Escargot” certainly sounds more appetizing than “snails.” Strangely, we can order without compunction “chicken,” “turkey,” “duck,” and “goose,” but the slightest alteration makes people squirm. Try asking someone if they eat “chickens,” “ducks,” and “geese,” and it’s as if they’re recognizing the animals for the first time. People have no problem eating “chicken,” but they’ll writhe when you ask them if they eat “chickens.” Using euphemisms to refer to the anonymous victims of our appetites not only belittles and commodifies animals, minimizes their suffering, and legitimizes and conceals our institutionalized use and abuse of them, it also desensitizes us to our own truth, values, and compassion. That’s a pretty high price to pay for a few old habits that can easily be replaced with just a little effort. One of the joys of becoming vegetarian is that there is no need to euphemize, assuage, pretend, or romanticize. You can look at the truth squarely in the face and, well, call a carrot a carrot. "
FOIE GRAS POLLUTION,https://vegnews.com/2010/5/foie-gras-pollution,"MAY 9, 2010","On May 6, Hudson Valley Foie Gras, the nation’s largest foie gras factory farm, was issued an injunction by a federal court in New York, barring them from continuing to violate the Clean Water Act and requiring the company to alter its practices. The ruling was the result of a lawsuit filed by the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), who argued that the company was routinely breaking the law by disposing animal waste into a local river and harming animals, the environment, and local residents. Foie gras, a French delicacy, is a perennially controversial dish that is manufactured by extracting the livers of overfed factory-farmed geese. "
URBAN REFORESTATION 101,https://vegnews.com/2010/5/urban-reforestation-101,"MAY 9, 2010","City-dwelling environmentalists across the country are building urban-reforestation coalitions, or arborist-activist groups committed to greening concrete jungles. With Arbor Day fast approaching—a 138-year-old tree-appreciation day—this is the perfect occasion to revisit some of the positive effects of urban reforesting. Trees, Please
The benefits of trees in urban areas extend from civic pride to personal wellness. Beautification is an obvious boon—brilliant colors supplant an otherwise gray wasteland—but that’s only the beginning. Urban foresting helps conceal visual pollution like bright streetlights, telephone poles, and parked cars. Because trees promote a pleasant pedestrian environment, folks are likelier to feel civic pride and a stronger sense of collective ownership of the streets. This fosters an increased communal desire to dispose of trash and recyclables in the proper receptacles, sweep the sidewalk in front of one’s stoop, and keep the streets safe. Carbon monoxide and other noxious gasses from tailpipe emissions pose a real public health concern, and trees planted in urban areas clean up the ozone. Trees also help protect pedestrians from rain and provide shade from the sun, while muffling urban noise. What’s more, the Urban Forest Ecosystems Institute (UFEI) estimates that shade from urban trees can decrease household and business energy bills between 15 and 35 percent. Kathleen Wolf, MD, a University of Washington environmental psychologist and US Forest Service appointee, has conducted research indicating that trees have a calming and healing effect that engenders psychological health and positive public behavior. Local businesses also thrive under urban tree canopies. According to studies conducted by Dr. Wolf’s research team, greenery attracts shoppers and spurs economic growth-people are more likely to spend time milling about and leisurely browsing. Given Main Street competition with corporate-dominated markets, trees give local business owners a boost. For every $100 in consumer spending at local businesses, $45 remains in the community—compared with 13 percent when shopping at retail chains—stimulating overall municipal economic growth, according to Stay Local!. Furthermore, businesses and homes on tree-lined streets stand to benefit from property-value increases of up to 10 percent, according to the United States Forest Services. Increased property value translates into a larger tax base, which can funnel more money into the local government for public works projects such as park and road maintenance. Trees’ benefits on city government go even further—they absorb precipitation, minimizing runoff and urban flooding, and tree shade protects concrete sidewalks. According to the UFEI, trees lengthen the life of concrete surfaces by 40 to 60 percent by reducing concrete’s expansion and contraction to accommodate temperature differences between day and night. Plant It
Urban reforestation organizations exist across the US—groups such as Friends of the Urban Forest in San Francisco and the nationally sweeping Urban Forest Project, which has groups around the country. These nonprofits educate the public about how vital trees are to urban landscapes, host tree-planting parties, and teach citizens how they can make a difference themselves. This Arbor Day, do your city a favor and learn how you can contribute to tree-planting efforts. "

The proposal states that black leather shoes were introduced as part of a required school uniform during Britain’s colonial rule of India, and that by replacing them with canvas shoes, the country can choose its own, more eco-friendly, option. Representatives of CISCE say that the move will benefit schoolchildren and their families, as leather shoes require routine cleaning, polishing, and maintenance while canvas shoes are more comfortable and durable.

GET INSIDE THE HEAD OF VEG AUTHOR ROBIN BRANDE,https://vegnews.com/2010/5/get-inside-the-head-of-veg-author-robin-brande,"MAY 2, 2010","Robin Brande discovered her passion for writing when she was 10 years old, “but by the time I graduated from college with an English degree, [writing] didn’t seem like a practical career.” Thankfully, her mindset changed and she left her law career for a world of life lessons, teenage romance, and the scientific method. Brande is happily pursuing her childhood dream and inspiring a new generation of young women. While researching her second novel, Fat Cat, Brande uncovered the truth behind factory farming and embraced veganism almost overnight. Now, the accomplished author weaves another lesson of compassion with her words, helping veg lit reach the mainstream. With two successful young-adult novels to her name, Brande is currently toiling away on her newest tale, Parallelogram, due out in 2011. VegNews: Do you feel that you have a social responsibility as a writer?
Robin Brande: I feel a huge responsibility. I write primarily for young adults, and I’m very conscious both of being a positive role model myself, and of providing positive role models in my novels. I try never to preach, but just to open up a conversation and show readers another way to look at things. VN: How can the written word be used as a form of activism?
RB: I think there are two ways to go about it. One is to print the unflinching truth, no matter how unattractive and difficult it is for people to read. The other method, and one that I use, is to weave it into our work and let people come to it sideways. Sometimes a gentle introduction can lead people to want to do more investigation on their own. That’s certainly what happened to me. VN: What themes are most recurrent in your work? What are your favorite subjects to explore?
RB: My novels all involve science of some sort—evolution, health and nutrition, quantum physics—but the main theme is transformation. The young women in my novels find what it takes within themselves to become stronger, more confident, happier, better able to be who they really are, no matter who’s pressuring them to be otherwise. Plus, I always throw in some romance, because science always goes better with some kissing. VN: What do you see in the future of veganism and animal rights?
RB: People want to be well. People want to do the right thing. The food and health care industries are already pushing people toward wanting better, saner solutions on how to live right. Maybe, as with global warming, all it will take is one person, one event—ike maybe Oprah going back to veganism after that brief flirtation with it—to open people’s eyes. VN: Are you involved with other social causes? Do you see an intersection with animal rights?
RB: My core group is girls and young women. I want them to be safe, independent, healthy, and strong. Many societies still treat their young women as property, as something to be sold or used and tossed away. Cruelty is cruelty. If you’re working for peace in this world, there are plenty of places to dive in, whether it’s for animal or human rights. The great thing about being vegan is you can do that and work for other causes while you’re at it. VN: Tell us about your upcoming novel, Parallelogram.
RB: It’s about a high school science genius, who uses her knowledge of quantum physics and string theory to bridge the gap into the next universe over, where she meets another version of herself who is very different from how she is here. She has to figure out how to become more like that girl than her own, less-exciting self. It’s all based on my own secret wish that I were Xena or someone cool like that. "

Bourke attributes the rise in meat-free eateries to greater public awareness concerning the health and environmental benefits gained from eating vegetarian food. Two high-end, plant-based restaurants celebrated grand openings in April: veg-friendly Italian eatery Amico Bio and a second location of all-vegan Saf. The increase of more vegetarian options isn’t only to satisfy cruelty-free palates, as Bourke suggests that many omnivores are now choosing to reduce meat consumption. "

Researchers estimate that more than 100 million frogs are removed from the wild annually for food production. In addition to human consumption, amphibians are at risk due to habitat loss and pollution. "

Startling statistics about US consumerism—including that Americans spent $18 billion in 2009 on coffee—are used drive the video’s message home. Rock band Gomez lent its song “How We Operate” to the video. "

RISING RECORD MEAT PRICES,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/rising-record-meat-prices,"APRIL 27, 2010","On Monday, financial analysts at Bloomberg L.P. predicted that meat prices are set to reach record highs as early as June, and that many consumers may reduce their meat consumption as a result. The sharp spike in retail prices is due to factory farms reducing their slaughters to the smallest size in decades, a move that was forced by increasing feed costs connected to the need for more ethanol. Researchers estimate that domestic meat supply may plummet to a 13-year low as a result of the push by former President George W. Bush to increase ethanol levels. With the unemployment rate nearing a 26-year high, analysts expect consumers to shy away from exorbitantly overpriced meat products. "

ANIMAL FEED CAUSES SMOG,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/animal-feed-causes-smog,"APRIL 26, 2010","Findings released last Wednesday from a study on the causes of smog in San Joaquin Valley, Calif., suggest that cattle feed, not just automotive exhaust, may be responsible for the area’s high levels of ozone gas. San Joaquin Valley, a moderately populated agricultural community, exhibits greater smog rates than more densely populated and car-centric cities. Scientists say that the greater rates are due to how fermented livestock feed interacts with automotive exhaust. Emissions of reactive organic gases produced by livestock combine with combustion emissions from gasoline-powered vehicles and sunlight to form smog. The study suggests that there is a direct relationship between a reduction in animal consumption and decreased environmental impact. "

THE COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WANT YOU TO PLEDGE VEG,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/the-college-students-who-want-you-to-pledge-veg,"APRIL 25, 2010","Students for Animal Rights (StAR), a coalition uniting activists from university campuses across the country, is promoting its third annual 2010 International College Veg Pledge initiative. The movement calls upon college students to commit to a vegan diet for the month of May, and organizers hope to recruit up to 25,000 students to go meat-free. Three years ago, StAR was founded in order to unify animal-rights activists at Ivy League universities. Today, the organization has expanded to create a global alliance of compassionate college students. With reps at almost 50 college campuses, students from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, England, Estonia, France, Germany, Mexico, and New Zealand have so far taken the 2010 College Veg Pledge. Between juggling a full course load, tirelessly campaigning for animal welfare, and preparing for his new job with The Humane League, StAR Outreach Coordinator Kenny Torrella found some time to catch up with VegNews and talk about his efforts with the College Veg Pledge. VegNews: What are some of the most effective strategies for reaching out to other young people and sharing the veg lifestyle?
Kenny Torrella: I think it’s important to show people the broad impact of their food choices. I know that most college students want to make a difference in the world, but they just don’t know how, or feel that as individuals they won’t have any real impact. VN: How is social networking and new media becoming the modern face of animal-rights activism?
KT: I think footage of factory farming gets students interested in the vegan lifestyle because they see where their food really comes from. And what gets students really excited are vegan food blogs. We’re big fans of Vegan Crunk! VN: What are some tips for college students ready to go vegan, but not sure how to make it happen?
KT: It’s important to become a part of your local veg community, whether it’s a student club, a meetup.com group, or an advocacy organization-try to get involved! Transitioning to veganism was easy for me because I had a community with whom to share recipes, eat and talk. If you’re on the other end, as an organizer, I’ve learned how important it is to build up a community, to make others feel welcome. Host potlucks and parties and get people connected to one another. VN: How do you see StAR growing?
KT: The core idea of StAR is power in unity. The collegiate movement for farm animals is energized and impassioned, but it is also heavily fragmented. The inevitable result is that college groups all over the map are constantly reinventing the wheel or feeling isolated and powerless and getting burned out. With today’s online social networking tools, there’s no excuse anymore for this sort of fragmentation. There’s no reason why every single college group advocating for farm animals can’t be connected with every other group across the globe. StAR is about cultivating a team spirit and collaborative relationships between college animal advocacy groups, so we can thrive on mutual inspiration, learn from each other’s mistakes, build on each other’s successes, and boost our collective potential. VN: What do you foresee for the vegan movement in the next 10 years?
KT: I think veganism will continue to become more mainstream. Some of the world’s top celebrities are outspoken about veganism, which not only reaches out to their audience, but also has an impact on our culture as a whole. I also foresee farm animals continually receiving more protection under legislation like California’s Prop 2 and this year’s Ohioans for Humane Farms ballot initiative. "
ANIMAL FACTORY IN TIME,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/animal-factory-in-time,"APRIL 25, 2010","On Friday, Time Magazine online published a Q&A article with Animal Factory author David Kirby. A journalist by trade, Kirby discusses his research into factory farms, talking about the unnatural diets, growth hormones, and antibiotics to which farm animals are subjected. He explains that the government euphemizes factory farm facilities by referring to them as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs, which makes it easier to reduce “a beef cow [into] an animal unit.” Through use of a chilling anecdote about a pig farm, Kirby discusses the inhumane treatment of animals in factory farms and also addresses the environmental pollution that attends this industrial-farming system.

PRIZED VEGAN POET BENJAMIN ZEPHANIAH,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/prized-vegan-poet-benjamin-zephaniah,"APRIL 18, 2010","It’s easy to get behind on reading, especially once warm and sunny spring weather turns every weekend into an excuse for day-long biking, hiking, or downtown shopping. Since stimulating your mind is just as important as energizing your body, try grabbing a book to dive into on your next outdoor outing-or to have on hand in case of April showers! At the VNHQ, we can’t get enough of a good vegan thing, and the prolific poetry of plant-based Benjamin Zephaniah is no exception. So, in honor of National Poetry Month, get to know this writer, spoken-word poet, and vegan activist a little bit better. Benjamin Zephaniah
“I’m just a poet! I just write poems in my bedroom,” Benjamin Zephaniah modestly pleads. The British poet’s humble demeanor comes naturally, despite the laundry list of accomplishments the 52-year-old boasts. Performing poetry since the age of 11 (the same year he shunned meat from his plate), Zephaniah has since grown into one of Britain’s favorite poets, recently ranking number three on BBC’s poetry poll-behind only T.S. Eliot and John Donne. Besides being the only black, vegan poet to make the list, Zephaniah is also the only living poet to be included in the top 10. His poem “Talking Turkeys” is one of the UK’s most beloved, staking its claim as the veg movement’s mantra, as well as provoking omnivores to think about their feathered brethren. “I got lots of friends who are turkeys/An all of dem fear christmas time/Dey wanna enjoy it, dey say humans destroyed it/An humans are out of dere mind,” writes Zephaniah. His language is approachable, digestible, and ultimately influential. Practically illiterate until he was 21 (Zephaniah left school at 13), he overcame major race and class issues, traveled the world as an artist, spread spoken-word poetry to the masses, and advocated for all-inclusive social justice. “Those people who can attack people because of the color of their skin, or can deny people human rights, have to deny that these people have real emotions and feelings and feel pain. That’s exactly what a lot of people who abuse animals say. ‘It’s not real pain. They don’t have feelings in the way that we have feelings,’” says Zephaniah. The intersection of causes is evident in his work, complemented by his bourgeoning activism. A patron of Viva!, The Vegan Society, and the Dr. Hadwen Trust, Zephaniah has no problem supporting his artistic endeavors with daily action. The result includes more letters than he can count from children, teens, and adults giving veganism a go, thanks to his influence. Currently working on a screenplay based on his novel Teacher’s Dead, he plans to take “a quiet year” touring his poetry around China, Egypt, and Lebanon. If one thing is clear, Zephaniah is more than “just a poet.” He’s a voice for those without, and a worldwide inspiration, living out his two core tenets: honesty and compassion. Year went vegan: 1971
Favorite poet: Percy Bysshe Shelley
Favorite book: Book of Nonsense by Mervyn Peake
Personal heroes: Bob Marley, Maya Angelou, Noam Chomsky
Artistic philosophy: Be honest. Don’t just go with the crowd. Check out VN’s January+February issue to learn about more vegan authors, comics, and essayists. "

"VEGAN SPORTS GEAR FOR BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL, AND MORE",https://vegnews.com/2010/4/vegan-sports-gear-for-basketball-football-and-more,"APRIL 18, 2010","While scattered showers have tried to dampen warm weather exuberance, springtime has undeniably arrived, and with it, a call to return to the great outdoors for a dose of healthy competition. Kids flood outside to participate in extracurricular activities in the warm sunshine, and adult leagues swing back into action, capitalizing on the longer daylight hours. Even traditional fall and winter sports, like football, soccer, and basketball, get revived without oppressive winter weather weighing down players’ spirits. Before you get caught up in the excitement of flushed cheeks and surging adrenaline, make your sport of choice cruelty-free by replacing sporting goods with vegan alternatives. Baseball
For avid baseball fans, springtime means one thing: the return to the dugout. By switching to vegan alternatives, ball players don’t have to worry about their performance suffering in the outfield. Major League players such as Roger Clemens, Chris Carpenter, and Johan Santana all made the switch to synthetic baseball mitts. In the past, vinyl was used in place of leather, but today’s vegan gloves are made using synthetic leather microfibers that result in stronger and lighter gloves. Carpenter Trade Company specializes in high quality, customizable vegan gloves, with the option of all-synthetic wool instead of wool felt for padding. Its gloves outperform leather competitors and tend to last longer, so the durability of your mitt is last thing you’ll have to worry about when catching a pop-up. Basketball
Basketball season is wrapping up, but that doesn’t mean you can’t cheer for cruelty-free change. The college teams you were clapping and yelling for during NCAA March Madness all began using animal-free basketballs back in 2003, and the NBA gave up leather in 2006. So what are you waiting for? Follow suit by bringing a rubber—not leather—ball to the court, which has the added advantage of reducing slippage caused by sweat. Fair Trade Sports produces an eco- and fair trade-certified rubber ball that also boasts an all-weather, high-grip surface. Football, Soccer, & Rugby
The saying may be “throw around the ol’ pigskin,” but animals don’t need to suffer for a game of touch football. The same goes for sports like soccer and rugby, where animal products have traditionally been used. Fair Trade Sports also sells vegan footballs and rugby balls, as well as several different varieties of animal-free soccer balls. As an added bonus, the company emphasizes reduced environmental impact and sustainable practices. In addition, products are made by adult workers, who are guaranteed a certified Fair-Trade wage and healthy working conditions. The result is eco-friendly equipment that no animal—or human—had to suffer to produce. Dance
Even indoor sports like dance can benefit from a vegan makeover.

EAT VEG AND LOCAL WITH CSAS,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/eat-veg-and-local-with-csas,"APRIL 18, 2010","Earth Day challenges us to reflect on natural resources, our carbon footprints, and environmental integrity. These considerations inevitably raise the question about food security—the availability and accessibility of food—and food justice—the notion that communities have the right to cultivate, sell, and consume healthy food. Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) organizations attempt to address these issues through alternative food-distribution systems. The Basics
CSA members purchase a “share” of small-plot family farms located within their neighborhood, and in return, receive a regular allotment of the week’s harvest—it’s either delivered in a box to their doorstep or available for pickup at a central location, such as farmers’ markets. Depending on the farm, “shares” might be gained through monetary exchange, a labor contract, or a combination of both. In the US, the annual average CSA “share” costs between $500 and $800, according to The New York Times. Alternately, many CSA farmers offer work-trade options, allowing members with fewer financial resources to earn their keep by visiting the farm to till, plant, water, fertilize, and harvest. More often, members opt to pay and farm. CSAs operate under the premise that the investment and risks of farming should be shared among the beneficiaries of the crop yield. A customer’s payment provides farmers with the capital to cover the annual costs of maintaining a farm. When customers pay in full at the beginning of the season, farmers have more resources to invest in the land, which translates to a more productive, healthier annual harvest. Traditionally, small-plot farmers are doomed if inclement weather or infestation ruins the crops; however, when a CSA community shares financial responsibility for food cultivation, farmers have economic security—everybody bears the burden of a bad crop by not getting as much food that harvest. Eating with the seasons means being at the whims of nature, which is part of the bargain when investing in a CSA. The Details
According to The New York Times, the CSA system first developed in Europe and Asia as a progressive means of reviving small-scale farming—a practice that has become cost-prohibitive in the modern mega-farm era of food production. During the past 20 years, CSAs have become a popular alternative to an unsustainable agriculture system. Academic experts following the phenomenon say that fewer than 100 CSAs existed in the US in the early 90s. Today, Local Harvest, a comprehensive grassroots directory of CSAs, reports more than 2,500 in its database. What’s more, the individual farms themselves are expanding through increased membership. The movement allows consumers to buy and spend locally, while minimizing the environmental degradation and high costs that accompany the storage and shipment of goods grown outside of one’s region. Bill Duesing, a national leader of organic small farm organizing, says that shipping makes up 80 percent of the cost of food. Through CSAs, farmers and consumers are given a unique opportunity to connect with one another as like-minded people joined by a common cause. People discover new connections between habitat, annual seasons, land, and food production. Many CSA members learn to emulate the work of their ancestors by canning, pickling, and even freezing foods to preserve for the scant produce available during the winter months. Earth Day is a chance to reconsider our culture’s food-production paradigm—and to do something positive to address its systemic problems. "

VEGAN EARTH DAY EVENTS TO ATTEND AND ENJOY,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/vegan-earth-day-events-to-attend-and-enjoy,"APRIL 18, 2010","The celebration of Earth Day calls for global citizens to consciously acknowledge their actions’ impact on the planet—a now-daily occurrence for many, thanks to the eco-conscious surge in society. The planet’s health is at the forefront of peoples’ minds, prompting compassionate activists everywhere to share their top, not-so-secret, “green” move: going veg. Despite campaigns that push meat and dairy as necessities, the science speaks for itself—animal agriculture is the leading contributor of greenhouse-gas emissions.

Helping promote greener eating across the US is Gene Baur, co-founder and president of Farm Sanctuary, the nation’s leading farmed-animal protection organization. Baur’s latest project, the Green Foods Campaign, gives participants the tools necessary to reach out to their local governments and communities in hopes of passing eco- and animal-friendly resolutions. “When compared with the difference you can make by simply eliminating or reducing meat and animal products from your diet, other aspects of green living pale in comparison,” says Baur.

In October 2009, Signal Mountain, Tenn., became the first town in the country to pass a Green Foods Resolution, lead in part by local activist David Cook. “I think it is part of many things that are moving in the right direction, including community-supported agriculture, organic farming, a greater commitment to vegetarianism, more car-pooling, [and] more questioning. It’s all tied together,” says Cook.

The Green Foods Campaign has since spread throughout the US; Alexandria, Va., passed a resolution in March, and many are pending across New York City. “Modern farming is concentrated, unjust, unsustainable, and depletes scarce natural resources. Veganic farming—no animal by-products or inputs, including manure—is developing and has the potential to revolutionize our food systems,” says Baur.

Despite scientific evidence pointing the finger at modern farming’s environmental impact, the debate rages on between farmers and activists. Howard Lyman, a former cattle rancher who embraced veganism more than 25 years ago, speaks with authority on the subject, having been on both sides of the fence. “The older I get, the more effective my lifestyle speaks about my choices,” says Lyman. Lyman’s background plus his support of a plant-based diet, organic farming, and hands-on food production makes him the perfect candidate to discuss meat’s environmental impact—especially with the opposition.

In an upcoming and highly anticipated debate, Lyman will tackle the question, “Can you be a good environmentalist and still eat meat?” While Lyman and fellow veg activists will answer with a resounding, “no,” Nicolette Niman plans to argue the counterpoint. Formerly of Niman Ranch, which farms and promotes free-range, “humane meat,” Niman disagrees that foregoing meat has a greater environmental impact, despite her own vegetarianism. Lyman isn’t swayed by the humane-meat argument, saying it’s “a section of production [that is] one-tenth of one percent, which is of no impact to our future. This argument will always be touted by the meat-eaters; I hope to shed some light on the truth.”  

Both Baur and Lyman are working for a greener, meat-free planet and believe change is on the horizon. “People are social creatures,” says Baur, “and we tend to do what those around us do. As there are more vegans circulating in the world, we’ll see more people coming to understand and adopt this lifestyle.” Lyman puts it more succinctly—“The future of our children and grandchildren depends on the choices we make today.”

4 STRESS-BUSTERS TO KEEP TAX SEASON FROM GETTING THE BEST OF YOU,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/4-stress-busters-to-keep-tax-season-from-getting-the-best-of-you,"APRIL 11, 2010","In the eyes of many Americans, April 15 is the equivalent of Doomsday. The dreaded tax due date means swimming through reams of paperwork and reducing one’s life to a series of itemized numbers. Once it’s all said and done, taxpayers are often spent—spiritually, emotionally, and mathematically (so many numbers!). Fret not. Herbivorous healing, decompression, and mood-boosters are at your fingertips. Fantastic Fruit
Colorful, luscious fruit is the perfect stress-eating antidote. It provides the palate with a much-deserved natural sugar high. Fruits are packed with fiber, potassium, and vitamins A and C, helping protect you from illness. Combat the headache caused by staring at tax forms in front of computer by setting out for a sunny stroll or vigorous bike ride to your nearest farmers’ market, grocer, or urban garden. Nothing is more fun than weighing down your tote bag with a hefty treasure trove of fresh, seasonal, juicy treats. For a fruit-filled boost, try a novel Ambrosia Salad, Minty Yogurt Fruit Salad, or Tofu Cream Sauce Fruit Salad. Now, go ahead and gorge on this guilt-free smorgasbord! Fitness Fiend
It’s a given that tax season causes stress, which takes a toll on your health in a big way. Looking to avoid fatigue, headaches, high blood pressure, and backaches? Successfully addressing stress is as easy as indulging in a heart-pumping, mood-boosting, endorphin-rushing 30-minute workout. Exercise not only promotes health, but also increases confidence, sustains energy levels, and ramps up the libido—and, despite what marketers would have you believe, it’s absolutely 100-percent free. Practice yoga or Pilates in your bedroom, or hit the ground running or walking. Take to the outdoors and stimulate your chi with a session of Qigong, a moving meditation, or Tai Chi, a gentle martial art. You’ll not only melt away the tension from tax day, but also extra calories. Forever Young
To let loose, sometimes you just want to party like a college freshman—consequences, like the inevitable hangover, be damned. So long as it isn’t a lifestyle, it’s ok to live and let live—just be sure that your libations are vegan drinks. Keep it chic with vegan wines, such as Four Chimneys Organic Wines, Hip Chicks Do Wine, or Yellowtail reds. Go no-holds-barred with saucy sippers, such as Smirnoff vodka, Jack Daniel’s whiskey, Seagram’s gin, or Malibu rum. Let the sin begin with more ease than ever before by downloading Barnivore’s iPhone app—it provides a handy, comprehensive list of veg-friendly beverages. The Big Finish
Tax season is over! No matter your tax-day remedy of choice, be sure to find time for family and friends—socializing and laughing with other people is one of the single-most important things that you can do for your health. It produces serotonin, endorphins, and oxytocin, leaving you with good feelings all over. "

THE STORY BEHIND THE MEAT-FREE MONDAY MOVEMENT,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/the-story-behind-the-meat-free-monday-movement,"APRIL 11, 2010","On Tuesday, April 6, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted in favor of a resolution observing Mondays as Vegetarian Day, which encourages local restaurants, grocery stores, and schools to offer a greater variety of meat-free options. The landmark resolution makes San Francisco, Calif., the first US city to officially pass a motion promoting a plant-based diet and reducing consumption of meat one day per week. City Supervisor Sophie Maxwell, a vegetarian, presented the resolution on behalf of local activists, and the board voted unanimously to pass it. The resolution states that making more meat-free alternatives available will not only improve the health of Bay Area residents, but it will also help save the planet. The initiative began as a grassroots campaign led by the San Francisco Vegetarian Society (SFVS) and animal-rights group In Defense of Animals (IDA). For SFVS President Dixie Mahy, the historic decision by the city council marks the beginning of a much bigger vegetarian revolution. “I would have never believed more than 52 years ago when I was struggling to be a vegetarian that someday I would see the Board of Supervisors pass a Veg Day resolution. I have been promoting a vegetarian and vegan diet diligently through the SFVS for 41 of its 42 years and I have to say this is definitely a milestone,” says Mahy. In an effort to see that the heart of the resolution is carried out, SFVS will be doling out vegan recipe suggestions and dietary information to restaurants and schools citywide. In addition to its work in San Francisco, the group will also be working with vegetarian activists and organizations in Oakland, Calif., and beyond to help strategize Vegetarian Day plans for other city councils. “I am hoping other groups will be encouraged to use it as a template to adopt a similar resolution in their cities,” says Mahy. While San Francisco leads the way with its citywide resolution, several other cities across the country are setting plant-based precedents in their communities and school cafeterias. In April 2009, Takoma Park, MD, declared a proclamation designating April 24 to 30 as Takoma Park Veg Week to inspire locals to eat more vegetarian-friendly meals. Last October, Baltimore City Public Schools in Baltimore, MD, banished meat from its Monday lunch menus. The change affected more than 80,000 students and made the district the first school system in America to adopt Meat-Free Mondays. School officials report that the program has made Mondays the most popular lunch day of the week, and that preparing vegetarian meals benefits its budget, as cruelty-free cooking costs 20 cents less per meal than using meat. In February, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer presented a report to the New York City Department of Education urging its members to implement a similar program in the city’s public schools. The push to eliminate meat one day per week is rapidly picking up pace in America, but the movement first got its start across the pond. In May 2009, Ghent, Belgium, became the first city in the world to declare a weekly Veggie Day to curb rising obesity rates and reduce its impact on global warming, and in June, musician and longtime vegetarian Sir Paul McCartney picked up the cause in the UK. Soon after, Israel announced that it would also be jumping on the meat-free bandwagon, making it the first country to officially adopt vegetarianism one day per week. In March 2010, Israel’s Tel Aviv University joined other international colleges such as Oxford, Columbia, and the University of California, Los Angeles, by bringing Meat-Free Mondays to its campus. "

5 CRUELTY-FREE SPRING DIY PROJECTS,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/5-cruelty-free-spring-diy-projects,"APRIL 4, 2010","When April showers drive you indoors, use the domestic downtime to dust off your DIY handbook—crafty vegans can always find a way to banish the bad-weather blues. Whether you’re into knitting needles or pickling, this month is the perfect time to roll up your sleeves, tie back your hair in a kerchief, and dig into some old-school arts and crafts. Perfect Pickling
Pickled vegetables are a universal favorite—the Japanese are renowned for their pickled ginger, Germans pile on the sauerkraut, and Koreans get all of the credit for spicy Kimchi. Perhaps the most-beloved pickled vegetable is the cucumber, whose historical references span everywhere from India and Egypt to Greece and Russia. In the US, the sour, green pickle completes children’s lunch boxes, chases a shot of top-shelf vodka, and makes a perfect companion for a monster vegan hoagie filled with Yves deli-style cold cuts and vegan cheese. Save money by making pickles from scratch. It’s a cinch, and the pickling technique can apply to a host of vegetables—think green tomatoes, beets, and asparagus. Simple recipes combine herbs, spices, salt, vinegar, and water for perfect pickles. Experiment with different varieties, such as kosher dill, bread ‘n’ butter, sour, and sweet. Bring Spring Inside
The age-old folk saying, “April showers bring May flowers,” isn’t a hard-and-fast rule. Despite the downpour outside, bring the bulb-to-bud-to-bloom indoors. “Forcing bulbs” is a horticultural technique that stimulates the rapid growth of a flower. Don’t long for your May favorites—tulips, hyacinths, and daffodils—because they can be an April reality. The tools are minimal: flower bulbs, stones or pottery shards, and clear, deep flowerpots or vases. The work is even easier: Fill the container with stones, nestle the bulb on top of the stones, and finally pour water in the container until it just licks the bottom of the bulb. Over the next few days—and here’s where the clear flowerpot is a boon—watch the plant’s roots unfurl. Festival of (Soy) Lights
Candlelight enhances ambience and creates a soft, warm environment, which is particularly welcome when storms rage. Fashioned from soybean oil, plant-based soy wax candles not only spare the bees, but also burn longer than traditional candles—without releasing chemicals and soot into your home. There’s no need to shell out big bucks on boutique candles, because creating your own container candles is a snap. First, round up your used glass jars, coffee mugs, and water glasses. Bulk soy wax is often sold in flakes, which can be purchased, along with candlewicks, from online suppliers. Select pleasing essential oils—such as lemon, peppermint, and jasmine—to scent your candles. Using a double boiler, melt the soy-wax flakes and add the essential oils. Cut the wick, leaving it two inches longer than the lip of the container. Holding the wick in place, fill the container with wax. Refrigerate, and let there be light! It Ain’t Over Yet
The attack of the domestic arts doesn’t have to stop there. Write and illustrate a comic about why it’s cool to be vegan, knit your kid sister a sweater using cotton or acrylic yarn, craft intricate origami animals, bake kale chips, practice an instrument, or host a cozy indoor picnic—just the thing to bring together pickles, daffodils, and soy candles on a rainy spring afternoon.

BLOOD IN CIGARETTES,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/blood-in-cigarettes,"APRIL 4, 2010","University of Sydney professor Simon Chapman recently highlighted research that found pigs’ blood may be an undisclosed ingredient in cigarettes. Findings were originally reported in a Dutch study on industrial uses of pigs, which included pig haemoglobin in cigarette filters. Determining which companies do and do not use animal products in their cigarettes is difficult, because the tobacco industry is not required to list its ingredients, citing trade secrets. While some cigarette companies give the illusion of transparency by voluntarily listing ingredients on their websites, any products that are “not significantly present in and do not functionally affect the finished product” can be included under the broad term “processing aids.” "
MOBY TALKS GRISTLE,https://vegnews.com/2010/4/moby-talks-gristle,"APRIL 4, 2010","Multiplatinum musician Moby is known around the world for his unique brand of urban dance music and his experimental, cinematic music videos. He has been nominated for six Grammys, and his album Play was named one of the greatest albums of all time by Rolling Stone Magazine. He frequently updates his highly trafficked blog with thoughts on America’s political landscape, quirky cartoons, and news about his work and busy life in New York City. A longtime vegan and activist, his most recent project, co-editing an anthology about food politics, allowed him to combine his love of animals with his passion for writing. Released on March 2, Gristle: From Factory Farms to Food Safety, co-edited with animal activist Miyun Park, explores the consequences that eating meat and dairy products have on health, the environment, and the animals. Moby penned the book’s introduction, and a diverse collection of public figures contributed short stories, including vegan athlete Brendan Brazier, Humane Society of the United States President Wayne Pacelle, and Niman Ranch Manager Paul Willis. VN recently caught up with Moby, currently in the midst of a cross-country book tour, to talk with him about writing, compassionate living, and factory farming. VegNews: What was the most exciting part of editing Gristle?
Moby: What’s exciting is drawing more attention to the awful things that happen at factory farms, as well as the broader ramifications of factory farming. Factory farming is a horrifying practice, destroying everything it touches, including animals, communities, workers, and then the people who eat the meat. VN: You’ve been vegan for more than 20 years. Have you noticed a significant shift in how veganism is perceived?
Moby: Veganism used to be weird and underground, and now it’s surprisingly mainstream, at least in the big cities in the US. Twenty years ago no one knew what “vegan” meant, now almost everyone does. VN: Gristle approaches food justice and animal-rights issues in a non-threatening, non-judgmental way. What has been your experience when taking this more accepting approach to outreach?
Moby: I find that people are much more receptive when they’re not being screamed at. I used to be very didactic, screaming at people and yelling that they had to agree with me and become vegan. All that happened was that people stopped listening. By being more respectful and less didactic I find it’s easier to get people to listen to the facts about animal production. VN: Food-safety and health issues surrounding meat consumption are popping up more and more in mainstream news. What do you think readers who aren’t familiar with veganism will learn from the book?
Moby: It’s hard to say, as everyone who reads Gristle seems to get something different from it. Some people respond to the animal-welfare aspects, others the environmental, and others the health. VN: Your latest album, Wait For Me, was released in 2009. Are you currently working on any new music projects?
Moby: Well, there’s a remixed version of Wait For Me coming out in 2010, then hopefully a new record next year, although I have no idea what it will sound like. Five lucky readers will take hom their own copy of Gristle—enter to win today! "

Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion house’s head designer, assured attendees backstage that all of the fur used was faux, calling it “the chicest kind of fake.” Lagerfeld also explained that his icy runway set, which included ice arches and imported icebergs, was his way of using fashion to comment on global warming.

The veggie dogs previously sold at Citi Field were vegetarian, but not vegan. Aside from the two new vegan additions, Mets fans can also still indulge in cruelty-free concessions such as soft pretzels, knishes, veggie sushi, and vegetarian sandwiches. More and more ballparks across the country are hearing the call for veg-friendly options, including Citizens Bank Park, the stadium that the Philadelphia Phillies call home. Citizens Bank Park, which is currently holding a contest to rename its signature hot dog, sells vegan-friendly franks with unusual plant-based toppings, such as broccoli rabe and spicy roasted peppers.

According to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), Ito En is Japan’s first major consumer-products manufacturer to eliminate unnecessary testing on animals.

ATTEND SXSW FROM YOUR LAPTOP,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/attend-sxsw-from-your-laptop,"MARCH 21, 2010","The music biz’s most important yearly get-together, South by Southwest (SXSW), kicked off last Wednesday when more than 1,800 bands descended upon Austin, Texas, for an event like no other. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to spare the $750 required for SXSW entry badges, let alone the airfare. Luckily, cruelty-free fun doesn’t have to break the bank. If you can’t go to a real music festival, why not bust out your iPod and rock out to a playlist of the most awesome veg musicians? All hail, Joan Jett! The woman who put the grrr in grrrl exploded onto the music scene in the late ‘70s, throwing down “I Love Rock ‘n’ Roll” and “Bad Reputation,” now staples in the rock ‘n’ roll cannon. Vegetarian for more than 20 years, not to mention one rebellious, ribald lady, this renegade songstress paved the road for chicks with big ideas and big voices. Put another dime in the jukebox, baby. Known for her signature turbans, Erykah Badu wears many hats, including high-art intellectual, political chanteuse, and “Queen of Neo-Soul.” She navigates jazz, hip hop, and R&B effortlessly; inspires masses with her eccentric brand of cool; and continues to rack up Grammys (to date, she’s won four). Badu exposes admirers to animal-welfare, peace and conflict, class, and race issues. In 2008, the Dallas-based artist talked to VegNews about living with intention: “Vegan food is soul food in its purest form.” Cedric Bixler-Zavala, former frontman of prog-rock hardcore band At the Drive-In and frontman of The Mars Volta, explores uncharted sonicscapes, challenging listeners’ ears with complex, razor-sharp sounds. The dreamy, green-eyed Mexican-American from El Paso, Texas, rocks audiences with his explosive vocals and high-energy stage presence (we’re talking scaling walls and flipping out in front of thousands of screaming fans). And it’s Bixler-Zavala’s plant-packed diet that lends a powerful punch to his performance repertoire. Hip-hop artist Saul Williams is as much a poet as a social-justice activist. The title of his latest album, The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust!, a radical David Bowie Ziggy Stardust tribute, is a case-in-point. His music is cerebral and literary, and he has collaborated and toured with fellow vegans Erykah Badu and Cedric Bixler-Zavala. Williams is a cultural critic, powerful lyricist, talented writer (penning articles for the New York Times, Esquire, and African Voices), and a proud vegan. The list of conscientious music greats goes on and on: Leona Lewis (solo soul singer), Ted Leo (Ted Leo & the Pharmacists), Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders), Nellie McKay (singer/songwriter), Morrissey (The Smiths), and Moby (solo artist) all make the grade. And if you’re going for something a little out of the ordinary, bop your head to the beat of funnyman Weird Al Yankovic. Who cares if he’s a little crazy? He’s vegan! "

Researchers discovered that 76 percent of chicken slaughtered in the EU contained campylobacter and another 14 percent tested positive for salmonella. While findings varied widely across Europe, most nations tested positive for some level of bacteria in the chicken. Research also indicates that the majority of chickens were infected while still alive, with further contamination occurring during the slaughtering process. "

Key provisions of the plan include more plant-based meal options, healthier milk alternatives, and incentives for schools to offer vegetarian options. To test its feasibility, the act suggests beginning with a two-year pilot study, funded by the US Department of Agriculture.

SCIENTISTS CONDEMN WHALING,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/scientists-condemn-whaling,"MARCH 18, 2010","New research has proven that whales can be studied without being killed, disproving the Japanese government’s claim that living whales cannot be properly studied in their natural habitats. Scientists from Australia and New Zealand reached this conclusion after completing the first of five expeditions planned to assess whether or not nonlethal whale research is as effective as lethal methods. Researchers were able to thoroughly study whale eating, living, and migration patterns, and deduced that Japanese whalers do not need to kill whales in order to conduct accurate scientific research. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd previously took a harsh stance on Japanese whaling, and supported the research team in a public statement last December. "

"4 GREEN, ECO-FRIENDLY SPRING GETAWAYS",https://vegnews.com/2010/3/4-green-eco-friendly-spring-getaways,"MARCH 14, 2010","In our March+April issue, VN shares the very best of green living, including an investigation into the environmental impact of eco-tourism. Now that you’re armed with the know-how to leave a lighter carbon footprint, consider traveling to one of these four green global hotspots for an eco-friendly spring break getaway. 1. Amsterdam
Cars, trucks, and buses are conspicuously absent in Amsterdam, because in this Dutch city the bicycle rules. A staggering 25 percent of Amsterdam residents always commute by bike on 250 miles of bike paths. About $31 million a year is spent for cycling infrastructure, some of it allocated to new parking garages for thousands of bicycles. Meanwhile, car parking in the city has been reduced by more than half, and speed limits have been lowered in many places to 18 mph. If a car is needed, there is a “car dating service” called Greenwheels that lets locals share community cars for a small monthly fee. Living in a small country with such a dense population has taught the Dutch to be expert recyclers. A number of programs surpass the usual recycling systems to include clothing, and shoes and chemical waste. To deter unnecessary consumerism, if residents buy a new electrical appliance, they are dinged with a fee to remove the old one. 2. Chicago
Mayor Richard Daley is ambitious, powerful, competitive, and, lucky for Chicagoans, pretty green. He wants Chicago to be known as the greenest city in America, and seems unstoppable when it comes to planting trees-half a million in 2006-to beautify the city and provide much-needed oxygen and shade. He’s on a roll with greening city rooftops (3 million square feet) to conserve energy, filter rainwater, and buffer intense summertime heat. Daley’s Environmental Action Agenda replaced more than 100 city vehicles with hybrids and installed more than 12,000 bike racks around the city, as cycling has become one of the most common methods of transportation, along with Chicago’s well-traveled transit system. 3. Curitiba
Author of Urban Acupuncture and perhaps the world’s most advanced practitioner of green city design, architect and former mayor of Curitiba, Jaime Lerner, transformed his city in southern Brazil over three decades into what is now hailed as “one of the greenest cities in the world.” With the population exploding and pollution on the rise, Lerner built parks and created lakes to ease flooding and closed the main street to traffic, turning it into a pedestrian-only plaza. Curitiba is now defined by its cobbled squares where people mingle and stroll with barely a car in sight. Entire roads, highways, and lanes have been allocated exclusively for buses to increase efficiency, and an affordable flat-rate fee was put into effect so that poorer people living in outlying areas could get around. The system is so efficient that even those who can afford to drive prefer to take public transit. 4. Singapore
This densely populated island city-state in Southeast Asia was early to the table on environmental policy and has since become a global inspiration. Singapore’s Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, established in 1972, aimed to achieve environmental sustainability for the long term. Proposals for radical new policies include having cars fitted with satellite tracking meters and charging drivers a per-mile fee to reduce traffic and encourage use of the city’s transit system. The Singapore Building and Construction Authority launched a Green Mark Scheme in 2005 similar to the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Rating System in the US. Known now as the “Garden City of the East” after four decades of greening, the city gets 20 to 30 percent of its water supply from rainwater. In 1963, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew launched a Tree Planting Campaign in Singapore, sparking a tropical oasis that includes extensive parkland, natural wildlife habitat, shaded roadways, and garden rooftops.

MEET 4 HAPPY RESCUES FROM CATSKILL ANIMAL SANCTUARY,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/meet-4-happy-rescues-from-catskill-animal-sanctuary,"MARCH 14, 2010","Rambo the Ram, Barbie the Hen, Malachi the Goat, and Charlie the Pig have found companionship through New York State’s Catskill Animal Sanctuary (CAS), an 80-acre haven for animals rescued from neglect, abuse, and abandonment. Since its inception nine years ago, CAS has served 1,500 animals by providing loving care and transitioning the rehabilitated critters to new, happy homes. VN chatted with CAS Founder and Director Kathy Stevens, author of the forthcoming Animal Camp: My Summer with a Horse, a Pig, a Cow, and Pigeon, a Dog, Two Cats, and One Very Patient Man, to share four special farm animals. Rambo the Ram
Rambo, pictured above, arrived at CAS in 2002 after being saved—along with 14 other animals—from a locked stall on an abandoned property, where the owner would drop by a couple times a week and throw stale bagels to the animals. Rambo arrived at CAS full of violence and mistrust, even using his massive horns to pin his human caretakers against the barn wall. Now he’s a natural leader among the animals, one whom Stevens calls a “teacher, sage, healer, and peacemaker.” He even has a fan club comprised of two hens and a turkey.
Favorite food: Ginger snaps
Best friend: His paramour, Hannah the sheep
Favorite thing: Massages on his rear quarters Charlie the Pig
Charlie’s caretaker relocated to Europe. Over the course of her 6,000-mile trans-Atlantic flight to her new neighborhood, she must have had a change of heart—once her plane landed, she called CAS in tears, upset that she had “forgotten” to find a home for three sheep and one Charlie. He came to CAS dehydrated and depressed, a condition that didn’t begin to lift until a year later, when he found a friend in Rambo the Ram. Stevens says that these days, Charlie happily spends his time stealing hay to pad his already very generous bedding and sneaking mixed grains from the horses’ breakfast bowls.
Favorite food: Horse feed
Best friend: His snuggle-buddy, Ozzie the pig
Favorite thing: Stealing hay Barbie the Hen
Barbie, pictured above with Rambo, is a broiler hen from Brooklyn, where she was found cowering under a parked car. When she arrived at CAS two years ago, Barbie quickly adapted to her new, free-range lifestyle. Stevens explains that broiler hens are bred to grow huge, suffering from the same health problems as morbidly obese humans, so the friendly folks at CAS keep a close watch on her diet. Usually, Barbie can be found snuggling with Rambo the Ram, whom she adores.
Favorite food: Bananas
Best friend: Rambo
Favorite thing: Chillin’ with fowl friends Malachi the Goat
When Malachi’s horse friend passed away, his grief was so profound that his guardians brought him to CAS, where they hoped he would find solace in a new animal companion. At CAS, Malachi had his pick of two large pastures of goats, but he instead ended up befriending Passion, a timid horse, who helps remind Malachi of his lost beloved. Goats are notorious for eating anything they can get their hands—er, teeth—on, and Malachi is no exception. Because of his predisposition to graze, caretakers limit his diet to hay and small quantities of grain and vegetable.
Favorite food: Fruit treats

CONFINEMENT ACT,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/confinement-act,"MARCH 14, 2010","Last week, US House Representatives Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., and Diane Watson, D-Calif., introduced the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, which would require that food purchased for federal programs come from farmed animals raised with adequate room to stretch their limbs, turn around, lie down, and stand up. The federal government purchases more than $1 billion worth of dairy, egg, and meat products for programs like the Bureau of Prisons, the National School Lunch Program, and the Armed Services. The bill has been referred to the House of Agriculture Committee and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In 2008, California passed a bill by the same name, which will phase out confinement of hens in battery cages, pigs in gestation crates, and calves in veal crates by 2015. "
VEGAN RIGHTS,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/vegan-rights,"MARCH 14, 2010","Vegans now receive workplace discrimination protection under UK law, due to a recently released code of practice explaining the legal implications of a 2009 equality bill. The code, drafted by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, clarifies that in order to receive protection, beliefs do not need to include faith or worship of god/gods. It specifically mentions vegans, and explains that they warrant protection because the “ethical commitment to animal welfare” is central to who they are. Codes of practice are used to provide guidance about how to enforce legislation—in this case, the equality bill backed by Equalities Minister Harriet Harman. "
INTERVIEW WITH WORLD’S LITTLEST BRAT’S VEGAN DIRECTOR KATHY KOLLA,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/interview-with-worlds-littlest-brats-vegan-director-kathy-kolla,"MARCH 14, 2010","For screenwriter and director Kathy Kolla, veganism is a laughing matter. Her first feature-length film, World’s Littlest Brat, takes a comedic approach to the trials and tribulations of growing up vegan, by focusing on a lovable vegan outcast living in a less than understanding world. A vegan for over 10 years, Kolla also looked for ways to make the film as eco-friendly as possible, through green living practices and partnerships with companies like Millennium Products, Glacia IceBox, and Amy’s Kitchen. Before making the circuits at film festivals, Kolla took time to talk with VegNews about the film, her production company, and being a successful and thriving vegan in the Hollywood scene for over a decade. VegNews: The movie that you’re working on focuses on a vegan character who has to stay true to his ideals despite his non-vegan surroundings. Is this a topic you’ve had experience with first hand?
Kathy Kolla: Yes, definitely, but I also believe that everyone at some point in their lives has an experience where they’ve needed to stay true to themselves in some sort of situation, and I feel vegans perhaps to a greater extent. You just have to believe in what you’re doing and believe that’s the best thing for you. I’ve always stood up for my own beliefs instead of following other people, and I find in some situations other people started to follow me and it’s a great feeling. I always try to lead by example and a lot of people see that I’m living a great, healthy lifestyle and they’ll want to follow me. VN: What advice would you give to filmmakers looking to reduce their impact?
KK: Start off small. There really are enormous amounts of things you can do, basic things like turning off lights when they’re not in use, walking instead of taking cars and motorcycles, bringing your own bags and boxes to the grocery store instead of taking theirs. Also, looking into renewable energy. VN: What are some of the ways your production company, Cola Kat, is reducing the environmental impact of the movie?
KK: What we’re doing is photocopying double-sided so we don’t waste paper, and we’re only giving copies of scripts to people that really need them instead of handing them out to everyone. We’re really trying to keep everything to a minimum, trying to watch what is being thrown away, and trying to reduce and reuse instead of throwing everything in the trash. VN: How did companies like Amy’s Kitchen and Millennium Products become involved in the movie?
KK: I wrote those products into the script just because I’m a fan of the foods, and I thought it would be helpful in emphasizing the vegan lifestyle of the main character. We just contacted them about showcasing their products and they were more than willing to help. In fact, G.T. Dave, the founder of Millennium Products and G.T.’s Kombucha, is going to do a cameo in our film. I’m really excited about that. Another great supporter is Glacia IceBox. They donated a lot of product to us. VN: How has the vegan community changed in the past 10 years, especially in regards to the Hollywood scene?
KK: Well I think that veganism is much more accepted now than it was probably ten years ago. I think that people are more concerned about what they’re eating. They’re focusing on local, organic food. The more that people are educated, the more they are going to start following it. VN: What are your plans for the future, both with the production company Cola Kat and as a filmmaker, writer, and director?
KK: For me, by far, I enjoy being a director. I mean the entire process of making a film is so rewarding—to come up with an idea, to see it come to fruition, it’s such a great feeling of accomplishment. Just running an eco-friendly company and leading by example and to know that we’re sending out a positive message is something I would love to continue doing. Photo by Luca Escriva "

USDA VETERINARIAN SPEAKS OUT,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/usda-veterinarian-speaks-out,"MARCH 13, 2010","Last Thursday, Dean Wyatt, a supervisory veterinarian for the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), testified to Congress that government officials refused to act on his reports of illegal slaughterhouse practices. Wyatt claims that FSIS management violated food safety and humane slaughter laws by ignoring serious infractions, such as shocking and killing downer calves and conscious pigs. Wyatt also testified that when he questioned superiors about these issues, he was threatened with transfer or demotion. In 2008 and early 2009, negligence reports that Wyatt filed against Bushway Packing Inc., went unaddressed. Bushway was later shut down, after a Humane Society of the United States investigation revealed egregious animal-welfare violations. "
OBAMA ON BLUEFINS,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/obama-on-bluefins,"MARCH 12, 2010","Last week, the Obama Administration announced its support of a proposal that would ban international trade of Atlantic bluefin tuna. European city-state Monaco will present the trade ban for consideration at the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The summit will be held in Doha, Qatar, from March 13 to 15. The ban’s new US sponsorship significantly strengthens the possibility of its passage, which requires at least a two-thirds vote. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization lists the bluefin tuna as an endangered species. Commercial fishing has decreased the bluefin population by more than 80 percent since 1970. This is a result of its popularity in Japan, where the fish is considered a delicacy and 80 percent of the world’s catch is consumed.   "
FACTORY FARM PAYS UP,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/factory-farm-pays-up,"MARCH 12, 2010","On March 4, seven Gentry Farm families were awarded $11 million, after Premium Standards Farm (PSF) lost a court case regarding the stench produced by its pig factory farm. The most damaging evidence was PSF’s failure to clean up odors over the past 11 years, despite being ordered to do so by the Missouri Attorney General. The case, which was brought to court by one attorney representing all families, does not mark the first time local farmers have squared off against PSF. The factory farm lost a similar case in the 1990s, and awarded $5.2 million to the 52 families involved. PSF plans to appeal the court’s most recent verdict, claiming the jury could not sort through each individual’s claims. "

Barker, a longtime advocate of spaying and neutering companion animals, attended the press conference and ribbon cutting ceremony held on Wednesday at the Bob Barker Building on Sunset Boulevard. The new offices will house the organization’s media, marketing, youth outreach, and campaign departments. PETA President Ingrid Newkirk praised Barker for his donation, saying that he could have simply bought the group a new refrigerator, and instead chose to finance a new building. "

A vegetarian for a year and a half, Studdard made the switch to a vegan diet six months ago and has since dropped 100 pounds. The noticeably smaller singer discussed his favorite vegan foods with Williams, including a cruelty-free mac and cheese with greens.

If your activism has been hibernating this winter, stories of these pint-sized (well, some of them) powerhouses will help you shake off your slumber! Name: Hannah Kaminsky
Hometown: Fairfield, Conn.
Age: 21
Why we’re watching: There are scads of ways to make the world a better place for animals, but none more delectable than Kaminsky’s approach. Kaminsky, whose first cookbook, My Sweet Vegan, was published when she was still a teenager, is turning the world toward compassionate living one dessert at a time. “While I don’t go to rallies or demonstrations specifically for animal rights, I do introduce people to the idea that it isn’t hard to go vegan, and there are many benefits,” she says. This kitchen alchemist is known for her habit-forming treats—we’re talking super-tasty fudge, cakes, cookies, and pies—but her talents aren’t limited to the culinary sphere; she’s also a prolific photographer, popular blogger, and crafter extraordinaire. “Veganism is all about preventing cruelty to animals, so I just want to get more people baking without using animal products,” says Kaminsky. “Every little bit helps.”

Tofu or seitan: Die-hard tofu fan right here! Name: Patrick Kwan
Hometown: New York, NY
Age: 28
Why we’re watching: In his fantasy alternate universe, Kwan is a vegan restaurateur and food critic. In real life, the New York City native is a kick-ass animal advocate and blogger who has worked to improve the lives of animals since high school, when he founded the Student Animal Rights Alliance (SARA). At SARA’s helm, Kwan organized a series of popular national animal-rights conferences and trained thousands of students in the art of activism. As New York State Director for the Humane Society of the United States, he uses his well-honed skills to raise awareness about important issues ranging from canned hunts to puppy mills. Oh yeah: He’s also known for his ability to whip up gourmet vegan feasts. Besides multi-course meals, Kwan stays motivated through humor, which he finds in small things. “Especially bad haircuts, which I get all the time,” he says. With so many successes already under his belt, there’s no telling what Kwan will accomplish next, but let’s just say we think the Big Apple could definitely handle one more vegan restaurant.

Phillips’ bipartisan approach to getting the job done means he might work with Republican State Senator Frank Padavan one day, and Democratic Governor David Paterson the next. Always building alliances with grace and poise, Phillips never lets his focus lapse from the ultimate goal: bettering the lives of animals. “John is a very strong person,” says friend and colleague Daniel Elstein. “He knows that the stakes are too high to get distracted.” Any chance he’ll be pursuing politics himself? “No,” he says. “I have the best job ever.

Why we’re watching: It’s simple: before Runkle turns 30, he wants to have inspired a million people to go veg. Considering not only that by the time 2014 rolls around he will have been an activist for half of his life, and the incredible momentum his work through Mercy For Animals (MFA) generates, making a million vegetarians doesn’t seem quite so far-fetched for one person. As Runkle says, “All of history’s most famous social-justice leaders recognized just how powerful each of us truly is in changing the world.” Since founding MFA at age 15, Runkle’s been working non-stop, and plans are in the works to expand all of the group’s operations including grassroots outreach, pro-veg ad campaigns, and undercover investigations—like the one obtained at Norco Ranch, a California egg producer, which captured the horrific lives of egg-laying hens during the successful Proposition 2 campaign. Runkle’s advice for garnering media attention: “Be creative … and always speak the truth.”

VEGETARIAN AND VEGAN OSCAR NOMINEES (AND WINNERS!),https://vegnews.com/2010/3/vegetarian-and-vegan-oscar-nominees-and-winners,"MARCH 7, 2010","This year, veg actors and causes were represented at the Academy Awards, with vegan actor Woody Harrelson’s nod for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his work in The Messenger, and The Cove’s win for Best Documentary. The Cove, which has been awarded worldwide, follows a group of activists as they try to expose the dolphin slaughter that occurs in a cove in Taijii, Japan. The film beat out fellow nominee Food, Inc., which examines the corporatizing of the nation’s food supply and the industries behind factory farms.  Although the curtains have swept closed, the last golden statue has been doled out, and the tears from acceptance speeches have finally dried from this year’s ceremony, there’s no need to retire the Champagne flutes and wait another 12 months for the red carpet to unfurl. Instead of watching immobile faces spout best and worst dressed commentary, appreciate these veg actors’ performances in the roles that garnered them Academy recognition. James Cromwell: Nominated, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Babe (1995)
Cromwell removed meat from his diet in 1974, but it took his role as Farmer Hoggett in Babe to transform him into an ethical vegan. After the film, Cromwell worked with PETA to promote animal welfare, specifically to speak out against animal cruelty toward pigs. He later appeared onscreen alongside vegetarian Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential. Dustin Hoffman: Nominated, Best Actor, The Graduate (1967); Nominated, Best Actor Midnight Cowboy (1969); Nominated, Best Actor, Lenny (1974); Won, Best Actor, Kramer vs. Kramer (1979); Nominated, Best Actor, Tootsie (1982); Won, Best Actor, Rain Man (1988); Nominated, Best Actor, Wag the Dog (1997)
This vegetarian actor’s prolific career proves a plant-based lifestyle can fuel award-winning performances. Hoffman earned an Academy nod after only his second film, The Graduate, and was able to pick up six more Best Actor nominations during his career, with two wins along the way. Joaquin Phoenix: Nominated, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Gladiator (2000); Nominated, Best Actor, Walk the Line (2005)
Say what you will about erratic behavior and the announcement that he’d be retiring from Hollywood to pursue a rap career, there’s no denying that Joaquin Phoenix has been a vocal proponent for an animal-free lifestyle. He appeared in a PETA PSA against eating turkey on Thanksgiving, and refused to wear leather sandals for his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Emperor Commodus in Gladiator. Although he didn’t win a Best Actor Oscar for his turn as country crooner Johnny Cash, he lost to 2006’s only other meat-free nominee: Forest Whitaker. Kate Winslet: Nominated, Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Sense and Sensibility (1995); Nominated, Best Actress, Titanic (1997); Nominated, Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Iris (2001); Nominated, Best Actress, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004); Nominated, Best Actress, Little Children (2006); Won, Best Actress, The Reader (2008)
Although it may have taken six nominations before finally winning that golden statue, Kate Winslet’s vegetarian lifestyle must have given her the energy to continually tackle challenging roles and complex characters. Other Veg Nominees and Winners: Casey Affleck: Nominated, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)
Kim Basinger: Won, Best Actress in a Supporting Role, L.A. Confidential (1997)
Angela Bassett: Nominated, Best Actress, What’s Love Got to Do With It? (1993)

The bill provides exemptions for surgery for animals with congenital defects, disease, or injury. Medically necessary devocalization surgery would require certification from a licensed veterinarian. The procedure involves cutting vocal cords, which can result in excessive scar tissue that interferes with eating and drinking.

GREEN YOUR GARDEN,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/green-your-garden,"MARCH 7, 2010","In our March+April issue, VN reveals five easy ways to green your household—the most important of which is banishing animal products from your kitchen. Now that you’ve lowered your indoor impact, prepare for spring picnics and summer barbecues by developing a seriously eco-conscious green thumb. Yes, environmentally friendly gardening is as important to eco home remodeling as indoor renovation, a fact that Hamad Juma, owner and operator of Mazingira Gardening Services, knows all too well. Mazingira—which means “environment which encompasses ones’ local environment and the world at large” in Hamad’s native Kiswahili—is an eco-friendly lawn care service based in Berkeley, Calif. As a dedicated vegan, Hamad understands the connection between compassionate eating and sustainable living, and his business practices are a reflection of these values. While many companies reduce eco-friendly gardening to eliminating harsh chemicals, Mazingira uses cruelty-free insect control methods, natural fertilizers, zero-impact push mowers and hand tools, and animal-free soil and gardening gear—even Hamad’s work gloves are made of vegan-friendly materials. Along with wife and business assistant Ruthie Gordon, Hamad is on a mission to create landscapes that work with, not against, the environment. VegNews: Can an unsustainable lawn cause as negative an impact as a high-energy-emitting house?
Hamad Juma Hamad: Yes, if a yard is not maintained in an eco-friendly way, it has a very big impact on the environment. All of the chemicals used are very toxic and destroy soils and water systems. A lot of gardens potentially use the same resources as a house does—lighting and water systems, construction materials such as timber and concrete—things that cause problems when produced but also leech into the soil and destroy it. VN: Before founding Mazingira you worked on making physical homes more sustainable. How does your company extend home greening into backyards?
HH: I use drip irrigation, which brings water to a particular plant, saves water, and prevents run-off. Instead of using chemicals for weed control, we focus on non-toxic methods such as hand weeding, non-toxic sprays, and eco-friendly fabrics and mulch to suppress weed growth. Also, a major thing is to think about the best plants to use in a space—how it suits site conditions, if it is resistant to the pests that may already exist. Having strong, healthy, and naturally resistant plants is the key to avoiding the need for invasive and often toxic pest control methods. Pest control is a hard issue, especially for a vegan! I educated myself on various natural methods such as using beneficial insects. I also avoid using machines in my maintenance work. VN: Mazingira offers “veganic urban vegetable and herb gardening” and “eco-friendly, natural pest control.” Tell us a little about these practices.
HH: You can’t think about the environment without thinking about animal agriculture. The “veganic” in the vegetable and herb gardening offered is using vegan soils and fertilizers. But pest control of course is very challenging. When you’re vegan there’s the questions—do you kill things like aphids, slugs, and other pests? How would you explain avoiding that to a client who isn’t vegan and may just think your system is too complicated and want to look somewhere else? The good news is there are a lot of preventative things you can do to avoid the issue. You can use barrier methods such as protecting plants from slugs by laying down sandpaper or copper strips. You can remove pests by hand without killing them. Also, many pests won’t actually destroy plants if you have strong, healthy plants to begin with. You can also plant other things that cooperate with your veggies and herbs that discourage pests. Really, it’s all in the planning, which is why I studied landscape design. It’s crucial to choose the right plant for a certain site. VN: What tips and tricks would you offer someone who is passionate about lowering his or her carbon footprint but is without a great, green resource?
HH: Replace your lawn with native plants like wildflowers, which are naturally drought tolerant and low maintenance. For weed control, throw down some thick layers of cardboard and then some mulch. You can even just use dead leaves as mulch. Also, you can improve your soil’s condition by not raking up your dead leaves. Just let them decompose there and you have a great, natural fertilizer. Also use hand tools such as push mowers instead of gas-powered ones. "
SCHOOL BANS VIVISECTION PRACTICE,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/school-bans-vivisection-practice,"MARCH 6, 2010","The Michigan State University Veterinary School will eliminate the student practice of terminal surgeries of canines beginning in fall 2010. Terminal surgeries involve the anesthetization and ultimate euthanization of dogs bred specifically for the purpose of student surgical training. In 2009, the program—the only veterinarian program in the state—put to sleep approximately 140 dogs. Most of the country’s 28 veterinary schools now rely on alternative, non-lethal student-practice techniques, which involve the use of computer simulation, cadavers, and models of animals. "

Republican Senator Tim Corder drafted the bill in anticipation of rapid expansion of the state’s poultry industry, which he expects to reach 10 million chickens within six months. Since California passed the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act in 2008, making confinement of hens in battery cages a criminal offense, Idaho legislators and economic developers are offering California poultry farmers incentives to relocate to Idaho.

Butler, a lifelong meat-eater, went vegan during the month of February and chronicled his month-long foray into compassionate eating online.

FACTORY FARM BY-PRODUCTS,https://vegnews.com/2010/3/factory-farm-by-products,"MARCH 1, 2010","Yesterday, The Washington Post published an article examining the ecological harm of excess manure that results from factory farming. Due to overcrowding on the farms, animals now produce more manure than can be recycled as fertilizer. This excess manure gives off methane gas and acts as a water pollutant when it is washed to the coast, where it feeds the unnatural algae blooms that cause dead zones. Although states like Oklahoma and Florida have pushed for legislation regulating the disposal of animal by-products, laws have been met with resistance from agricultural groups looking to keep farming costs low.

The move follows two investigations, one during a European Union veterinary inspection and the other from Animal Aid, exposing poor hygiene standards and animal mistreatment in UK meat-cutting plants. While the agency cannot force plants to install the cameras, CEO Tim Smith hopes a slaughterhouse’s refusal to comply will serve as a warning that operators have something to hide, and encourage distributors to buy from plants that make their methods transparent.

VEGAN ROCKERS ALKALINE TRIO TALK,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/vegan-rockers-alkaline-trio-talk,"FEBRUARY 21, 2010","It’s no surprise that Matt Skiba, founding member and the lead singer of Alkaline Trio, is eager to talk about music and his band’s latest album, This Addiction. Yet Skiba, along with Alkaline’s drummer Derek Grant, express similar passion when ask about their vegetarianism. Not only do these lifelong punk rockers happily impart their how-I-went-veg stories, they rave about veg restaurants across the country as only touring musicians and true veg foodies can. VN caught up with the guys as they gear for the This Addiction tour to talk music, life on the road, and Seitanic Caesar Salad. VegNews: What sparked your transition to vegetarianism?
Matt Skiba: I used to eat a lot of meat when I was younger, and around the time I was nineteen, when I moved out of my parents’ house, I was eating a piece of meat and looking at my cat looking up at me. I envisioned myself eating my cat and suddenly it didn’t sound so good to me. For me it just became instinctual that meat wasn’t something I wanted in my body. It’s part of who I am. It’s personal and it’s natural to me. Derek Grant: I was pretty much raised in an entirely vegetarian household. I wasn’t aware that there was a whole community of vegetarians out there. There was a point where I said, “I want to understand the other side of this situation,” and I ate meat for maybe three years. Then right around the time that I phased meat out and became vegetarian, I recognized that I was lactose intolerant. So again, I was completely naïve to the fact that there was a thing called veganism. After a few years, I started going to a lot of hardcore shows where everybody was straight edge and vegan. That was when I found out that there were other people that were like-minded. VN: How have your friends reacted to your vegetarianism?
MS: I’ve turned friends on [to vegetarian eating] by not saying anything. There’s a place in LA called Veggie Grill, and they have locations throughout Southern California. It’s so good, and if I didn’t tell [my friends] that this “chicken” sandwich was vegetarian [they] would have never known, and it tastes fresher and better than any chicken you’ve ever had. I’ve definitely converted people without having to say anything since there’s a lot of really great food out there that speaks for itself. I think most people are animal lovers. I don’t think because you eat meat you’re a bad person or you don’t love animals. I think ignorance is bliss for a lot of people. People eat vegetarian without even knowing it, and it’s easy and delicious and healthy. VN: Alkaline Trio got its start in Chicago. Any favorite local veg hotspots?
MS: Chicago Diner is amazing. I love that place. I’ve been eating there since I can remember. Two years ago they took my favorite thing off the menu. Initially it was called the Seitanic Caesar Salad, this vegan Caesar salad that was absolutely killer. Then they changed the name of it-they have funky, fun names for a lot of dishes-and then, I don’t know why they did it, but they took it off the menu and I was so bummed about it that I went in and complained. I was nice about it and they obviously make great food aside from that salad, but I politely protested and said that they should put it back on the menu. And they did! About two weeks ago I got a phone call from a friend of mine saying that they put the Caesar back on the menu. DG: Chicago Diner, Karen’s Cooked, and Handlebar are three of my favorite restaurants in the city. VN: The band has described This Addiction as both “a step forward” while also retaining “glimmers” of the band’s past. What about this album calls back that earlier sound?
MS: With this record, and with our earlier records, we lived together and would write the record together at home and on the road, and it was something that happened a lot more organically. With This Addiction we did it that way. We did it all in the same room, when we were in sound checks, when we were on tour, when we were together doing band stuff. It was a liberating experience that lent to how it came out. It’s more like a punk rock record because we recorded it like a punk rock band. Photo courtesy of Epitaph Records. "

Last October, a group of six bloggers created a similar blog to chronicle cooking their way through Robin Robertson’s 1,000 Vegan Recipes. "

DOLLAR-A-DAY EXPERIMENT,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/dollar-a-day-experiment,"FEBRUARY 20, 2010","As a social experiment, Kerri Leonard and Christopher Greenslate, two vegan English teachers from Encinitas, Calif., challenged themselves to eat for $1 a day for a month. They alternated writing about the experience in a blog, which led to the publication of their book, On a Dollar a Day. Released last week, the book explores issues of hunger and poverty and the toll they take on health and nutrition. The idea grew from a trip to the grocery store, when the two compared their spending habits with the poverty experienced around the world. After realizing billions of people live on a dollar a day, the pair decided to live similarly for a month and chronicle their experience. "
OLIVERA EGG FARM SCANDAL,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/olivera-egg-farm-scandal,"FEBRUARY 19, 2010","Last Thursday, a federal judge found that San Jose-based Olivera Egg Farm, whose estimated annual revenue is $8 million, spoiled evidence before a scheduled environmental investigation of the site by dredging sludge from its 16.5-acre fecal and urine lagoon. The factory farm, which cages up to 700,000 laying hens, also faces six counts of operating and expanding its facilities without permits. The Humane Society of the United States encouraged state air regulators to investigate after years of complaints from local residents had been filed with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District and county Board of Health. The complaints cited the lagoon’s proximity to children’s play areas, its stench, and its noxious fumes.   "

UK IMPORTED MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/uk-imported-meat,"FEBRUARY 16, 2010","An investigation released yesterday by the Guardian found that one-quarter of the meat for sale in the UK comes from countries with less strict animal-welfare laws, including EU nations. Currently, there are no restrictions on imported meat, regardless of the weaker standards in place in the exporting nations, and imported food does not have to be labeled as such. The imported meat often costs much less for distributors than buying meat produced within the UK. In response to the investigation, consumer and agriculture groups are calling for more accurate labeling and uniform standards across the EU, such as stickers identifying the meat’s country of origin.

VEGNEWS COVER REVEALED!,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/vegnews-cover-revealed,"FEBRUARY 16, 2010","Inder Bedi of Matt & Nat, Leanne Mai-ly Hilgart of Vaute Couture, and Elizabeth Olsen of OlsenHaus were all contenders for the cover of our March+April issue, but today we are thrilled to announce that Hilgart is our cover gal! We are absolutely beside ourselves with glee about featuring this vegan busniess owner—and her adorable pup, Whitman!—on one of our most exciting issues of the year. Of course, it would have been an honor to feature any of our finalists, but sadly we only had cover space for one. Read on to see what all three finalists have to say about green business, vegan ethics, and more in this sneak preview of the exclusive VN interviews, and look for the full feature story on the eco-friendly masterminds in our new issue, which comes out next week! VegNews: What green initiatives do your businesses have in place?
Inder Bedi: Our handbag linings are made from 100-percent recycled water bottles. We are working on finding more applications for fibers that are the result of recycling water bottles, as well as other recycled fabrics.
Leanne Mai-ly Hilgart: Fabric research is the heart of Vaute Couture. The liner fabric is 100-percent recycled closed loop zero waste, which means it recycles into the same fabric without any deterioration of quality and without creating any waste. The shell fabric is made in the US and is 100-percent recyclable using Patagonia’s Common Threads Recycling Program. Of course, we do the small things too, including using sustainable businesses to print our postcards, hangtags, and a US-based sustainable screenprinter for our 100-percent-organic cotton tees.
Elizabeth Olsen: I try to hire and support other vegan professional as much as possible, so obviously anyone at the office gets soymilk and vegan food for meetings. I produce as close to the US as possible to reduce emissions. The shoeboxes are recycled, and in the office everything is via email or digital. For the product, we are working with recycled materials and continuing to develop new components. VN: Why did you decide to complement your vegan business with green ethics?
IB: I would like to think that being a vegan also means being aware of all consequences of your decisions.
LH: I believe in the whole goodness—good to the animals, the earth, and the people. In each decision I make, these are on my mind as to how I can take a step further for the industry in meeting these, while reaching new milestones in performance and design at the same time.
EO: Eco-vegan fashion was a natural merging of philosophy, creativity, and experiences with a mission to exposure the truth. I started OlsenHaus to be an example of a company that shows compassion and cruelty-free is the truest form of style, and to educate about what is happening to animals and the environmental destruction that effects us all. VN: What is one green thing every vegan should do?
IB: Reduce the amount of garbage you throw out every week. Recycle, compost, [and strive for] waste-free homes as much as possible.
LH: Being vegan is one thing every eco-conscious person should do. But every vegan should take more public transportation and share more. Buy quality that will last forever, that’s sharing with yourself.
EO: Educate, educate, educate, and invite without pretense. Find a way to relate to friends, family, strangers, and introduce them to veganism in a non-confrontational, non-judging way. "

SWISS ANIMAL LAWYERS,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/swiss-animal-lawyers,"FEBRUARY 15, 2010","On March 7, Swiss courts will vote on an initiative that, if passed, will obligate courts to appoint lawyers for animals in cases concerning alleged animal abuse. As a part of the initiative, domestic animals will be given the constitutional right to be represented by lawyers in court. The animal-lawyers initiative has gathered 144,000 signatures but is not supported by the Swiss government, which believes that special offices already set up to deal with animal-abuse cases are sufficient. Due to Switzerland’s policy of popular vote, an initiative needs 100,000 signatures before it can be brought to a national vote and passed into law. "

BECOME A VEGAN GROCERY PRO IN 4 STEPS,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/become-a-vegan-grocery-pro-in-4-steps,"FEBRUARY 14, 2010","Conscientious consumers tend to block grocery store aisles as they scour ingredients lists in search of additives that scream animal cruelty; and while studying the back of the box, they inevitably cause a log jam of scowling shoppers. Not cool. To speed up the scan of bottles, jars, boxes, and cans, come armed with memorized facts and a handy compendium containing the what and what-not of prepackaged foods. Get Smart
Smooth-talking marketers have changed the foodie lexicon to misdirect consumers. We see whey, not cows’ milk; lanolin, not sheep’s wool; and pepsin, not pigs’ stomachs. With thousands of misguiding ingredient names, it’s tricky to steer clear of products that profit off animal suffering. To bypass the marketing circumlocution, it’s important to do a little homework. Learning the Basics
Vegan Shopping 101 schools farm-animal lovers about the usual, sneaky suspects. Take Auntie Glenda’s lovingly crafted JELL-O mold: the gelatin she’s serving is a protein created from boiled cow and pig bones, ligaments, tendons, and skins. (Sorry, Auntie Glenda, I’ll just stick with your soggy, boiled asparagus.) What about the slice of “vegetarian” cheese slapped on the hungry herbivore’s midday sandwich? If the cheese package says rennet or rennin, you’ve been duped into noshing on the fourth stomach of a slaughtered calf, which has been scraped away from surface fat, stretched over drying racks, ground, and mixed with a salt solution. Hold the dubious cheese, please! Some mornings wouldn’t be complete without a toasted English muffin slathered with “vegetarian” cream cheese, but double-check that these don’t contain casein, a dairy-derived protein often found in these breakfast staples. Common culprits like whey, lanolin, and gelatin are easy to memorize and avoid-like plagues and crazy landlords. The Hungry Vegan
All the hungry vegan grocery shopper needs is a tote bag, pleather wallet, and reference list of the pernicious good, bad, and ugly. Agar-agar, caramel color, gluten, guar gum, lactic acid, and lecithin rank high on the veg-friendly scale. Some of the scalawags include albumen, casein, gelatin, isinglass, lactose, lanolin, pepsin, rennet or rennin, tallow, and whey. More comprehensive lists exist in An A-Z Guide to Food Additives, A Consumer’s Dictionary of Food Additives, and Eating Between the Lines. When in Doubt
The simplest way to eliminate nasty additives is to shop sans-packaging! Reducing the purchase of plastic-wrapped goods weakens the market for pre-packaged, manufactured foods. Fresh, whole fruits and vegetables put pep in your step and curb environmentally damaging waste. When in doubt, hone-in on foods with pronounceable ingredients. And next time a trip to Auntie Glenda’s house rolls around, consider bringing some fresh asparagus to bake or steam for the family meal. "

The report specifically focused on Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA), a form of antibiotic-resistant staph that can be life threatening due to difficulties in finding treatments. Thirty-seven workers at a poultry processing plant in Bakesville, Ark., contracted MRSA within weeks of each other, and 64 percent of workers at hog farms in Iowa and Western Illinois showed signs of infection during a separate study. MRSA develops around farmed animals who are given antibiotics to accelerate their growth and to prevent the spread of disease, and can be spread through water runoff, physical contact, or as an airborne bacteria.

When prompted by Colbert to “ruin my next meal,” Foer juxtaposed a romanticized version of American farming with the harsher realities of factory farming, calling such systems “antithetical to American values.” The author detailed the health risks that accompany consuming factory-farmed meat, including swine flu, avian influenza, and a host of other illnesses caused by food-borne pathogens.

California faired best, thanks to its high marks on 45 of the criteria. New Jersey followed in second place, and Colorado, Maine, and Massachusetts all tied for third place. South Dakota joined Idaho, Mississippi and North Dakota at the very bottom of the list, due to the states’ lack of felony penalties for “egregious acts of animal cruelty.” "

The USDA also said it will reevaluate its school lunch suppliers more diligently and drop companies with inconsistent safety records. The new regulatory measures were prompted by a recent USA Today investigation revealing that meat served in fast-food restaurants is more rigorously tested for pathogens than meat served in school lunches. While the new regulations are intended to safeguard schoolchildren from food-borne pathogens, a safer measure would be to institute Meatless Mondays into the government’s school lunch program. "
BLUEFIN BAN,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/bluefin-ban,"FEBRUARY 7, 2010","The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) announced its support of a trade ban on Atlantic bluefin tuna. The Swiss-based body, which regulates international trade in wildlife, will host the CITES triennial meeting in March, where 175 countries will vote on the proposal. Bluefin tuna is highly popular in Japan—one country likely to oppose the ban. Japan imports almost half the world’s total catch, which is considered a top-market luxury tuna—2.2 pounds of fish sell for $200 to $300. The World Wildlife Fund says that spawning bluefin tuna will disappear entirely by 2012 unless catches are halted. "

The reality show pairs celebrities with professional dancers, who perform in dance competitions where viewers determine the winners.

7 FLOWERS GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT (REALLY!),https://vegnews.com/2010/2/7-flowers-good-enough-to-eat-really,"FEBRUARY 5, 2010","Just as parsley can double on dinner plates as spice or garnish, flower petals too can add more than just decorative color to dishes. While parsley is more familiar, flower petals add the same unexpected color, texture, and taste to food, and many varieties of flowers are 100-percent edible—and may already be growing in your own backyard! Make sure, of course, that there are no pesticides on your pansies before ingesting them, and remember to first remove all petals from the bitter white base of the flower before applying them to recipes. 1. Carnations
The petals of this easy-to-find, perennial prom-lapel favorites are sweet and can be used in desserts and as cake decorations. Carnation petals are one of the secret ingredients used to make Chartreuse, a French liqueur. Because they are popular wedding and special occasion flowers, carnations are generally available year-round. 2. Dandelions
Imparting a sweet honey-like flavor and fragrance, the flowers—particularly the buds—are sweetest when picked young and eaten right away. Leaves can be steamed, sautéed, or tossed in salads, and petals look like confetti when sprinkled over a rice dish. 3. Honeysuckle
Whereas the petals have a sweet honey flavor, stay away from the berries, which are highly poisonous! Honeysuckle grows from late spring until the very end of summer, making it a highly accessible flower to spice up summertime recipes. 4. Marigolds
Also known as “poor man’s saffron,” the flavor of marigolds ranges from spicy to bitter and tangy to peppery. Add this aesthetically pleasing foliage to soups, pasta, rice, or salads for an orange-gold glow. Like honeysuckle, marigolds are easy to grow in your home garden all throughout the growing season—watch them bloom from the spring months until winter’s first frost. 5. Nasturtiums
A commonly used edible flower, nasturtiums come in brilliant red, orange, and yellow colors and have a spicy, peppery flavor similar to watercress. Use entire flowers to garnish platters, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers. For a surprise treat, don’t forget to nip off the end of the flower bud and suck out the sweet nectar. 6. Roses
The flavor, depending on type, color, and soil conditions, tends to be reminiscent of strawberries and tart apples. All roses are edible, with the flavor being more pronounced in the darker varieties. Sprinkle on desserts or salads, freeze them in ice cubes, and float them in punches. While these buds get pricy around the holidays, they are available year-round for infusing into your food. 7. Violets
Their sweet, perfumed flavor complements their colorful hues of purple, yellow, blue, or white and can amp up the taste, texture, and color of a salad of mixed greens in no time flat! They are also wonderful additions to iced drinks and can be used to decorate desserts. Freeze them in ice cubes for a pretty presentation in punches. Violets are most widely available and in season during the spring months. "

The ban will not affect rescue or shelter adoptions. The legislation follows a 2009 investigation conducted by the Companion Animal Protection Society (CAPS), which uncovered the sale of puppy-mill and international-import dogs at West Hollywood’s Elite Animals pet store. Based on these findings, the city and the Animal Legal Defense Fund drafted the new ban with the help of CAPS. West Hollywood was also the first US city to ban cat declawing. "
ARIZONA ANIMAL-TESTING BILL,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/arizona-animal-testing-bill,"FEBRUARY 2, 2010","A bill reducing anti-cruelty restrictions on animal testing in scientific facilities is making its way through the Arizona State Senate after narrowly passing a Senate committee on Monday, February 1. Currently, Arizona law “prohibits the neglect, abandonment, cruel mistreatment, or unnecessary physical injury of an animal with intent or knowledge on the part of the person committing the act.” If passed, the bill will exclude federally regulated research facilities from state regulations, leaving scientific animal testing with very few state-mandated restrictions. The Federal Animal Welfare Act, established in 1966, sets minimum acceptable standards for the treatment of animals in research on a national level, but state regulations are generally much stricter.

LEPRINO DROPS WILLET DAIRY,https://vegnews.com/2010/2/leprino-drops-willet-dairy,"FEBRUARY 1, 2010","Last Thursday, Denver-based cheese supplier Leprino Foods announced the removal of Willet Dairy from its list of milk suppliers. Leprino Foods, which supplies cheese to the three largest pizza chains in the US—Papa John’s, Pizza Hut, and Domino’s—acted after the release of Mercy for Animals’ (MFA) exposé of Willet Dairy. The investigation revealed numerous counts of animal cruelty, including tail docking and leaving “downed” cows to suffer without veterinary care. Leprino Senior Vice President, Mike Reidy, says the company is concerned with animal welfare and takes these findings seriously. CNN and ABC have provided coverage of MFA’s findings.     "

The group hopes to gather more than 600,000 signatures from voters once the petition receives approval from the Secretary of the State. Ohio would join a small number of states with similar cruelty-prevention laws, including Michigan, Arizona, California, Oregon, Colorado, Florida, and Maine. "

FIGURE SKATER DROPS FUR,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/figure-skater-drops-fur,"JANUARY 31, 2010","Two weeks ago, three-time figure skating champion and Winter Olympics competitor Johnny Weir wore a costume adorned with fox fur at the 2010 AT&T Figure Skating Championships, which generated criticism from animal-rights organizations. On January 28, Weir said that he would replace the fox fur on his 2010 Olympic Games costume with faux fur. Friends of Animals issued an open letter to Weir, calling for the removal of fox fur from his costume. Weir explained that his focus is currently on training and technique, not pressure from animal-rights groups. In a statement released last week, the skater expressed concerns that an animal-rights representative may disrupt his performance at the Vancouver games if he chose to continue wearing genuine fox fur, jeopardizing his chance to earn a gold medal.

Longtime vegetarian Partouche went vegan in 2009, and had already made a conscious decision to not include fur, leather, and feathers in his designs. His recent decision to also exclude wool came after realizing it was now incongruous with his vegan lifestyle. Patrouche’s pieces are available in the US, Japan, the UK, and France, and will soon be made available worldwide via an online store. "
MEAT ALTERNATIVES EXAMINED,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/meat-alternatives-examined,"JANUARY 31, 2010","Recently, GOOD compared the sustainability and environmental impact of meat compared to three popular varieties of meat alternatives—tofu, seitan, and tempeh. The conclusion was that while organic, locally produced, and grass-fed meat might produce less of an impact on the planet, that meat-free substitutions are ultimately the most sustainable and healthful option available to consumers. Last week, Slate examined the controversial issue of grass-fed cows versus cows fed only grain on factory farms and concluded that health risks were almost identical among the two. Both investigations encouraged reducing meat consumption from diets. "
VEGAN SUPER BOWL SOIRÉE,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/vegan-super-bowl-soiree,"JANUARY 31, 2010","Whether your knowledge of third-down conversions and first-round draft picks rivals John Madden’s, or you pick your favorite team based on the color of its jerseys, the Super Bowl can be an intimidating affair for vegans. While the media may have you believe it’s an event meant exclusively for inhaling chicken wings and sloshing back beer in a bar, hosting your own vegan Super Bowl party at home can be an easy way to ensure you enjoy the big game without compromising your ideals. Here are some simple ways to throw an animal-free football extravaganza, with plenty of time left to cheer on your favorite team.

Game-Time Grub
Chips and dip are always a crowd-pleasing option, due to the ease of consumption and short bowl-to-mouth time. Watch your guests inhale chips with this simple guacamole recipe, or serve with crudités for a healthier dipping alternative. Serving vegan wings is much simpler, and no longer means a trip to the natural-foods store. Brands like MorningStar Farms and Gardein both make delicious barbeque meat-alternatives, which can be found in a number of large grocery stores’ frozen-food sections. Whip up a side of vegan ranch dressing and watch people jump on those wings faster than players on a fumble. Chili, another Super Bowl staple, can be prepared in advance and left in a slow cooker to avoid missing game time or impromptu reenactments of the Super Bowl shuffle. You can keep it classic with a fiery Two-Alarm Chili, or give the hearty dish a Sweet Potato or Chocolate Chili twist. Serve it up during The Who’s half-time show, when guests are most likely to take the time to actually use utensils.

State Snacks
While team colors are a simple way to show your pride, indulging in foods from each team’s city is an inventive way to show solidarity. Indiana may not have an official state food, but breaded-pork sandwiches and Van Camp’s pork and beans are both commonly associated with the capital city. For pig-friendly versions, try a breaded-tofu sandwich, or cook up a big batch of Tempeh BBQ Baked Beans instead. If you want to support the Colts with some simple snacking, nosh on a bowl of DIY popcorn—Indiana is the home state of Orville Redenbacher.  A mention of the state of Louisiana commonly conjures up images of creole creations and Cajun comfort food, and New Orleans is no exception. The state’s official cuisine, gumbo, and donut, beignets, are both readily available in the Big Easy and easily veganized at home. For inspiration, check out the veggie gumbo recipe from VegWeb, or try rolling vegan doughnut holes in powdered sugar to mimic a beignet. If you’re more in the mood for finger food, the multi-layered muffaletta sandwich is a New Orleans staple, and just as delicious loaded with faux meat and non-dairy cheese.

Can’t-Beat Beverages
Like jerseys and chest bumps, football and beer are a nearly inseparable combination. While not all beers are vegan, safe bets include game day stand-bys Budweiser, Corona, Coors, and Miller. For those with lighter palates, Mike’s Hard Lemonade is produced without animal products, and O’Douls offers a vegan non-alcoholic brew. You can also mix up a batch of virgin Hurricanes by filling a punch bowl 3/4 full with a combination of orange juice and pineapple juice, and topping it off with sweet and sour mix and grenadine—just don’t tell Indianapolis fans they’re enjoying a drink invented in New Orleans.

This is the latest in a slew of recent, impromptu vegan bake sale benefits that have been happening across the country. Last week, a group of vegans in New York City held a bake sale benefit at vegan-shoe boutique Moo Shoes. Post Punk Kitchen is encouraging all vegans to plan bake sale fundraisers in their hometowns.

Actions will take place in 51 cities and 12 countries—including South Africa, Switzerland, Bolivia, Portugal, France, and the US.

STARS BACK HORSE BILL,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/stars-back-horse-bill,"JANUARY 29, 2010","On January 26, actors Kelly Carlson (Nip/Tuck) and Wendie Mallick (Just Shoot Me) joined members of Humane Society of the United States to lobby Congress for a horse-rights bill. Such legislation would prevent the transportation of horses to slaughterhouses in Canada and Mexico and end the round-up of wild horses by US authorities. Horse slaughterhouses currently do not exist in the US, but demand for horsemeat comes from Belgian-owned companies that supply the meat to Europe. The bill is backed by Michigan Democrat John Conyers in the House, and Democrat Mary Landrieu and Republican John Ensign in the Senate. "
CA FORMS ANIMAL CAUCUS,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/ca-forms-animal-caucus,"JANUARY 28, 2010","A group of California state legislators have joined to form the state’s Animal Protection Caucus, one of the nation’s first legislative caucuses exclusively focused on animal welfare.

The policy also applies to Target-owned brands Market Pantry and Archer Farms, which are sold in grocery stores across the US. The retail chain will now carry wild-caught Alaskan salmon, meeting the sustainability standards of the Marine Stewardship Council, an independent non-profit organization that monitors fishing practices worldwide. Greenpeace believes that Target’s new policy will prompt other seafood retailers to carry sustainably sourced products. Target is a Minneapolis-based company with more than 1,700 stores in 49 states. "
GRASS-FED FALLACY DEBUNKED,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/grass-fed-fallacy-debunked,"JANUARY 28, 2010","This week, Slate examined the health consequences of eating grass-fed beef, and concluded that this method of farming presents an equal risk for deadly bacteria contamination. Scientific studies suggest that one strain of fatal E. coli bacteria can inhabit cows fed only grass at almost the same rate as cows fed grain on factory farms. In recent years, grass-fed proponents have claimed that E. coli contamination and its resulting meat recalls have been due to unhealthy factory-farming practices, and that grass-fed cows are less likely to harbor harmful bacteria.

Workers are seen tail-docking, kicking, electric-shocking, and punching cows. The factory-farm findings have received attention from national media outlets, including coverage by World News with Diane Sawyer and Nightline. Leading animal-welfare specialists liken the footage to another factory-farm exposé that led to the largest beef recall in the US. Willet Dairy supplies cheese for pizza chains Domino’s, Pizza Hut, and Papa John’s. "

The law, which is part of China’s first draft bill against animal abuse, will be submitted to the National People’s Congress in March. If the law is passed, individual consumption will be punishable with up to 15 days in prison, and its sale can cost a business the equivalent of more than $73,000. The growing number of Chinese households with companion animals might be a possible cause of the changing mentality toward dog and cat consumption. "
CORPORATION RECALLS MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/corporation-recalls-meat,"JANUARY 26, 2010","On January 23, Rhode Island-based meat processing plant Daniele International issued a voluntary recall of 1.24 million pounds of 18 peppered-salami products. In the past seven months, almost 200 people in 38 states have reported salmonella infection after eating Daniele products, though none have died. The company believes its pepper ingredients are a possible cause of the epidemic, based on preliminary research. The US Department of Agriculture reports that no federal or state testing has established a firm link between the corporation’s pepper and the salmonella outbreak. The USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, which enforces a zero-tolerance policy for salmonella in meats, continues to investigate. "

The article doesn’t focus on Goodwin’s career, but rather her ethical journey towards adopting a vegan lifestyle. Goodwin says she never stopped liking the taste of meat, but chose veganism to reduce cruelty and suffering. Oprah has featured other vegan celebrities both on-air and in print, including comedian Ellen DeGeneres, actress Portia de Rossi, and vegan chef Tal Ronnen. Forbes Magazine ranks Oprah as the second most powerful celebrity, and in recent years the mega-star has used her fortune and fame as a platform to help bring veganism into the mainstream. "
PRISONS TO OFFER VEG MEALS,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/prisons-to-offer-veg-meals,"JANUARY 25, 2010","Vegetarian meals may soon be offered in California prisons based on personal or ethical preference, according to a regulation proposed earlier this month by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). The new regulation would affect all prisons and correctional facilities statewide. In addition to offering a separate vegetarian option, the provision also includes meal alternatives for Jewish kosher diets and meat substitutions for Muslim inmates. Currently, inmates can only petition for vegetarian meals based on religious beliefs—personal and ethical vegetarianism are not recognized. CDCR officials say that the decision to add these meal options was made after inmates filed lawsuits claiming discrimination. "
VEGAN PANINI WINS CONTEST,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/vegan-panini-wins-contest,"JANUARY 25, 2010","Last Thursday, the vegan entry at Coral Tree Café’s “Panini-Off,” submitted by Chloe Coscarelli, blew past the meat and dairy options to claim first prize at the Los Angeles eatery. Coscarelli’s Mango Masala Panini, a combination of spiced chickpea masala, roasted cauliflower curry, and tamarind-mango chutney, beat out four other finalists. Entries were chosen based on taste, visual presentation, creativity, and “panini practicality”—how easy it was to eat. A graduate of UC Berkeley, 22-year-old Coscarelli also studied at The Natural Gourmet Institute before becoming a vegan chef. Coscarelli’s winning sandwich will be added to Coral Tree Café’s menu, which previously did not offer a vegan panini option. She is currently in talks with the restaurant about developing and expanding its vegan selection. "

As of January 1, Great Sage adopted an all-vegan menu, substituting coconut milk and non-dairy cheese in specific menu items and eliminating all animal products from the restaurant. The change was prompted by a desire to keep the eatery more in line with its mission statement and to reduce suffering, promote health, and lessen its impact on the environment.

MEAT SAFETY QUESTIONED,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/meat-safety-questioned,"JANUARY 23, 2010","Last Friday, the Chicago Tribune released an article investigating recent meat recalls and examined the health consequences of consuming factory-farmed meat and poultry. The article goes into great detail about the different safety and health risks inherent to factory-farming practices, such as spraying meat with ammonia, injecting chlorine into chickens, and carbon-monoxide exposure to meat during packaging. Earlier this week, a recall was issued for 864,000 pounds of meat produced at a California meat processing plant. While the amount alone was staggering, the act of recalling contaminated meat has become an increasingly common practice for the industry. "
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “VEGAN” AND “HEALTHY”,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/the-difference-between-vegan-and-healthy,"JANUARY 23, 2010","One of the biggest and most common misconceptions about veganism is that compassionate living means eating bland food and saying goodbye to beloved junk food indulgences. Of course, vegans know better. From independent plant-based bakeries to supermarket shelves piled high with Oreos and Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos, fattening vegan-friendly snacks are well within reach. It’s easy to forget that “vegan-friendly” does not always equal “healthy alternative” and so it’s necessary to take a closer look at the ingredients to really understand how healthful these options are.

Convenience at a Cost
Indulging in plant-based, processed convenience foods on a regular basis means we’re increasing our intake of simple carbohydrates such as white flour (cookies), white pasta (prepared soups), and white rice (frozen dinners) and even white potatoes (potato chips). The body doesn’t have to do much work to digest these foods, and therefore treats them as sugars. The consumption of these “white” foods increases insulin production, which, in turn, increases visceral fat—that’s the dreaded belly fat we all know and loathe. Continued exposure to processed carbohydrates and sugars causes the body to send the types of hormonal messages that are designed to react in times of food scarcity. This, in turn, causes the body to crave more food. This becomes a vicious cycle of overconsumption and weight gain.

“No Trans Fats”
The consumption of trans-fatty acids has been linked to diabetes, coronary heart disease, and sudden cardiac death—they are definitely something to avoid! Looking for a “no trans fats” label on your food is a step in the right direction. But beware—“no trans fats” does not mean that the product is free of artery-clogging saturated fats, nor does it mean that the product is low fat. If you’re craving chips, try non-GMO soy chips, which tend to be high in flavor and nutrients like protein and calcium, but low in fat. Olive oil makes an excellent spread for bread, and safflower oil is a much healthier alternative to shortening for baking.

“Fruit Sweetened”
When we think of fruit, we think of a healthy part of our daily diets, and rightly so. If a product is sweetened with fruit sugars, it’s logical to conclude that the product is also a much healthier alternative to one sweetened any other way. However, as far as the human body is concerned, sugar is sugar, no matter the source. Fruit sugars are metabolized quickly by the body, and have a similar metabolic response to regular sugars. They provide the same surge in insulin production, and contribute to that same cycle of overeating and weight gain. Fructose is sweeter than sugar, and does not convert to energy as efficiently as glucose does. As a result, it is more easily converted to fat. There really is no “healthy” sugar, and this includes “natural” sweeteners. As a general rule, try to limit foods with added sugars. For a sweet snack, opt for unsweetened dried fruit, fruit leathers, or energy bars.

“All Natural”
The term “all natural” is not regulated, and therefore, just about anything on supermarket shelves can be termed “all natural,” and still contain large amounts of decidedly unnatural ingredients. As a basic rule of thumb, read labels and make sure that you understand all of the ingredients in your food. This way, you can make informed decisions on what you are consuming. Monitor your portion sizes, eat plenty of whole grains, fresh fruit and vegetables, and make sure you get at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day. If you’re doing all of this, you can safely include your favorite foods into your diet—in moderation. "
10 MUST-READ VEG BOOKS,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/10-must-read-veg-books,"JANUARY 23, 2010","Resolve to read more this decade but having trouble deciding which tome to crack next? Want to delve into works penned by veg authors but don’t know where to start? Joseph Connelly shares the influential works he’d be unable to live without.

Neal Barnard: The first book I read after going vegan was The Power of Your Plate. I think I’ve read each of Neal’s books since, though I can’t really be sure, as they do blend into one another.

Steve Best: With titles including Postmodern Theory: Critical Observations and Igniting a Revolution: Voices in Defense of the Earth, surely you can see why. The best thing? Steve has written or edited 10 books, so you have plenty to catch up on.

Jim Mason: His An Unnatural Order: Roots of Our Destruction of Nature remains the most comprehensive document yet published coalescing current global concerns, how we got here, and how to move beyond. Plus, with Mason, you (often) get Singer (Animal Factories, The Way We Eat).

Jeffrey Masson: Given his catalog—both his psychological/Freudian work before, and his animal work since the classic When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals—this one’s a no-brainer. Prolific Masson has written about every animal from the armadillo to the zebra, always with clarity and feeling. And now he’s tackling veganism.

Victoria Moran: Author of the timeless The Love-Powered Diet: Eating for Freedom, Health, and Joy, Moran’s warm words always leave one feeling enlightened, a truly remarkable talent in that her recent works (Fat, Broke, and Lonely No More and Creating a Charmed Life) deal with serious, modern issues.
 
Frances Moore Lappé: Her Diet for a Small Planet remains the bible from which all food politics can be traced. Nearly four decades later, she’s still very active, recently with Getting a Grip: Clarity, Creativity, and Courage in a World Gone Mad as well as The Small Planet Fund, started with daughter, Anna.

Laura Moretti: Others produce quantity, Moretti pens quality. Author of two thin volumes of essays and editorials culled from her work as a journalist, All Heaven in a Rage: Essays on the Eating of Animals and The Good Fight: Speaking for Those Who Can’t, Moretti’s moving prose is what lesser writers read to get inspired.

Tom Regan: Regan’s career-spanning work includes the seminal The Case for Animal Rights, which, if you haven’t read, you should, along with any other of Regan’s cogent, thought-provoking works.

John Robbins: His books on health care (Reclaiming Our Health) and aging (Healthy At 100) could make one value the isolation of exile, while Diet for a New America remains the turning point in modern veg history, turning more people away from a meat-based diet than any work before or since.

Mickey Z.: The NYC-based social critic’s books involve not so much veg or animal concerns, but rather issues of justice; an edgier, concise Howard Zinn. If you’d like your library to be rounded out a bit, Z.’s style and substance will be much appreciated, especially 50 American Revolutions You’re Not Supposed to Know and The Seven Deadly Spins: Exposing the Lies Behind War Propaganda.

CALIFORNIA’S FUR LOOPHOLE,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/californias-fur-loophole,"JANUARY 21, 2010","This past Wednesday, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma, D-San Francisco, introduced legislation in California to correct a legal loophole that allows the inclusion of animal fur on garments without any indicator the fur is real. Because of the loophole, retailers and manufacturers currently do not have to disclose if the article of clothing contains real fur if the value of the item is under $150. Ma’s Assembly bill would require conspicuous labeling in California of any clothing containing real fur, regardless of price. If the bill is adopted, California will join New York, Delaware, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin as the sixth state with a fur-labeling law. "

Eating contaminated meat will often lead to obvious health problems, but strands of the bacteria can lie dormant in the intestines and not cause immediate reactions. Researchers found that this latent strand of E. coli bacteria can later travel from the intestines to the urethra, causing urinary tract infections. The study is also examining the health consequences of eating antibiotic-treated meat. The Public Health Agency of Canada and the University of Guelph compiled sample data for the study in Canada. "
PUTIN ON US POULTRY,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/putin-on-us-poultry,"JANUARY 20, 2010","This week, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin voiced support for a new Russian policy that limits the amount of chlorine-treated poultry to enter its borders. The government enacted the policy on January 1. Putin, citing health and safety reasons, singled out American agribusiness for its failure to demonstrate compliance with Russian standards for poultry production. Russia now joins the EU, which enforces a similar ban on chlorine-treated poultry. The ban is part of a larger government project to phase out poultry imports and rely solely on domestic poultry by 2015. This year, Russia expects to decrease its US poultry quotas by 20 percent. "

Karlgaard acknowledged that conservative men might be leery of vegetarianism, as they believe it evokes images of an “eco-hippie” who “eschews deodorant.” Karlgaard instead cites health reasons for his motivation to change his diet. At 55, Karlgaard had gained 30 pounds since graduating from Stanford in the mid-70s. Last year, he improved his fitness levels by cycling and consuming mostly vegan food, which sped up his post-workout recovery.

POTENTIAL BAN ON TUNA TRADE,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/potential-ban-on-tuna-trade,"JANUARY 19, 2010","In the face of commercial extinction, the country of Monaco has proposed a ban on the exportation of Atlantic bluefin tuna by placing it under an international endangered species protection agreement. By listing Atlantic bluefin tuna under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the species would be protected from trade and only allowed for domestic consumption in the EU, where demand is already low. Species numbers fell by nearly 75 percent from 1957 to 2007, to less than 15 percent of historical levels, according to the International Commission on the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT). Vocal opposition is expected from Japan, which buys nearly 80 percent of the annual bluefin catch, and a number of Mediterranean nations, where the majority of tuna is caught and shipped. "

PUT YOUR FRESHEST FACE FORWARD WITH THESE DIY TIPS,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/put-your-freshest-face-forward-with-these-diy-tips,"JANUARY 16, 2010","In our January+February issue, VN reveals five great ways that fruits and veggies can rejuvenate skin—whether as a snack or face mask. Yes, the produce section can also easily double as the personal care aisle when it comes to natural approaches to skin, hair, and nail care. Not only are these home remedies all-natural alternatives free of harsh chemicals, but they also have the added benefit of doubling as delicious treats—avocado moisture mask or afternoon treat? Either way, you’re nourishing your body with pure, necessary nutrients. Check out these additional methods of do-it-yourself personal care. To be (organic) or not to be
Organic produce can cost you a pretty penny, so is it worth it when it comes to DIY skin care? Acclaimed author, raw food chef, and green-living diva extraordinaire Ani Phyo puts it this way: “It’s important to use organic whenever possible because anything we put on our skin is the same as eating it, since it’s absorbed through our skin into our body. It’s a good idea to always keep toxic chemicals we take into our bodies to a minimum since we get enough toxins from our environment, in the air we breathe, the fabrics we wear on our skin, and in the water we shower in.” The bottom line: If you’re already willing to spend a little extra to make your skin feel pampered and protected, organic is clearly the way to go. Do you know your ABCs?
Here’s something we wish we had learned in kindergarten: How to snack your way to better skin. Vitamins A, C, and E work together to build collagen and keep skin firm. They also protect against wrinkles, fine lines, and UV damage, keeping skin smooth and youthful. Colorful fruits and veggies like berries, citrus fruits, melon, corn, and peppers will also keep you looking lovely since they’re good sources of these vitamins. Snack on nuts and seeds to amp up vitamin E intake—and thus turn back the clock on aging skin. B vitamins—found in peaches, bananas, melon, and strawberries—form skin, nail, and hair cells, and also improve cardiovascular health to help you achieve that gorgeous, sun-kissed glow. Also, don’t be scared to stock up on essential fatty acids, or EFAs, to reduce inflammation and wrinkles and improve overall complexion. You can get omega 3s from flax seeds, hemp seeds, avocados, and spirulina, and omega 6s from nuts and grains. Berry Nice Skin
For some, açaí berries are a semi-sweet treat addictive enough to pop like candy. For others, they offer a less enjoyable experience. Fortunately, there is good news for both camps: whether eaten or applied topically, açai berries pack a healthy punch. These blue-purple berries boast vitamins and high antioxidant levels, helping to fight free radicals that can damage skin. So, what does this mean for moisturizing? Açaí combats premature aging, nourishes skin cells, and helps balance overall skin tone. If you prefer açaí shaken into a cream—and not stirred into your yogurt—simply combine mashed berries with one tablespoon oil and one tablespoon mineral salts and mash to create a thick paste. Scrub, exfoliate, and enjoy! "

Although one-third of the population remains obese, this figure has plateaued, indicating a halt in the number of people developing obesity. It’s been proven that excess weight is one of the primary contributors to early-onset diabetes and cardiovascular disease—a 2009 study found that participants assigned to eat processed meats, such as lunch meats or hot dogs, experienced a 41 percent jump in their risk of developing diabetes, while people who adhered to a plant-based diet were 50 percent less likely to develop the disease.

The quake registered a 7.0 magnitude, and its epicenter was just south of Port-au-Prince, the country’s capital, resulting in widespread destruction. Global government aid agencies are marshalling relief teams and search-and-rescue groups to respond swiftly to the crisis. In the US, vegans are rallying to contribute by holding bake sales in New York, Portland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.

SCIENCE ENDS ANIMAL TESTING,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/science-ends-animal-testing,"JANUARY 14, 2010","Researchers from Hurel Corporation have created new technology that could soon end animal testing in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, household cleaners, and pesticides. This new, cruelty-free method of testing involves placing human cells and chemicals, which mimic the body’s immune system, on a small glass chip. Products can then be applied to the chip to assess the reaction. Scientists say this method of testing is more efficient and could be available by next year. The study was partly funded by cosmetics behemoth L’Oreal—a company that does not test finished products on animals. "

FARMERS ENCOURAGED TO MOVE,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/farmers-encouraged-to-move,"JANUARY 13, 2010","States without protective legislation for farm animals, like Idaho, Georgia, and Nevada, are offering California farmers incentives to relocate. This past Sunday, at the Wilson County Farm Bureau, American Farm Bureau president Bob Stallman called on factory farms to aggressively respond to welfare reform “extremists,” referring to voters like those in California who overwhelmingly passed Prop. 2, which will phase out battery cages by 2015. The states without protective legislation like Prop. 2 are appealing to farmers’ fears that moving to more humane systems will drive up overhead costs. Wayne Pacelle, CEO of the Humane Society of the United States, says relocation to unregulated states is only a short-term solution because consumers are increasingly demanding humane conditions for food animals.

Mills has insisted on performing in leather-free skates, prompting producers to seek out vegan skate-wear from American company Riedell, which uses synthetic leather substitute Clarino. On last Sunday’s fifth season premiere, Mills skated past the other competition and avoided elimination, despite difficulties due to her prosthetic limb’s inability to bend at the ankle. Mills, whose campaigning for animal rights, environmental issues, and human rights helped land her the title of VN Person of the Year in 2009, hopes appearing on the show will spotlight the many charities she supports, including Humane Society International and Farm Sanctuary.

While crossing the street near his home in Brooklyn, a minivan struck Rollino, who died in a hospital.

CALIFORNIA’S NEW GREEN LAWS,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/californias-new-green-laws,"JANUARY 12, 2010","On Monday, a California state panel recommended that fees being taxed on residential and commercial greenhouse-gas emissions be allocated to energy-saving citizens, serving as an incentive for more members of the Golden State to go green. These funds would be distributed as annual dividend checks and could result in refunds of more than $1000 for a family of four. This week, in an unrelated government effort to increase sustainable living, California will adopt a statewide green building code that will reduce water use, require recycling of building material waste, and more strongly enforce energy efficiency in newly built schools, commercial buildings, hospitals, and homes.

AMMONIA BURGERS,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/ammonia-burgers,"JANUARY 11, 2010","A recent New York Times exposé has revealed that South Dakota-based Beef Products Inc. is injecting its meat with ammonia to kill off E. coli and salmonella pathogens. Although the company claims that the chemical reduces deadly bacteria to “undetectable levels,” further reports show that the strains still exist even after the injections. Furthermore, the USDA is now allowing the company to sell the ammonia-laced, bacteria-positive beef to fast-food restaurants like McDonald’s and Burger King, and the federal school lunch program. Previously, the treated meat was only allowed to be sold to manufacturers of pet food. "
VETERINARY WORD CHOICE,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/veterinary-word-choice,"JANUARY 10, 2010","Even the difference between the terms “owner” and “guardian” can have a definitive impact on how veterinarian treatment for companion animals and farmed animals differs. At the Joint Educational Symposium on Animal Welfare, Dr. Candace C. Croney compared the variation in terminology used when discussing small animals versus food animals. From her research, she found “service” and “health care” were more commonly used for horses and livestock, whereas terms like “humane” and “compassion” were favored for companion animals. Word choice, she asserts, influences what a veterinarian will consider “humane treatment” when diagnosing and treating the animal. In her experience, vets may be more willing to inflict a greater level of pain on animals that are not seen as an extension of the family. "

In 2001, actress Johanna McCloy became frustrated at the lack of vegetarian options offered at a baseball game and petitioned the concession manager for more meat-free options. This became the birth of Soy Happy Day, a special day McCloy founded to encourage and remind vegetarians everywhere that sometimes, as Ghandi said, “you must be the change that you wish to see in the world.” This year, spend Soy Happy Day championing for more veg-friendly food in your community.

5 WINTER FITNESS TIPS,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/5-winter-fitness-tips,"JANUARY 9, 2010","Winter may be far from over, but it’s not too soon to start getting back your beach body after a season of sweets. Yes, the hibernation impulse is tough to fight. While a little down time is therapeutic, make it your goal right now to take action, alter stagnating behaviors, and implement new tools to step it up and get in shape this year. Figure out what steps need to be taken, and get ready to say, “Today is the day I’m going to make it happen.” These five simple, practical health tips will help you uncover your best body yet, get healthier, and increase energy. What better way to start the new decade? Step 1: Eat fruit for breakfast. Fruit contains all the components it needs to digest and requires little assistance from the body. Fruit in the AM will awaken the body and stimulate elimination channels, which is an important factor for improved health and weight loss. Breakfast is easy—just grab a piece and go! Step 2: Eat at least one green salad every day. Greens are so important because they contain an array of nutrients in perfect proportion to nourish the body’s tissues and cells, and plenty of amino acids to help you build muscle. If you find it difficult to eat a salad everyday, try a green smoothie. Knock out the first two steps simultaneously by adding leafy greens to your morning smoothie. Fruit helps mask the “green” taste, making for a healthy and delicious meal. Step 3: Find an enjoyable form of physical activity and schedule it into your day. Exercise doesn’t have to take a long time. Wake up 15 minutes earlier and perform a quick, high-intensity workout to get blood and lymph moving. If you’re pressed for time, check out CrossFit, a strength and conditioning program adaptable to all levels of fitness. By 9am, you’re more than halfway through the list. Step 4: Cut out sodas and bottled beverages. Full of either refined sugar or sugar substitutes, these sugary drinks do nothing but detract from your overall health. If it’s the fizz factor you love, try drinking sparkling water with fresh lime. If you’re hooked on sugar, replace your daily soda with kombucha, a fermented beverage containing probiotics, which aid digestion. Feel a caffeine headache coming on? Sip yerba maté tea, an infusion similar to green tea. While maté contains caffeine, most people don’t experience the negative side effects tied to coffee and soda, such as jitteriness, headaches, and nausea. Step 5: Eliminate fried foods, which are detrimental for two reasons. First, they contain harmful, artery-clogging trans fats. To steer clear, read the labels on any packaged food and look for “hydrogenated,” “partially hydrogenated,” and “shortening” listed as ingredients—all are indicators of trans fats. Secondly, they are typically fried in polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as soybean, which is highly susceptible to heat damage. Exposure to heat, like that of a deep fryer, creates free radicals, which have been linked to cancer. For a satisfying snack with healthy fat, try a slice of toasted sprouted-grain bread topped with nut butter.

VEGAN FASHION GALORE AT NEW HAVEN’S KERIN BOUTIQUE,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/vegan-fashion-galore-at-new-havens-kerin-boutique,"JANUARY 9, 2010","Less than two years ago, Jackie Kerin sat at the kitchen table with her parents, Chris and Andrea, discussing the ups and downs of her venture in veganism. While the lifestyle proved satisfying, the college-aged woman had trouble stocking her wardrobe with styles not only considered fashionable, but easily accessible and environmentally friendly. The family began searching for a solution, first with frequent trips to New York City, visiting designers and exploring the fashion world. When the perfect antique building just steps from Yale University became available, Chris Kerin made his move and snatched up the space. Nine months, one green design overhaul, and a meticulous inventory selection later, the family’s boutique was officially born. The stylish shop, which sports the family’s last name, is the first all-vegan boutique in New Haven, Conn., selling men’s and women’s wear from affordable attire to upscale chic. With classic vegan designers on standby, including Matt & Nat and Olsen Haus, Kerin also keeps an eye out for up and coming designers—local, national, and beyond—as well as any cutting-edge cruelty-free fashions. Opening its doors in early December 2009, Kerin is already making its mark on the Connecticut college town. Chris Kerin took VN behind the scenes of the new shop and its compassionate philosophy. VegNews: Kerin’s philosophy is dedicated to veganism and the environment, and you’ve mentioned educating employees on causes. How do you include employees in your mission?
Chris Kerin: There are five colleges in New Haven, and several of our employees are students either locally, or in NYC internships. Most of the people we interviewed loved fashion, had someone close to them who was vegan, and had an interest in helping animals and the environment. Our employees are involved in our buying process, and are quickly becoming experts on how our fashions benefit animals and the environment. While we don’t require employees to become vegan, we encourage them to make one choice each day that benefits animals. VN: Do you have any plans for animal-rights fundraisers or events?
CK: We are working with animal-rights groups both locally and nationally to help animals, and are currently selling a custom-designed bulldog charity tee, with all profits benefiting animal charities. We will have a contest each season for a new charity tee design. Designers can submit their designs on our website. We started Kerin to help animals. Our goal is to make it easy and convenient to live an eco-friendly, vegan lifestyle, without sacrificing fashion. Any profits from the store will be used to expand the concept and support animal charities. VN: You’ve taken care to include some important green initiatives in the stores’ operations. What makes Kerin both vegan and green?
CK: Green is vegan. In the store design, we used state-of-the-art low voltage LED lighting, eco-friendly Italian tile flooring, and shelving and table tops made from recycled materials. We even have a display table repurposed from the hood of a ‘70s VW Super Beetle. Our designer clothing is produced using sustainable production methods, incorporating fabrics such as organic cotton and bamboo. We benefit the planet by eliminating leather and other animal products from our fashions. VN: How do you see veganism evolving within New Haven, as well as the city’s potential impact on veganism as a whole?
CK: I can envision New Haven growing in the future and embracing the green movement. Most vegans I’ve met have one thing in common—they’re smart. They think for themselves, and don’t just blindly follow the herd. New Haven is young and smart—there’s a lot of talent and creativity in the city. Photo by Carol Hsin, Yale Daily News "

New legislation was passed on Thursday to punish people who spread (with ill intent) images of animal abuse on the internet.

VEGGIE STARTER KITS,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/veggie-starter-kits,"JANUARY 8, 2010","Veggie starter kits are valuable reading material for both curious omnivores and dedicated vegans alike.

To hear first-hand accounts about going veg, consult VegNews’ Go-Veg Guide, which details how five editors came to adopt veganism—and also includes a host of classic VN recipes. If appealing to animal-rights and welfare issues is the biggest catalyst for going veg, download the starter kits published by Humane Society of the United States, PETA, Mercy for Animals, and Compassion Over Killing. However the decision comes about, it will lead to a happier and healthier 2010 for the animals, the environment, and you. "

A Chipotle representative confirmed that this practice has been changed, and that its meat-free protein is now cooked in a separate pan with vegan-friendly fajita veggies. "

HEALTHY NEW YEAR!,https://vegnews.com/2010/1/healthy-new-year,"JANUARY 5, 2010","As the mad holiday rush begins to wind down, another time-honored tradition takes hold of thousands of people across the US—the predictable, often short-lived New Year’s resolution. Almost anyone could guess the nation’s most popular goal come January 1: Lose weight, get healthy. The ultimate goal isn’t about fitting a specific ideal of beauty, but improving overall health and well-being. To keep 2010 from ending up like years past—burnt out by Valentine’s Day with a box of chocolates to yourself—aspiring health superstars can find support in one of many online vegan nutrition programs. Each program aims to establish healthy eating habits, partly by offering participants a variety of resources for reprogramming their nutritional hazards. With a hearty dose of nutrient-packed recipes, daily e-mails, community message boards, exercise tips and beyond, “fit” has gone 21st century. Whether you’re veg-curious, vegetarian, or a junk-food vegan, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) presents an all-inclusive program to help solidify healthy habits. The 21-Day Vegan Kickstart, beginning January 1, includes three weeks of balanced meal plans and recipes, celebrity coaches, doctors’ tips, a healthy foods guide, and an extensive FAQ to cover your nutritional bases-and that’s just the beginning. “For 21 days, you’ll have everything we can offer to not only inspire and educate, but [we’ll] be there to hold your hand,” says Susan Levin, PCRM dietitian. Focusing on whole, plant-based foods, PCRM’s meal plan is perfect for those transitioning to a vegan diet, or looking to clean up a potato-chip-laden one. Recipes are designed to be filling as well as appetizing, such as black-bean burritos or grilled portabellos helping to curb the feared hunger many expect on a diet. For faster results, PCRM includes fitness tips from top vegan athletes such as Scott Jurek, Brendan Brazier, and John Salley. “Find an activity you enjoy. Even if someone has had amazing results on some exercise program, don’t do it because you think it’s going to work for you if you don’t like it. If you have to force yourself to do an exercise you don’t like, you don’t benefit from it, Brazier explains. “Stress is involved, and cortisol, the stress hormone, goes out which inhibits your ability to sleep deeply and build muscle, so you’re being counterproductive,” says Brazier. Instead, he suggests finding an activity you enjoy that also adds balance to your life. For example, if you mostly work in solitude, try joining a team sport or group exercise to complement flying solo. If a bustling office sets the stage for your day job, take up a solo activity such as cycling, running, or swimming to indulge in some much-deserved alone time. Maybe you’re already vegan, but want to fine-tune your eating with a slightly stricter regime. By eliminating major toxins and allergens, including tobacco, alcohol, gluten, refined sugar, as well as all animal products, vegan chef and wellness guru Moira Nordholt takes participants on her own 21-day journey, the Feel-Good Fast cleanse. Nordholt leads an online-coached session every season, supplying members with a bevy of tools to give their systems a break from everyday toxins, and nutritionally hit the “reset” button. Beginning February 1, members will receive everything from shopping lists and detailed menus to video fitness guides and cooking tips. “It’s definitely a commitment. You have to be willing to do the work, which means preparing all your own meals from scratch, and fitting it into your busy schedule. But when you do take the plunge, by day five or six you’re already seeing and feeling results, so you get in the groove quickly. It’s empowering to take charge of your own well-being,” says Nordholt. Past participants have reached all levels of success, from significant weight loss to kicking the coffee habit, and even reversing Type 2 diabetes. If you’re looking to focus on incorporating more raw foods into your diet, Gena Hamshaw can help. A certified clinical nutritionist and high-raw-foods vegan, Hamshaw is joining forces with Spark!Wellness for their upcoming January cleanse, translating her expertise to a fast and effective 10-day vegan cleanse. Setting the wheels in motion for long-term change, Hemshaw’s “Level 3” plan incorporates 50 percent raw foods while excluding toxins and allergens. Including pre-cleanse tips to help make the shift away from addictions and allergens pain-free, the short and sweet plan provides flexible meal plans, easy recipes, and troubleshooting advice. The program, which starts January 18, is designed as a gentle introduction to plant-based foods, requiring no extra kitchen equipment despite its high-raw content. No matter which approach taken in the new year, the formula remains true and constant—healthy food, more exercise, and a positive outlook. “The biggest excuse we all use for not taking impeccable care of ourselves is ‘I don’t have time.’ It’s a complete myth. When we make the time for self-care, we are actually freed of that excuse forever,” says Nordholt. Whether you join an online program or simply make an effort to have a little more kale in your life, let 2010 be your year for health and happiness. Check out some of our favorite cleansing recipes!

KATHY FRESTONS’ TOP 10 GOALS FOR 2010,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/kathy-frestons-top-10-goals-for-2010,"DECEMBER 30, 2009","With the end of 2009 looming near, all holiday hoopla fades away and we’re left with an opportunity to reexamine our accomplishments and goals. Some people panic when they realize so much time has passed, and resolve to stop doing this or stop doing that. Fortunately, it isn’t all or nothing when it comes to your health and happiness, so forget about shaky resolutions. The beginning of a new year is just another opportunity to get in touch with what really matters. Conduct a personal inventory of the year. Ask yourself where you didn’t quite rise to the occasion and determine what you need to do better or differently in the year to come. Pat yourself on the back. Recognize where and how you’ve grown and take stock of the person you have become. Undoubtedly, it hasn’t always been easy, so allow yourself a moment of pride. Try the mini-meditation. Haven’t tried meditation? Begin by simply taking 10 breaths with your eyes closed every day. (I call this a mini-meditation.) Inhale on the words “I am,” and exhale on an affirmation such as “peace” or “healing.” If you are already meditating, sit with someone else and help her get started. Join in the holiday fun without destroying your health. Instead of indulging in cookies and cakes at office or holiday parties, bring treats to share that are sweetened with agave nectar or brown rice syrup. Your friends will love the idea of indulging without feeling guilty. Share the love. Every time you snuggle your animal companion, look into his or her eyes and say, “May you hold the place for all animals to be loved and cherished like you. May all animals enjoy the comfort and peace that you know.” Upgrade your eating. If you still eat dairy, consider trying vegan cheese and soy creamer. If you overeat processed foods, lean into more whole foods such as beans and grains. Eat vegetables only occasionally? Try tossing frozen organic broccoli or spinach into a smoothie. You won’t even taste them! (And you’ll get a good dose of greens.) Think positively. Sit in a holy place (a church, temple, or special spot in the woods), close your eyes, and ask that a miracle take place for less fortunate people and animals. Then offer yourself to be used in the service of that miracle’s unfolding. Lighten up. Get to know what Jung called your “shadow,” or the parts of yourself that have been shamed or disowned. As you come to accept and heal yourself, that healing will ripple out into the world and create a more peaceful planet. Break bread. Invite an omnivorous friend over for a festive vegan meal with no strings or expectations attached. Your generosity and spirit will infuse the food with love, allowing him to take in the message of kindness. Let go and celebrate. Feel in your heart that something truly monumental is on the way. And so it is! "

These fish can grow to be 19 feet long and 1,000 pounds, and fewer than 500 still exist. They have not successfully reproduced for 35 years. A hydroelectric dam in Montana is to blame, altering the high water flows in the Kootenai River that triggered the fish to swim upstream and spawn. Biologists say the fish could be extinct within 15 years if nothing changes. Fishery officials plan to dump more water into the dam to fix this problem. "
EARLY MAN ATE GRAIN,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/early-man-ate-grain,"DECEMBER 28, 2009","Humans have been eating a diet of grains, fruits, and vegetables for more than 100,000 years, says new research from the University of Calgary. Archeologists from Canada recently came to this conclusion after uncovering stone tools at a dig site in southeastern Africa. Previous to the discovery, scientists believed homo sapiens only ate grain for the past 20,000 years. This find suggests that the diet of early man was far more diverse—and the digestive system far more advanced—than formerly believed. Research suggests that primitive grain dishes consumed by humans included flours, beverages, and porridges. "

The four rhinos, possibly half of the world’s population, live in the Dvur Kralove zoo. The zoo hopes they will successfully mate when they return to the wild, where they will be protected from poachers, who kill the animals for their horns. Although critics say this is a dangerous plan because the animals are not equipped to live in the wild, zookeepers say their genetic memory will help them adapt and survive. "

HSUS praised the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for taking action to stop downed cattle from entering the food supply. It also commended the Environmental Protection Agency for examining the greenhouse gas emissions from factory farms. However, HSUS condemned the administration’s decision to take gray wolves in Idaho and Montana off the endangered species list, making the animals vulnerable to hunting. HSUS also criticized the USDA for financially supporting the meat industry without requiring any reforms that would benefit animals. Overall, HSUS says Obama is doing a better job with animal welfare than the previous administration, but there is still a great deal of room for improvement. "

Lapin said she has appealed to the US Department of Agriculture to institute a downer pig law, similar to the one recently passed for downer cows. "
UK REPORT SAYS GO VEG,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/uk-report-says-go-veg,"DECEMBER 13, 2009","UK citizens are urged to reduce meat and dairy consumption to promote their own health and the health of the planet, according to official recommendations announced December 11. The Sustainable Development Commission, an independent organization that informs government policy in the UK, released a report that advocates eating less meat, dairy, and processed foods. The report acknowledges such a switch will impact the UK’s livestock and food-manufacturing industries. However, the benefits of this dietary change include reduced incidence of heart disease, cancer, and animal-borne disease, as well as less greenhouse gas emissions and lower food prices. "
AUSTRALIA CONDEMNS WHALING,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/australia-condemns-whaling,"DECEMBER 13, 2009","Last week, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd took a firm stance against Japanese whaling programs, threatening to pursue international legal action against the nation’s government. While commercial whaling is internationally banned, whale hunts are permitted for scientific research purposes, and extra meat is then sold for consumption. Rudd told Australia’s Fairfax Radio Network that researchers from Australia and New Zealand will challenge the research exception by sending a team of scientists to the Arctic to prove that whales can be studied without being killed. Japanese whaling season begins this month, and anti-whaling activists from the Sea Shepherd Conversation Society have already set sail for the Arctic. "
THE TOXIC TIE BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/the-toxic-tie-between-agriculture-and-climate-change,"DECEMBER 13, 2009","The Copenhagen Climate Conference is now in full swing, and so far a major point of contention is deciding how developed nations should help less-developed countries adjust to climate change. The United Nations (UN) reported in September that poorer countries would require $500–600 billion per year for the next ten years to combat climate change while maintaining their economic growth. Responding to this need, this week EU leaders pledged $22 billion per year to assist developing countries. Developing nations also want stricter international commitments to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs). More than 100 of the 192 nations at the conference, including African nations and small island nations that could literally disappear due to rising sea levels, want an agreement that limits global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industry levels. This means developed nations must reduce their carbon emissions by 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. However, developed nations seem reluctant to accept such binding targets; although the EU is encouraging developed nations to pledge a 25–40 percent reduction of GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2020, the US indicated it would only cut emissions by 17-20 percent below 2005 levels. As the largest contributors of global GHGs, developed nations are responsible for the consequences of climate change that affect the rest of the world. Developing nations emit the least GHGs, but stand to lose the most from global warming. Africa contributes just four percent of the world’s total GHG emissions, but climate change is already affecting the region, especially its agriculture. Developing nations rely on agriculture for their livelihood, and this industry is sensitive to even small temperature changes. East Africa is currently facing one of its worst droughts in decades, which has significantly reduced crops, threatening 23 million people with starvation. A study from the University of California, Berkeley, goes as far to suggest global warming will increase the risk of civil war in Africa, because higher temperatures reduce food yields, which increases poverty and civil unrest. Earlier this year, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) released a report urging nations at the Copenhagen Climate Conference to include agriculture in its negotiations, because agriculture—including subsidiary effects like deforestation—accounts for more than one third of global GHG emissions. Agricultural emissions in developing nations are increasing, but these countries also have the most potential to limit farming emissions by switching to sustainable practices. The FAO concludes that international emissions targets will only be reached once the world reduces farming emissions without harming food security or economic development.

In 2006, the FAO reported that 18 percent of the world’s human-induced GHG emissions came from animal agriculture. According to former Vice President Al Gore, “The growing meat intensity of diets around the world is one of the issues connected to this global crisis—not only because of the CO2 involved, but also because of the water consumed in the process.” The Humane Society of the United States released a report recently highlighting how animal agriculture is also an inefficient use of land. If humans ate the grain used to feed the livestock that is raised for meat, more people could be fed by using the same amount of land. Less land use means less deforestation and less carbon released into the atmosphere. It follows that reducing meat production, and therefore livestock production, would address climate change and the world food shortage in one fell swoop, and allow developing nations to maintain economic growth while reducing GHG emissions.

MAXIMIZING YOUR CHARITABLE DONATIONS,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/maximizing-your-charitable-donations,"DECEMBER 12, 2009","This time of year is a great opportunity to give generously to nonprofits. Unfortunately, a down economy makes it tough to donate to charity, but it is also the time when such groups need the most support. If you plan to give the gift of cash this holiday season, here are some ideas to guarantee the charity of your choice gets the most bang from your buck. Decide which issues are most important to you, and donate accordingly. If it’s promoting vegetarianism, groups whose mission is to protect endangered species or prevent oil drilling in Alaska (while both worthy causes!) might not be the best choices. Neither World Wildlife Fund nor the Sierra Club advocates vegetarianism, and they do not condemn hunting. On the other hand, Global Hunger Alliance addresses the animal-agriculture connection to world poverty, promoting a vegan diet as they work to help the world’s less fortunate. Read over the organization’s website with a critical eye. Find out exactly what it does and see how effectively it uses its budget. Some smaller groups do a tremendous amount of outreach without paid staff, putting every dollar to work directly. National organization Mercy for Animals clearly states what it accomplishes with the support of charitable donations on its website. The World Society for the Protection of Animals USA puts 75 percent of its donations toward animal protection and 21 percent toward fundraising. Does the group show a strong commitment to a few key campaigns, or does it spread itself too thin? Large organizations like the Humane Society of the United States and PETA have the budgets to focus on a variety of different campaigns, but smaller groups may not. The Animal Protection and Rescue League effectively worked against foie gras because it concentrated on that issue, rather than on many different campaigns. Reward pioneering groups as well as the organizations that follow in their footsteps. People’s Grocery—a food justice organization with urban gardens and a mobile market—makes healthy, affordable food available to low-income people, and its model inspired similar work in other cities. Compassion Over Killing and Mercy for Animals also inspired other grassroots animal organizations with its innovative tactics such as open rescues, feed-ins, restaurant outreach, and showing factory-farming footage on busy city streets. Before making your next donation, check with your employer to see if it has a matching gift program. Many big companies will match employees’ donations to any nonprofit, doubling your impact. Visit Humane Seal to see whether an organization conducts animal tests and to find cruelty-free charities, and avoid giving to groups that spend resources fighting with like-minded organizations. Let’s spend the precious few dollars the vegetarian movement has to dismantle the meat industry—not each other. It is up to all of us to donate discerningly. Just like you wouldn’t spend $100 on a piece of clothing without trying it on, take the time to ensure your donation will have the greatest possible impact on the issues you care about the most. "
GENERAL MILLS LOWERS SUGAR,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/general-mills-lowers-sugar,"DECEMBER 11, 2009","General Mills will reduce the amount of sugar in the cereals it markets to children, the company announced December 9. It aims for all cereal advertised to kids under age 12, such as Trix, Cocoa Puffs, and Lucky Charms, to contain single-digit grams of sugar per serving. There is no specific timeline for when this will occur, but updated products will start to appear in 2010. Other food companies, including Post and Kellogs, recently took steps to make their cereals healthier by reducing sugar and increasing vitamins and fiber. The Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity reported in October that kid-friendly cereals are usually the least healthy cereals money can buy. "
ANIMAL TRANSPLANT BAN LIFTED,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/animal-transplant-ban-lifted,"DECEMBER 10, 2009","At the end of 2009, Australia will lift a five-year ban on animal-to-human transplants, according to the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). In 2004, the Australian government banned xenotransplantation—the transplanting of animal organs and cells into humans—citing concerns about potential health consequences. The ban will be lifted because subsequent research and scientific and technological advances indicate risks are low, NHMRC representatives confirmed on Thursday. Scientists in Australia and New Zealand have successfully used animal cells in humans to treat Type 1 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Xenotransplantation is already legal in more than 14 countries, including the US, Japan, and New Zealand. "
EU’S INHUMANE PIG TREATMENT,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/eus-inhumane-pig-treatment,"DECEMBER 10, 2009","European livestock farmers are illegally castrating pigs without anesthetic, according to a team of European scientists. Farmers castrate pigs to lower testosterone levels, which produces meat with more fat that doesn’t have a “boar taint” smell, and EU law states they are only allowed to castrate an animal without anesthetic if the pig is less than a week old. After seven days, a vet must carry out the procedure with anesthetic. However, researchers found that these rules are not always followed. In Spain, the most common castration method is surgery without anesthetic, which causes unnecessary suffering. This investigation is part of the PIGCAS project, which aims to gather information about pig castration to inform European legislation. The study was published in the most recent issue of Animal. "
POLAR BEAR MERCURY POISONING,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/polar-bear-mercury-poisoning,"DECEMBER 10, 2009","Global warming may be responsible for contaminating polar bears with high levels of mercury, according to new research from scientists at the University of Canterbury and the University of Michigan. Researchers examined polar bear specimens and data from the early 1900s, before dependence on fossil fuels rose. They found that polar bears primarily ate phytoplankton, microscopic plants that float on the surface of the ocean, and algae that live on sea ice. However, rising temperatures are causing ice caps to melt and are forcing polar bears to rely heavily on phytoplankton for food, which contains more mercury than algae. "
PERFECT HOLIDAY PREP,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/perfect-holiday-prep,"DECEMBER 10, 2009"," For a cozy night in before the madness of the holidays reaches maximum capacity, there’s nothing more satisfying than lounging fireside, nibbling on something delicious, and making personalized, eco-friendly gifts for friends and family. While frantic throngs of shoppers mob the mall, make your pre-holiday prep ever so civilized with these handy tips.   Fire It Up!
If the environmental concerns regarding fireplaces make your head ache more than breathing particulate matter does, you and other eco-conscious fire enthusiasts will be happy to know there are now myriad sustainable approaches to getting your flame on, including some that sidestep wood altogether.   Consider the Java-Log. Made from used, dried coffee grounds (waste from the coffee industry) and vegetable wax, Java-Logs burn as long or longer than wood logs and produce 87 percent less carbon monoxide. They also divert 20 million pounds of coffee grounds that would otherwise wind up in landfills each year. Java-Logs are described as having a mild, sweet scent, though for those hoping to sneak a little caffeine buzz into your fireside idyll, you’ll have to get it from another source—there are no caffeine emissions from these logs.   There are other sustainable fireplace options also made from reclaimed sources. CleanFlame logs are made entirely from wax-coated produce boxes, of which 600,000 tons are sent to landfills annually after use. Think of all that produce herbivores consume every year, and feel less guilty by using these box logs. Using CleanFlame logs helps stem that process, and they have the same burn time as traditional wood logs and can be used in patio fireplaces.   Goodwood fire logs, made with woodchips and sawdust waste from various sources, claim to create up to 50 percent fewer emissions with no added binders, as the natural resins in the wood bind the log through the compression process. These logs burn much cleaner than those made with petroleum-based binders and are considered carbon neutral. Contributing to global warming is the last thing you need to think about when relaxing by the fireplace.   Holy Craft!
It’s likely that seasoned crafters have a glue gun in their hip holster, but what they may not know is most glue guns and sticks contain animal by-products and chemicals galore. Fortunately, there is an alternative for the eco-friendly glue-gun slinger. Amazing EcoGlue,vegan glue created by the same folks who brought us Amazing GOOP, is a super-strength earth-friendly power glue. EcoGlue is great for getting your craft on, acting as a durable adhesive for wood, stone, metal, tile, fabric, and even glass. It’s 100-percent animal derivative-free, contains less than one percent volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is water-based, water resistant, and non-toxic, and is packaged completely in recycled products. The drawback? The watery consistency means that users have to wait while the glue dries to ensure a bond and is best suited for gluing on horizontal surfaces.   Need an acrylic yarn that is eco-friendly, wool-free, and still soft? Red Heart Eco Ways is a 70-percent acrylic and 30-percent recycled polyester yarn sourced from used plastics. Even the paper label is printed on recycled paper. Retailing for the same price as an average skein of yarn, it’s soft, durable, and even better after soaking the garment in water and line drying. Not as soft as cotton yarns, Eco Ways is perfect for throw blankets, baby doll clothes and crocheting.   While more pricey than recycled cotton yarns ($6.99 a skein), when you purchase Nature’s Choice Organic Cotton Yarn, you can be assured that it is grown and spun without the use of pesticides, herbicides or other chemicals. Recycled cotton yarns may use fabrics that would otherwise be discarded, but the cotton is typically grown using pesticides and heavily dyed with chemicals. Nature’s Choice dyes are certified according to the Global Organic Textile Standard by the Institute of Marketecology. This yarn is perfect for cozy scarves and mittens and well worth the extra cost.   Not a knitter and wondering what to make? Give an extra eco-friendly gift by customizing a canvas tote for someone who always “forgets” to bring reusable bags to the grocery store. With a super-chic design, there’s no excuse for leaving a tote at home. Many dollar stores carry the basic canvas tote, and then it’s just a matter of finding a stencil. There are loads of websites that offer stencil ideas (think Banksy, not Martha), so finding one to fit the recipient’s personality is a snap (though veg-oriented slogans are always in fashion). Pick up a brush and a small bottle of non-toxic fabric paint, such as Jacquard Textile Colors, and voilà! You have a totally original and practical accessory you can give away with pride.

TAL RONNEN ON EXTRA,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/tal-ronnen-on-extra,"DECEMBER 9, 2009","This week, entertainment news program Extra caught up with veg chef Tal Ronnen to discuss plant-based cuisine and address vegan diet myths. The program featured Ronnen during its “life changers” segment with Extra correspondent Kathy Freston, praising Ronnen’s approach to hearty meat-free fare and spotlighting his new cookbook—and VN’s 2009 Book of the Year—The Conscious Cook. The compassionate chef debunked three common plant-based diet myths: vegan food is tasteless, expensive, and isn’t filling. Ronnen, who Oprah recently named her favorite vegan chef, explained that veg food is rich in flavor and protein, and that meat is a more expensive grocery-store purchase than fruits and vegetables.

SCHOOLS’ POOR MEAT STANDARDS,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/schools-poor-meat-standards,"DECEMBER 9, 2009","Meat used in school lunches is not as rigorously tested for pathogens as meat served in many fast-food restaurants, according to a recent investigation by USA Today. Although the Agricultural Marketing Service says their inspection process for school lunch meat is stricter than the requirements for meat sold to the general public, many fast-food chains, including KFC and Jack in the Box, would consistently reject the meat that schoolchildren end up eating. J. Glenn Morris, director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida, says these findings are problematic because there is no guarantee cafeteria workers will cook meat thoroughly enough to kill bacteria, and children are more susceptible to food-borne pathogens. This report is one more reason why Meatless Mondays are a good idea. "
CLIMATE ENDANGERS SPECIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/climate-endangers-species,"DECEMBER 9, 2009","Five of the 10 most endangered species in the world are directly threatened by climate change, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The environmental-conservation organization released its annual list of threatened species, entitled “10 to Watch in 2010,” on December 2, stating many animals are facing increasing threats from habitat loss, poaching, and global warming. Tigers, of which there are only an estimated 3,200 left in the wild, are threatened by deforestation, poaching, and rising sea levels attributable to climate change. Polar bears could be extinct within the century if Arctic temperatures continue to rise, according to the WWF. Other species adversely affected by climate change include the Pacific walrus, Magellanic penguins, and the leatherback turtle. "
GHGS ENDANGER HEALTH,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/ghgs-endanger-health,"DECEMBER 8, 2009","Greenhouse-gas emissions (GHGs) are threatening public health in the US and must be controlled by government regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced on December 7. The EPA analyzed scientific evidence and found that GHG-induced climate change means hotter, longer heat waves that adversely affect the sick, poor, and elderly. GHGs also contribute to pollution that increases asthma and other respiratory diseases. According to EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson, “These long-overdue findings cement 2009’s place in history as the year when the US government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse-gas pollution.” In 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that GHGs may by regulated by the Clean Air Act, allowing the EPA to impose standards for light-duty vehicles that could save 1.8 billion barrels of oil over the lifespan of a car.

CLIMATE CHANGE ANGERS FISH,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/climate-change-angers-fish,"DECEMBER 7, 2009","Environmentalists aren’t the only group enraged by rising global temperatures; climate change is linked to increased fish aggression, according to researchers from the University of New South Wales. Scientists analyzed how the behavior of young reef fish changed according to the temperature of their surroundings. They found fish acted more boldly in warmer water, suggesting a slight increase in temperature could make fish up to 30 times more aggressive. According to study leader Dr. Peter Biro, this correlation could also apply to more dangerous species: “I would imagine that it might also affect sharks…we think it is linked to the metabolism of the fishes—it increases their need to feed.” This research is published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

PLANT GENE SIZE,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/plant-gene-size,"DECEMBER 7, 2009","Scientists have successfully manipulated a naturally occurring growth gene in seeds to produce larger crops, according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Researchers from the John Innes Center in the UK and the University of Freiburg in Gemany identified the gene in an experiment using small flowering plants, finding that it naturally occurs in all plants but is not always activated during growth. By altering the growth signals in seeds, scientists are able to produce seeds three times larger in size and weight. The project is the first of its kind to yield reciprocal effects on seed size, and scientists say it could help solve world hunger and food supply problems. "
RABBIT’S MILK MEDICINE,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/rabbits-milk-medicine,"DECEMBER 6, 2009","Researchers at a Dutch biotech firm have developed a drug made by extracting a milk protein from genetically-engineered rabbits. The drug, dubbed “Rhucin,” was created to treat hereditary angioedema, a potentially fatal condition caused by deficient levels of C1 inhibitors. Such therapeutic proteins cannot be synthetically engineered, which is why scientists modified rabbits to carry human C1 inhibitors. Representatives from Pharming Group submitted Rhucin to the European Medical Agency—the EU’s drug safety group—for market approval. If approved, the company will begin milking more than 1,000 rabbits to produce the protein. The EU won’t deliberate on the drug until later next year, and it has not yet been submitted for commercial approval in the US. "

OBESITY AND LIFE SPAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/obesity-and-life-span,"DECEMBER 6, 2009","Rising obesity levels will prevent any gain in US life expectancy that may have occurred because of reduced smoking levels, according to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers analyzed national survey data and discovered smoking rates decreased by 20 percent since 1994, while obesity increased by 48 percent. Scientists estimate that by 2020, reduced smoking rates will increase the average 18-year-old’s life expectancy by 0.31 years, but increased obesity will lower life expectancy by 1.02 years. The study’s lead author clarifies that life expectancy will not decline, but it could have increased significantly if obesity wasn’t a factor. Smoking and obesity both increase the risk of heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the US. "
DILLINGER’S LIAM WILSON,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/dillingers-liam-wilson,"DECEMBER 5, 2009","If you asked Liam Wilson 10 years ago what his post-college plans were, chances are they didn’t include leaving school early, joining an up-and-coming band, and starting a new life playing international shows as part of The Dillinger Escape Plan (DEP). After the supposedly cursed band’s former bass player was permanently injured in a car accident, a series of fateful events brought Wilson, a fan, to audition for the group. “The rest, as they say, is history,” he says. Since his start, DEP has released four studio albums, with their latest due this March. On a short break before the US and European tours begins, Wilson chatted with VN about his top three passions—music, veganism, and Bikram yoga. VegNews: You’re a Philadelphia local, born and raised. What are your favorite veg stops?
Liam Wilson: There’s a natural food market called Essene, and another restaurant called MiLah. Oh, and Kaffa Crossing, which is Ethiopian food. In the last 10 years, there’s really been a huge vegan and vegetarian push here. Whereas in New York it’s a little bit more polarized—it’s either vegan spots, or not-vegan spots. I think Philadelphia is a little more integrated, where almost every bar menu is one-third vegetarian or vegan next to other typical fare. VN: What sparked your transition to veganism?
LW: I was a senior in high school, and a really good friend of mine was vegan. I didn’t realize he was veg, I just really dug his non-political attitude about it. That was [my] New Year’s resolution. I read Diet for a New America within the first two weeks of that year, and I realized all the reasons I was suggesting to go vegetarian were the same everybody else goes vegan. My initial gut reaction was to the animal-rights aspect of it. Within a few weeks to months, it became a bigger scope issue where I started thinking the environmental thing was important. VN: Do you have a favorite tour city?
LW: I have to be honest—half of what I love about touring is getting to other cities and Happy Cow-ing it through the day. I really like London and the UK for all the curries, Australia for the fruit, and San Francisco for Millennium and Café Gratitude. Between vegan restaurants and Bikram yoga studios, anywhere that has one or both I’m a fan of. VN: Then you keep a steady yoga practice on tour?
LW: Absolutely. I have a perverse goal to try to practice in more studios internationally than anyone else. I’ve been practicing [Bikram] about four years. It’s funny when I get to Vienna and they’re teaching in German. That’s what I like about Bikram, it’s the same poses. I don’t really understand what they’re saying, but I know the postures. VN: How difficult is it for you to eat on the road?
LW: Ten years ago, I’m sure it was a bigger pain for me than it is now. For me, the answer, ironically enough, even though it’s almost more complicated in every other way, is eating more raw. I’ll get a bag of spinach and eat it like potato chips. It might be harder to get a tofu steak, but to eat vegan, or even raw, you’re going to find that stuff almost anywhere. There are times it sucks, like when I was in Poland and was like, “Okay, I’m eating mushroom pierogies again.” Even there, you learn to pack some extra LÄRABARS in your bag and suck it up. It’s as hard as you want to make it. VN: On average, you tour nine months out of the year, which sounds exhausting. Do you see yourself slowing down at all?
LW: I’m still pretty energized. I’m turning 30 this December, and I don’t necessarily feel any slower. The more I move my diet away from processed vegan food and eat more raw, and the more Bikram I’ve been doing—I see everyone else in my band slowing down before I would. VN: What are your long-term goals for DEP and after?
LW: I can’t say this will always be my primary source of income, or that I’ll always work in the industry by being a player. Perhaps I’ll tech or tour manage for some other band. I’ve also considered opening a restaurant or café, or going to Bikram training. There are all kinds of things I have simmering on the back burner. Unless some real disaster comes in, which this band has certainly been prone to, I can’t imagine doing much more than this for at least another five to 10 years. "
ULTRAMAN RICH ROLL,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/ultraman-rich-roll,"DECEMBER 5, 2009","Appearing in the pages of Men’s Fitness, Rich Roll was deemed one of the world’s 25 most fit men in the world. A devoted husband, father, full-time lawyer, and personal coach, Roll recently completed his training for the 2009 Ultraman World Championships—a grueling race comprised of a 6.2-mile swim, a 261.4-mile bike ride, and a 52.4-mile run. “Fit” might be an understatement. An unwavering work ethic combined with Roll’s balanced, vegan diet helped Roll finish the November race in an impressive sixth place overall. While it seems like the superhero-like athlete wouldn’t have a moment to spare, he found a way to fit in some quality VN-time for a closer look at his successes, challenges, and upcoming projects. VegNews: Do you now consider yourself a professional athlete, or is practicing law still your “day job”?
Rich Roll: Although I have an array of very supportive product sponsors, to date I have never been paid by a sponsor or to compete. I am working towards a more professional approach to my mission, but I am currently very much an amateur despite the fact that I train a bit more than most, putting in an average of 25 hours weekly. I make my living as a full-time entertainment attorney, managing a boutique law firm I founded several years ago here in Los Angeles. VN: In your coaching, do you encourage clients to adopt a plant-based diet?
RR: I find that preaching is counter-productive and therefore I focus on simply sharing my personal experience—what has worked for me, what hasn’t, and why. I encourage experimentation with a plant-based whole food regime, but the extent of the encouragement often depends upon a client’s openness. I’m happy to say that I have played a small part in helping a variety of people transition away from animal-based foods. VN: What’s the most rewarding thing about your life as an athlete? The most challenging?
RR: What has been most rewarding is the unexpected response I have received. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have contacted me, sharing the intimate details of their health struggles and thanking me for the inspiration and the motivation to change. The most challenging is balancing the training regimen with not only my professional obligations, but my role as a husband and father of four children. It has forced me to become very organized and efficient in all my affairs, excising all non-essential distractions from my life. VN: How does veganism affect your training?
RR: What I find most striking is my ability to recover very rapidly between workouts. Despite a very heavy volume of training, my appetite does not spike, which I attribute to the high nutritional value of the foods I am eating. VN: What projects are you currently working on?
RR: My wife and I are finishing up the first edition of a self-published cookbook entitled Jai Seed, which will be available for purchase through my website this month. I am also working on a longer biographical/inspirational book, and I have a television project in development. It’s an inspirational reality-based program where I help others actualize their health, nutrition, and fitness goals. VN: Tell me about your company, Jai Ultra Multisport Training Camps, Retreats, Nutrition Products & Garments. Do you already have camps or are they coming soon?
RR: Prior to the births of our two daughters, my wife and I produced high-end yoga retreats in five-star international locations with well-known LA-based yoga teachers. This spring, we are re-launching as “Jai Ultra” and will be offering retreats and training camps that will entail plant-based nutrition, cooking, yoga, healing, and multi-sport training. My wife is also experienced in the garment industry and had a line of high-end women’s attire many years ago. With her experience, we are developing some simple, branded garments, including t-shirts, and running, cycling, and yoga sportswear, which we intend to slowly roll out by mid-2010. VN: What role does veg activism play in your life?
RR: Over the last year, I have begun to educate myself on issues ranging from factory farming to greenhouse gas emissions and animal rights. This is slowly translating into advocacy, including a video interview with PETA. I think this is a wonderful time—an unprecedented period in our history when people are more responsive than ever, ready to not only hear the message but willing to implement change. "
CHRISTMAS TREE TIPS FOR A GREENER HOLIDAY,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/christmas-tree-tips-for-a-greener-holiday,"DECEMBER 5, 2009","If you celebrate Christmas, whether for religious or cultural reasons, you’re probably starting to think about buying a Christmas tree. The cheapest and most eco-friendly option is to go without, but there is something about an indoor tree covered in beautiful lights and sparkly decorations that keep people coming back for more. With the holidays now in full swing, here are some ideas to make sure the tree you choose is right for your lifestyle. Traditional Trees
Cutting down a perfectly healthy tree just to satisfy the demands of a holiday tradition seems questionable. Is it wasteful and reckless to go around cutting down trees at Christmas? Not necessarily. Christmas trees don’t come from evergreen forests; they are grown like any other crop. According to the National Christmas Tree Association, between one and three trees are planted to replace every one cut. It takes an average of seven years for trees to mature, and while growing they take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Buy from a local, organic tree farm to reduce your carbon footprint and avoid any pesticide residue. Frightening Fakes
Artificial trees are sometimes considered a more eco-friendly option than real trees because they can be reused. While it is true that faux firs eliminate the need to buy new trees year after year, it’s debatable whether their convenience outweighs the ecological detriment they cause. Artificial trees damage the environment at every step of their production. The majority of fake trees are made from petroleum-based PVC, a non-renewable resource. Since all artificial trees will eventually be thrown out at some point, the PVC will inevitable release chemicals into the environment. Pocket-sized Décor
For apartment dwellers, it’s not always possible to squeeze in a lush Douglas fir. But even if you live in a small space, you don’t have to go treeless. If you don’t want to cut down a tree, try a live tree instead. They are usually smaller than traditional trees, and after the holidays you can find the perfect spot to plant it outside. Rosemary bushes are another alternative. Readily available in home-improvement and garden stores, these live, cone-shaped bushes have the look and feel of traditional trees, but in a much smaller size. They are a perfect way to have holiday cheer and your entire year’s worth of rosemary in one fell swoop. The Season of Recycling
A tree’s usefulness needn’t come to a screeching halt on December 26. Many cities offer tree-recycling programs to make sure trees are not dumped illegally. They can also be transformed into garden mulch or firewood for your woodstove. At the very least, all-natural trees are biodegradable, and their nutrients benefit the soil as they decompose. "
TOWN PASSES GREEN INITIATIVE,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/town-passes-green-initiative,"DECEMBER 4, 2009","Signal Mountain, a small town in Tennessee, recently approved a Green Food Resolution, promising to rely more on locally-grown organic food with a greater emphasis on plant-based diets. The Signal Mountain Council will expand healthy food options by supporting local farmers’ markets, community gardens, and community-supported agriculture programs. The resolution is part of Farm Sanctuary’s Green Food Resolutions Campaign, which appeals to city governments to adopt legislation that reduces meat consumption and commits to more sustainable living practices. Chicago and New York City have proposed similar legislation, but Signal Mountain is the first community to take such decisive action. "
FDA WARNS TYSON FOODS PLANT,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/fda-warns-tyson-foods-plant,"DECEMBER 3, 2009","This week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) publicly released a warning letter it issued last month to Tyson Foods. FDA inspectors discovered unsanitary factory conditions during a routine observation at Tyson’s plant in Forth Worth, Texas. The plant, which produces soups containing fish, shrimp, and crabmeat, was storing meat at dangerously high temperatures that could generate bacteria and toxins. The FDA also reprimanded the company because it did not document bacterial growth. Representatives from Tyson said the unsanitary meat observed by the FDA was not used in company products, but the FDA disagrees. The company has since revised its temperature control plan. "
"LESS PROTEIN, LONGER LIFE?",https://vegnews.com/2009/12/less-protein-longer-life,"DECEMBER 3, 2009","Avoiding an amino acid prevalent in meat and fish could be the key to longevity, a new study suggests. Previous research indicated that severe calorie restriction leads to a long life, but researchers at University College London achieved a similar longevity effect in fruit flies by reducing methionine levels in an otherwise normal calorie diet. Methionine is an amino acid common in meat, fish, and some nuts. Study co-author Matthew Piper says it is too early to say whether a dietary change could benefit humans, but the study suggests it is the type of protein, not the amount, that is important to health. The study was published December 2 in Nature. "
STORING FAT GENES,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/storing-fat-genes,"DECEMBER 3, 2009","Eating a steady diet of high-fat and high-sugar foods makes it even harder for humans to convert food into energy, causing the body to store more fat, according to a new research report released by The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. The study shows that high-fat and high-sugar foods stimulate the kappa opioid receptor, which causes the body to store more fat than usual. Scientists believe this research could help stop worldwide obesity problems, because it gives researchers a new drug target for developing preventative therapies. One preventative therapy that doesn’t require drugs is eating a varied, veg diet. Doughnuts—vegan, of course—are a great occasional treat, they shouldn’t be the cornerstone of any diet! "
ANIMALS GET LEGAL STATUS,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/animals-get-legal-status,"DECEMBER 2, 2009","Europe has legally recognized animals as sentient beings according to the Lisbon Treaty, which went into effect December 1. Article 13 of the treaty states, “…the Union and the Member States shall, since animals are sentient beings, pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals…” Compassion in World Farming, an animal-welfare organization, says this is a positive precedent that will help activists negotiate for improved animal-welfare legislation. The treaty, originally signed in 2007 by all 27 EU members, addresses modern social, economic, and political changes, and is designed to “[take] Europe into the 21st century.” "
BILL MAHER TAKES ON IHOP,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/bill-maher-takes-on-ihop,"DECEMBER 2, 2009","This week, comedian Bill Maher appears in a Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) public service announcement criticizing the International House of Pancakes (IHOP) for using egg suppliers that confine hens to battery cages. Maher urges IHOP to switch to cage-free egg suppliers and points to other major restaurant chains that have done so, including Denny’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s. In October, HSUS filed suit against IHOP, accusing the pancake chain of lying to consumers about using “cruelty-free” eggs. With the lawsuit, HSUS also launched a campaign urging IHOP to switch over to cage-free eggs. "
BACTERIA RAMPANT IN CHICKEN,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/bacteria-rampant-in-chicken,"DECEMBER 2, 2009","More than two-thirds of the chicken in grocery stores contains antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can cause illness and even death, according to a report from Consumer Reports magazine. The report analyzed 382 fresh, whole broiler chickens bought in more than 100 stores from 22 states across the country. Sixty-two percent of the chickens contained campylobacter, 14 percent contained salmonella, and 9 percent contained both. These pathogens are the leading bacterial causes of foodborne illness and infect roughly 3.4 million people in the US each year. Chickens from Tyson and Foster Farms were the most infected; more than 80 percent of their samples contained at least one of the pathogens. "

VEGAN FOOD IS A THRIVING BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/vegan-food-is-a-thriving-billion-dollar-industry,"DECEMBER 2, 2009","The vegan industry is experiencing an unprecedented boom in business, especially during the holiday season. Savory centerpieces such as Field Roast and Tofurky are now satiating the appetites of omni and veggie diners while myriad mainstream establishments, ranging from Johnny Rockets to PF Chang’s, are grabbing a piece of the $2.8 million pie with veg-friendly menu offerings. The plant-based industry’s lucrativeness was recently spotlighted by Fox Business, in an interview with Annie Shannon—author of Betty Goes Vegan—and branding guru Bruce Turkel, who both talked about the increasing appeal and accessibility of vegan food. Turkel noted that it’s not just staunch cruelty-free advocates that are dining on plant-based fare, but the 23 million people who claim to have “vegetarian influenced” diets. "
IN VITRO PORK,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/in-vitro-pork,"DECEMBER 1, 2009","Scientists at Eindhoven University in Holland have successfully grown pork meat in a laboratory using cells taken from a live pig. The cultured meat, dubbed both “in vitro” and “vat-meat,” has garnered praise from animal-rights group PETA and world-hunger strategists at NASA as the future face of food. To create the cultures, scientists extracted, incubated, and molded muscle tissue taken from a live pig. The current product lacks the desired texture, but researchers are confident the cultures will be perfected through subsequent trials, estimating it may be available in grocery stores by 2014. "
VITASOY LEAVES US SHELVES,https://vegnews.com/2009/12/vitasoy-leaves-us-shelves,"DECEMBER 1, 2009","Vitasoy USA decided to stop distributing aseptic-packed soymilk in mainstream US markets this April. According to Vitasoy spokesperson Sue McGovern, the decision was difficult, as the company has been on shelves for 30 years but could no longer keep pace with competitors. Consumers, according to McGovern, increasingly want refrigerated soymilk, hence the decision to move away from its shelf-stable line. Vitasoy will continue to distribute different formulations of soymilk internationally, where it enjoys widespread popularity, and in US Asian-American markets as well as Canada. In the US, Vitasoy USA will shift strategic focus to its Nasoya and Azumaya brands. Last December, the company introduced Silken Style Creations, a tofu-based “dessert starter,” and it will launch another new product in January. "

HORMONE RUNOFF RESEARCH,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/hormone-runoff-research,"NOVEMBER 30, 2009","For years scientists have expressed concerns over the environmental impact of untreated animal waste running into rivers and waterways. New research from the University of Nebraska in Omaha now proposes that similar problems arise through blown feedlot dust. Their findings conclude that in some areas of the country, especially the Southwest, wind—not water—is the dominant carrier of hormone-laden waste pollutants. On factory farms, cows are routinely injected with hormones that pose pollutant risks when excreted into the environment, causing runoff in rivers and streams that are responsible for sex alterations in fish. Research is still being preformed to gauge the health consequences, long-term effects, and geographic scope of these wind-blown pollutants. "
SALTWATER EQUALS ENERGY,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/saltwater-equals-energy,"NOVEMBER 30, 2009","Norwegian power company Statkraft unveiled the world’s first osmotic power prototype last week, which uses saltwater to generate eco-friendly electricity. The new technology uses osmosis: a permeable membrane separates saltwater from freshwater, and the pressure of the freshwater diluting the saltwater moves a turbine that creates electricity. The small project will initially produce just four kilowatts of energy, but Statkraft hopes to build a full power plant by 2015 that can produce 25 megawatts. Proponents say this type of renewable, emissions-free energy is promising because it does not rely on weather, like wind or solar power, and it can be produced wherever saltwater and freshwater interact. "
ORGANIC FARMS CURB EMISSIONS,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/organic-farms-curb-emissions,"NOVEMBER 30, 2009","Transforming all conventional farms in the UK to organic farms would be equivalent to eliminating the carbon emissions from 1 million cars, according to a report from the Soil Association. The non-profit organization—the largest organic certifier in the UK—says the soil on an average organic farm has 28 percent more carbon than soil on a conventional farm. More carbon in the soil means less carbon in the atmosphere. The report also says a global switch to organic agriculture would reduce 11 percent of the world’s carbon emissions. Pete Smith, professor of Soils and Global Change at Aberdeen University, cautions that organic farms must use more land to match the productivity of conventional farms, which reduces the environmental benefits.

LOCAVORISM DEBUNKED,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/locavorism-debunked,"NOVEMBER 29, 2009","Buying locally farmed meat may not be an environmentally friendly action, and in some cases may leave a bigger carbon footprint than buying imported foods. New research from Dalhousie University, the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology, and Oregon-based environmental research organization Ecotrust challenges the recent local food movement. The three-year global study focuses on the life cycle of salmon production, but scientists say that the findings are applicable to other major food commodities as well. Research shows that modes of catching, feeding, and keeping salmon, along with the methods required to transport fresh fish, were more damaging to the environment than those used with frozen fish. "
FOOD STAMP FLUMMOX,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/food-stamp-flummox,"NOVEMBER 29, 2009","Many states are not effectively managing food stamp programs, according to a letter from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to state administrators. The USDA has found that food stamp programs, designed to supply food to low-income Americans, have not nearly met enrollment requirements in at least a dozen states. In 2007 only 18 states enrolled 70 percent or more of those eligible for government assistance. In Wyoming and California, fewer than 50 percent of those eligible enrolled in the program. "
ALARMING SUSHI STUDY,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/alarming-sushi-study,"NOVEMBER 29, 2009","Sushi eaters do not necessarily know what they are biting into, according to researchers from the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics at the American Museum of Natural History. Researchers used DNA barcoding to determine the exact species used in tuna dishes from 31 different sushi restaurants in New York and Colorado. They determined that 22 of the 68 samples were bluefin tuna, an endangered species, although only eight of the samples were labeled as such by the restaurant. Five samples sold as white tuna turned out to be escolar, a fish banned in Japan and Italy because it causes stomach problems. The report further states that the rising demand for sushi is seriously threatening tuna species. "

JOB HUNTING WITH A CONSCIENCE,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/job-hunting-with-a-conscience,"NOVEMBER 28, 2009","Nowadays, landing a new job is tough enough, much less finding a company that’s in line with your ideals. But if you don’t want to compromise your conscientious lifestyle during the workweek, more and more workplaces are shaping up to attract the best possible talent. From veg-friendly perks to reduced carbon footprints, businesses big and small are offering their employees more than just a paycheck. Ask Around
Don’t underestimate the power of networking, and start with your own social circle. Finding out which friends love their jobs and why can be a good way to start looking for more progressive companies. You can also try looking at the products and services you already know and enjoy; companies producing veg-friendly products may be more likely to have a green work environment. The non-profit organization Green America publishes the National Green Pages, which contains a list of businesses that have pledged to operate in a socially responsible manner. Once you’ve narrowed down your list of companies, call for an informational interview to find out about the workplace culture before you even apply for a job. Employee Perks
How a company treats its employees is a good indicator for how it treats the rest of the planet. More and more companies are finding that they must appeal to their employees’ social values in order to attract and hire the best of the best. Clif Bar offers it workers all the energy bars they can eat plus an on-site gym to burn them off, as well as $500 toward the purchase of a commuter bike. Google will match employee charitable donations of up to $3000 per year, and it has onsite fitness facilities and massage therapy to promote health and wellbeing. Getting Greener
For some companies, green is more than just a buzzword. They’ve discovered that corporate success does not conflict with ethical living, and green can be good for the bottom line. Newsweek named Hewlett-Packard the greenest large corporation in the US because of its strong efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Dell came in a close second—its headquarters use 100 percent renewable energy. Smaller companies are also doing their part. Nature’s Path Organic Foods aims to reduce carbon emissions and produce zero waste, and it offers $1000 to employees who purchase an eco-friendly vehicle. Non-profit Notes
All non-profits are not created equal when you are looking to save the world. If you want to bring your ethics to work with you, it may seem natural to choose a non-profit for your employer, but they aren’t all necessarily supportive of their employees. Do your research and talk to members of the organization to make sure it’s a good fit. While a non-profit might not have the same perks as a major conglomerate, the rewarding work is incentive enough if you still get to work in a friendly and ethical environment.

VEG-FRIENDLY COLLEGES,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/veg-friendly-colleges,"NOVEMBER 27, 2009","This week, PETA2, the youth branch of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, released its annual list of veg-friendly colleges. Top honors for the 2009 Most Vegetarian Friendly Colleges went to Wesleyan University and Oberlin College, who placed first and second, respectively. At Wesleyan students dine on veggie chicken red curry, three-mushroom vegan ragu pasta, and barbecue seitan, while students at Oberlin indulge in tempeh and wild mushroom fricassee, vegetable stew, seitan pepper steak, and barbecue tofu pizza. Eligibility was contingent on recipes and photos of vegetarian and vegan meal options in college cafeterias. A formal list of 48 competitors was compiled and students were encouraged to vote for their university to earn a spot in the top 10. A similar list was also compiled for Canadian colleges, with McMaster University coming in first place. "
SEA LEVELS THREATEN ECONOMY,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/sea-levels-threaten-economy,"NOVEMBER 26, 2009","Rising sea levels attributable to climate change will have severe consequences for the US economy, according to a report released November 23 by the World Wildlife Fund and insurer Allianz SE. Currently, a major storm surge puts $1.4 trillion worth of property at risk in the US. By 2050, anticipated global sea levels rising by 0.5 meters will push that amount to $7.4 trillion. The most at-risk cities in this scenario are Miami, New York, and New Orleans. The report urges President Obama to attend the Copenhagen Climate Conference to circumvent this threat to the domestic economy. Obama announced Wednesday that he will attend the international conference on December 9. "
EXERCISE AND APPETITE,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/exercise-and-appetite,"NOVEMBER 26, 2009","How exercise affects one’s appetite could determine whether or not they lose weight successfully, according to new research. Scientists examined 58 overweight men and women as they completed a 12-week exercise program, concluding that exercise increased the participants’ pre-meal appetite. However, the exercisers were also more satisfied by their morning meal when compared to their sedentary lifestyle behavior before the study. Researchers say this study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, could explain why some people succeed at weight loss where others fail. Even if exercise doesn’t melt away pounds, it still improves heart health and lowers cholesterol and blood pressure. "

BUY NOTHING DAY,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/buy-nothing-day,"NOVEMBER 25, 2009","Tomorrow, Adbusters Media Foundation is promoting its Buy Nothing Day campaign to reduce consumption on Black Friday in North America. The media group is also promoting Buy Nothing Day abroad on November 28. Along with halting consumerism for the day, Adbusters is also encouraging people to shut off electricity and nonessential appliances and electronics—including cell phones and computers—and to abstain from driving vehicles. The idea behind the 24-hour consumption protest is to highlight how compulsory shopping for nonessentials has become and how dependent modern societies are on unsustainable resources. "
STUDY TELLS UK TO GO VEG,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/study-tells-uk-to-go-veg,"NOVEMBER 25, 2009","Researchers say UK citizens should consume less meat to save lives and the planet. In a report released in The Lancet medical journal, scientists suggest reducing the country’s meat consumption by 30 percent. Reducing livestock production, along with other green initiatives, would help the agricultural industry reach its proposed emissions reduction targets and allow the UK to reduce its carbon emissions 50 percent by 2030. Lowering the public’s intake of saturated animal fat would prevent 18,000 fatal heart attacks per year, a 17 percent reduction. However, Kenneth Cassman from the University of Nebraska argues that reducing meat consumption in rich countries will not effectively address global trends because meat demand is increasing in developing nations. "
CLIMATE CHANGE INCITES WAR,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/climate-change-incites-war,"NOVEMBER 25, 2009","Global warming will increase the risk of civil wars in Africa, according to a study led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. Scientists found a strong historical link between higher-than-normal temperatures and outbreaks of civil violence in Africa. Using future temperature and precipitation estimates, scientists concluded that by 2030 the risk of civil war would increase by 55 percent. A large majority of people in Africa rely on agriculture to survive; small temperature changes would harm crops, increasing poverty and therefore the possibility of civil unrest. Researchers say this information should motivate African governments and international aid to help the continent adapt to climate change. "

SWEDISH PIG FARM ABUSE,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/swedish-pig-farm-abuse,"NOVEMBER 24, 2009","Pig farms in Sweden are violating the country’s animal-welfare laws, according to the Stockholm-based Animal Rights Alliance. The animal-rights group obtained undercover video footage from a Swedish pig farm that shows injured pigs with open sores, inadequate hay, and poor air conditions. Sveriges Radio verified the authenticity of the video, which also shows animals eating a dead pig that lay outside of their stalls. The farm’s owner, Lars Hulström, is the chairman of Swedish Meats, one of the largest food producers in Sweden. He says he will step down from his positions on various agricultural boards while an investigation takes place. Animal Rights Alliance says it has other incriminating evidence from pig farms across Sweden; it reported more than 90 farmers to the police for violating animal-welfare laws. "
FAUX TURKEY COMPARISON,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/faux-turkey-comparison,"NOVEMBER 24, 2009","A new study from the American Dietetic Association (ADA) stacks the nutritional value of six vegetarian holiday roasts side-by-side with turkey. The ADA found that all the meat alternatives were excellent sources of fiber and protein—the Tofurky roast actually offered more protein than turkey—and they were low in saturated fat and cholesterol. The only disadvantage to the faux fare was high sodium levels. The ADA also noted that the meat alternatives were much quicker and easier to prepare. Of the six veg roasts analyzed, four were vegan-friendly. "
OBESITY LINKED TO MS,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/obesity-linked-to-ms,"NOVEMBER 24, 2009","The Harvard School of Public Health recently released a 40-year study that links teenage obesity to MS. Researchers examined 238,000 women and discovered those who were obese during adolescence had twice the risk of developing MS compared to healthy 18-year-old women. Only adolescent body size mattered—the study found no correlation between childhood and adulthood body size. Almost 600 women were diagnosed with MS over the course of the study. High levels of vitamin D have been linked with a reduced risk of MS, and research shows that obesity is connected with low vitamin D levels in the body. "

Lewis expressed interest in creating an affordable line of cruelty-free shoes and accessories. Their rumored collaboration comes after the two animal lovers were seen together at a charity event in London. Lewis—X-Factor winner and PETA’s 2008 sexiest vegetarian—is adamant about avoiding leather and other animal products, and she once turned down a lucrative offer at luxury British retailer Harrods because it sells fur.

RITUAL ANIMAL SACRIFICE,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/ritual-animal-sacrifice,"NOVEMBER 23, 2009","Animal-rights activists are protesting the ritual sacrifice of more than 315,000 animals that are to be slaughtered today in a Nepalese village. Hindu priests estimate more than 15,000 buffalo and 300,000 birds, goats, and sheep will be slain at the religious festival, thought to be the largest ritual slaughter in the world. The festival is held every five years, and Hindu followers travel from across India and Nepal to attend. This year, outspoken animal-rights campaigners Maneka Gandhi and Brigitte Bardot have petitioned Nepal’s president to end the practice and criminalize ritual killing. While this year’s sacrifice shows no signs of being halted, animal-rights groups in Nepal are fighting to outlaw the ritual before the next festival. "
US EMISSIONS TARGETS,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/us-emissions-targets,"NOVEMBER 23, 2009","The US will have a specific carbon emissions reduction target before the Copenhagen Climate Conference begins on December 7, announced White House officials this week. The target will most likely mirror legislation passed in the House, which aims to reduce emissions 17 to 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. This is significantly less aggressive than goals set by other countries, which typically use 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions to create reduction targets. President Obama has not said whether he will join the more than 60 heads of state that have pledged to attend the conference, which is less than two weeks away. "
JOHN SALLEY FOR PCRM,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/john-salley-for-pcrm,"NOVEMBER 22, 2009","Renowned NBA player John Salley recently advocated for more veg-friendly school meals. During an event in Washington, DC, last week, Salley, along with representatives from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, asked Congress to reform the Child Nutrition Act to incorporate more fruits, vegetables, and healthy vegetarian food into school lunches. Speakers argued that improving school lunches is a worthy investment because it will lower US health care costs. “Students need more fruits and vegetables that will help them stay healthy, fit, and ready to learn,” said Salley. “That’s why it’s important for Congress to stay on top of its game by reforming the Child Nutrition Act.” "
RAINFOREST PROTECTION PLAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/rainforest-protection-plan,"NOVEMBER 22, 2009","On November 19, Prince Charles introduced an international fund designed to reduce the destruction of tropical rainforests. Nations such as Brazil and Indonesia rely on industries that tear down rainforests, such as logging, cattle farming, and palm oil production. Under this new plan, developed nations would invest in rainforest countries if they meet specific reduction targets, providing an incentive to protect this valuable natural resource. The US pledged $275 million to the effort, which aims to reduce annual deforestation rates by 25 percent in the next five years. The money is expected to come from world governments, but environmental groups are concerned these goals are unrealistic because funding is not yet secure. "
VEGGIES PREVENT CANCER,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/veggies-prevent-cancer,"NOVEMBER 22, 2009","Scientists from Maastricht University in the Netherlands found that compounds in plant-based foods may offer protection against colon and rectal cancer for overweight men and healthy women. The study examined the intake of flavonoids, catechins, and flavonol compounds in 120,852 men and women 55 to 69 years old. These compounds are found in foods such as berries, grapes, onions, kale, and apples. After 13 years, 1,444 men and 1,041 women developed colon or rectal cancer, and researchers found that while there was no correlation in causal factors such as smoking, eating habits, or physical activity, the observed compounds had specific protective effects for these two weight subgroups.

CONVERGE ROCK COMPASSION: A Q&A,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/converge-rock-compassion-a-qandampa,"NOVEMBER 22, 2009","At its most chaotic, their music is a loud, frantic, violent current of energy channeled through barking vocals and texturized guitar thrashing. Other tracks dial down the insanity—but never the intensity—to express a similar well of emotion with quiet, haunting sincerity. For almost 20 years, amidst line-up changes and watershed shifts in sound, Converge have thrilled audiences with their own brand of hardcore metal. Their latest album, Axe To Fall, has been met with glowing reviews. Pitchfork’s Cosmo Lee recently named Converge this generation’s Black Flag. While the band’s sound and history may mirror these hardcore punk idols, their compassionate lifestyle choices err more on the side of Black Sabbath’s Geezer Butler. Yes, like Butler these mosh-pit pleasers are meat-free rock stars. The four-piece powerhouse recently took a break from their current tour to talk with VegNews about their aural and animal-friendly history. VegNews: How did the band come to collectively adopt vegetarian lifestyles?
Nate Newton: I got the Smith’s “Meat is Murder” t-shirt in junior high school and realized I’d be a poser if I wore the shirt and ate a burger in front of the girl I liked. So it was to impress a mousy goth girl.
Kurt Ballou: When I was 18, I dated a girl who was vegetarian and she kind of forced me into it. So I started for a pretty insincere reason. But sometimes people do the right thing for the wrong reason. And I also believe that it’s hard to evaluate if something is right for you if it’s part of your daily routine. I think it took not eating meat every day for me to actually be aware enough to choose if it was something I wanted to do. When she dumped me, I went on a spiteful sausage-pizza binge, got really sick, and then went vegetarian the next day. I became vegan about a year after that. VN: How has the band’s sound evolved over the past two decades?
Jacob Bannon: Since we started so young, we’ve essentially had our musical progression as individuals documented within this band and within our songs. As to how we’ve evolved? Aside from improving as musicians and just finding our collective voice, I’m not really sure. That would be up to our listeners to decide.
KB: It’s always been important to us to not remain stagnant and to always push our music in new directions, both as a personal challenge, and to maintain a fulfilling artistic experience. VN: What are your go-to foods when on tour? What’s your favorite veg-friendly city to visit?
NN: You mean aside from Baked Lays and apples? I like going to Norfolk, Virg. to eat at Tortilla West.
KB: I just got an iPhone app called “VegOut” which knows your position and shows you restaurants near you with vegetarian options. It works really great! You read menus and reviews, decide where you want to go, then click on the address and get driving, walking, or public transport directions right on your phone. I usually just ride my bike! Right now, I’m way into eating in Chicago. They have a lot of vegan-friendly American and Mexican fare. I’m also heavily into the smoked tofu and seitan fajitas at the Cantina Los Caballitos in Philly. It takes three people to finish an order! VN: What are your favorite veg-friendly restaurants at home?
KB: For lunch I love New England Soup Factory and Boston Hotdog Company (BHC), both of which are a few minutes walk from my house in Salem. BHC has Field Roast sausages now! For dinner, I really like the raw pasta dishes at Chianti Café in Beverly, Mass. I’m also digging Red Lentil Vegetarian Restaurant in Watertown, Mass., and Peace O’ Pie in Allston, Mass. For desserts and Kombucha cocktails, I’m definitely going to Grezzo Restaurant in the North End of Boston. I also recently discovered a place called Udupi Bhavan in Lowell, Mass. They have this thing called a Chili Vada that is like an Indian jalapeno popper. Amazing! Photo courtesy of Matt Miller "

Stewart, whose daughter Alexis is vegetarian, welcomed a host of veg-friendly guests, including chef Jeremy Fox of California’s Ubuntu, Eating Animals author Jonathan Safran Foer, and Food, Inc., filmmaker Robert Kenner.

CAGED CHICKEN STUDIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/caged-chicken-studies,"NOVEMBER 19, 2009","A series of studies will examine how battery cages affect egg-laying chickens. One three-year study, led by Peter Skewes of Clemson University, will compare the behaviors of egg-laying chickens kept in different housing systems. Skewes says the research, funded by the US Department of Agriculture, will introduce scientific facts to the emotional debate between egg producers and animal-welfare activists. However, some animal-welfare groups fear this investigation will delay the ban of battery cages, which they say is a simple solution. Egg producers argue that chickens are healthier if they are kept inside. Other studies, funded by the American Egg Board and advised by Cargill and McDonald’s, will look at differences in environmental impact, food quality, and egg prices between caged and cage-free hens.

Their report found that more than a third of fish caught worldwide—36 percent—is used to feed farm animals such as chickens, pigs, and other fish. This unnatural diet threatens global fish stocks and contributes to climate change. Global fisheries use more fuel each year than 22 million cars just to catch fish and bring it to shore. The report, published in Ornyx: The International Journal of Conservation, also stated that consumer campaigns raising awareness about sustainable seafood do not effectively promote conservation. "

Two studies from Queen Mary University of London and the University of Cambridge suggest insects possess intelligent behaviors once thought unique to larger animals. Debunking the notion that body size is proportionate to intelligence, scientists say bigger animals need bigger brains to sustain a larger nervous system, and they are not necessarily more complex. The studies conclude that advanced thinking can exist in brains with a limited number of neurons. "

VEGETABLES’ ROSY GLOW,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/vegetables-rosy-glow,"NOVEMBER 16, 2009","Recent research shows that a veg diet is as beneficial for beauty as it is for health. Researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland asked 54 men and women to use computer manipulation to adjust people’s skin tone to make it look healthier and more attractive. They made skin rosier, brighter, and more yellow. Scientists say the best way to achieve this desirable complexion is not to get a tan, but to eat ample fruits and vegetables. Rosy skin indicates a healthy circulatory system, and a yellow skin hue may be achieved by eating foods rich in carotenoids, which are antioxidants found in brightly colored produce. "
BOOK REVIEW: EATING ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/book-review-eating-animals,"NOVEMBER 16, 2009"," Writing. It’s a peculiar exercise. Every scribe starts off exactly equal-pen and paper, typewriter, keyboard. Yet the end products are as disparate as the sketches of five-year olds with a box of 96 Crayolas and a drawing tablet. And imagination. Enter novelist Jonathan Safran Foer (Everything is Illuminated; Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close). Fatherhood sets him off on a three-year quest “to learn as much as [he] can about the meat industry, in an effort to make informed decisions about what to feed [his] son.” This journey leads to Eating Animals, Foer’s tale in which the first word in the title can be verb or adjective, and is often both simultaneously. The author’s storytelling prowess and talent to craft a sentence make Eating a stellar effort. Consider: A best-selling, award-winning novelist writes a non-fiction book about “what meat is. … Through my efforts as a parent, I came face-to-face with realities that as a citizen I couldn’t ignore, and as a writer I couldn’t keep to myself.” Anyone who eats should be glad he did. Foer’s celebrity will get his book into the hands of many who would never consider the subject; he’s the antidote (and perhaps heir apparent) to Michael Pollan, who—rightfully—feels the sting of Foer’s barbs throughout. Foer begins with a tongue-in-jowl intellectual exercise on eating dogs [“The inefficient use of dogs—conveniently already in areas of high human population (take note, local food advocates)—should make any ecologist blush”], even offering a classic Filipino recipe for “Stewed Dog, Wedding Style.” Of course there is no difference; this guy knows how to set the table. Along the way of trespassing on factory farms and visiting small-scale, heritage animal growers both Foer’s story and understanding evolve, right before the reader’s eyes. He’s that good. Even his mistakes have the Midas touch. At 32, Foer, albeit accomplished, is still young. He disliked animals until six years ago (he got a dog), and his two-decade flirtation with vegetarianism was tenuous at best. While vegan today, he’s still uncertain, as the chapter title “I Can’t Go to the Word Wrong” makes obvious. Maybe not for himself, but for others—he’s not about to tell anyone to go veg. “Meat is not for me, and factory farming is a holocaust, but you make up your own mind,” one can almost hear him say. A seasoned activist could not have written this book. The result of this, “greenness” to the cause, yields great benefit, though probably not to well-versed vegetarians, who will find nearly nothing new here. The triumph of Eating Animals is found in Foer’s skill as a raconteur coupled with his ability to reach a mass audience. He’s Pollan-esque without the disingenuousness, and he’s far more accepting of non-vegetarians than any meat-eating foodie is of us. Eating Animals belongs among the must-reads of animal advocacy literature. The book it most recalls, also by a young man in the fourth decade of his life who turned his attention to factory farming, was published a generation ago. With any luck, Foer’s masterpiece should become the new Diet for a New America, and usher in the next great wave of vegetarianism. Click here to read the VegNews interview with Jonathan Safran Foer.

IS SOY HEALTHY? WE HAVE THE ANSWER,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/is-soy-healthy-we-have-the-answer,"NOVEMBER 16, 2009","We receive a constant stream of information about the food we eat, and it’s always changing. A once celebrated superfood can be condemned as a health risk, depending on which person you ask. One such food is soy, usually a mainstay in the veg diet. Whether it’s tofu, tempeh, or soymilk, soy foods are everywhere in the US—soy food sales reached $4 billion in 2008. Some consumers avoid it, others enjoy it in moderation, and some people can’t get enough. Here are some widely touted studies that explore the pros and cons of this ubiquitous bean. Lowers Fertility
In 2008, a preliminary study from the Harvard School of Public Health suggests soy might lower sperm count. The study involved 99 men who visited a fertility clinic between 2000 and 2006. Scientists analyzed their intake of soy foods, such as tofu, tempeh, faux meats, soymilk, and energy bars, and found a negative correlation between soy intake and sperm count. The men who consumed the most soy, equivalent to about half a serving per day, had 41 million fewer sperm per millimeter compared to men who consumed no soy food at all. However, scientists say the study was too small to be sure soy inhibits reproduction. Bone Density Boost
Italian researchers discovered that a chemical compound in soy might increase bone density in post-menopausal women. Genistein, an isoflavone in soy, may mimic the behavior of estrogen in the human body. Estrogen levels decrease after menopause, which decreases bone mass, so scientists wanted to see if soy could reverse this process. They took 389 post-menopausal women with below average bone density, and randomly assigned them a daily supplement with genistein, calcium, and vitamin D, or just calcium and vitamin D. After two years, the group that took genistein gained bone mass, while the other group lost bone mass. Unfortunately, the supplements were equivalent to eating eight pounds of tofu daily, so you could not achieve these results by eating whole foods. Promotes Cancer
There may also be a downside to genistein’s estrogen-like effects. In a study published in 2008, US researchers found that dietary genistein increased tumor size in mice and neutralized the therapeutic effects of aromatase inhibitors. Doctors use aromatase inhibitors to treat estrogen-dependent breast cancer, which is the most common type of breast cancer in the US. The levels of genistein used in the study were comparable to dietary levels in people. The research suggests that post-menopausal women with breast cancer who use aromatase inhibitors should avoid genistein, and therefore soy, because it could counteract their treatment. Prevents Cancer
Different studies, different results. Researchers at the National Cancer Center in Tokyo determined that high levels of genistein reduced breast cancer risk. Scientists studied 24,226 Japanese women aged 40 to 69 by sampling their blood and completing dietary evaluations. After 10 years, 144 women developed breast cancer. Scientists organized the women into four groups according to their genistein levels, and the group with the highest amount of the compound was 65 percent less likely to have breast cancer than the group with the lowest amount. These genistein levels came from the women’s diet, suggesting soy food has preventative benefits. "
DRURY UNIVERSITY OFFERS ANIMAL-RIGHTS EDUCATION,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/drury-university-offers-animal-rights-education,"NOVEMBER 16, 2009","With the help of one famous alumnus, Drury University in Springfield, Mo., is giving the Heartland a humane education. Longtime host of The Price is Right Bob Barker contributed $1 million to Drury, establishing a full-time professorship for Animal Rights. Patricia McEachern, a professor of French and director of the previously formed Forum on Animal Rights (also made possible by Barker), will oversee the development of the curriculum full-time, now able to devote herself completely thanks to the Dorothy Jo Barker Endowed Professorship, named for Barker’s late wife. Over the next year, McEachern hopes to add at least two more courses, slowly building the Forum up to a possible minor, and, eventually, major area of study. McEachern gave VegNews her insight into this advancement for animal-rights education. VegNews: Why is it important to offer animal-rights courses at the college level?
Patricia McEachern: The decisions we make about how we interact with animals affect them and us profoundly. These students are our future judges, doctors, lawyers, veterinarians, writers, and politicians. I hope that future decisions they make about how they choose to live their lives with regard to human-animal interactions will be made based on knowledge and respect. The time is right for this kind of education. Americans love animals and they are more interested in how we treat animals now than ever before in my lifetime. VN: What are the short-term effects you’ve seen the course have on students? What do you foresee for the long-term?
PM: There are students enrolled who might otherwise not have learned about animals-rights issues. Most of them are interested in animals, but they were unaware of many of the harsh realities. When reading student journals, I am impressed by how often they say that they have made changes because of what they have learned. I have also noticed that a number of them are struggling with whether or not to make changes in their personal lives. I see that as a predictor of both short-term and long-term effects. VN: Do you have a favorite person discussed in the course?
PM: Bob Barker! He generously made an appearance in the Animal Ethics class and gave students an inside view of the terrible exploitation of animals in entertainment. No one else could have presented the material with as much authority, experience, or compassion. VN: You also nominated Barker for his Honorary Doctorate degree from Drury. What compelled you to take that step?
PM: Bob made an enormous impact on me when I saw the news coverage of the “fur flap” back in the 1980s. That was when he stopped working with the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants because the producers refused to honor their promise to him that the contestants would no longer wear fur coats. There were some philosophers writing about animal rights at the time, but Bob Barker was working in the trenches, and his efforts encouraged many of us who cared about animals. In addition, his spay/neuter message at the end of The Price is Right has done more to “help control the pet population” than any other effort I know of. VN: What is your personal relationship with animal rights?
PM: I stopped eating meat at the age of fourteen after spending a few weeks on a farm. At the time, I had never heard the word “vegetarian;” I thought I was the only one in the world. We have come a long way since then. Not eating meat no longer makes a person seem like a social oddity. VN: If there is one thing you hope students learn from your courses, what would it be?
PM: Respect, respect, respect. Animals are sentient beings who deserve our respect and our compassion. "

ANIMAL ABUSE VIDEO ROCKS NATION,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/animal-abuse-video-rocks-nation,"NOVEMBER 9, 2009","On October 30, The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Vermont Agency of Agriculture suspended operations at a veal slaughterhouse after an undercover investigation by the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) revealed deplorable animal welfare violations. Undercover footage captured by an HSUS investigator revealed that Bushway Packing Inc., located in Grand Isle, Vt., routinely treated veal calves with cruelty and that its killing methods were in direct violation of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA). In light of the cruel conditions revealed in the video, HSUS is urging the USDA to tighten regulations for the transport and slaughter of veal calves. The plant specializes in producing meat from infant calves, known in the industry as “bob veal.” According to USDA Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, the plant closure will be followed with a continued investigation by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and a criminal investigation of the violations committed in the video. While there are no federal guidelines governing animal confinement on factory farms, the HMSA makes it clear that animals must be “rendered insensible” to meet humane slaughter standards. Vilsack called the behavior of FSIS and USDA personnel documented in the video “inexcusable,” and for Paul Shapiro, senior director for HSUS, this is only the tip of the iceberg.  “Two critically-needed reforms at USDA include banning the slaughter of calves who are too weak to stand and prohibiting transport of calves prior to 10 days of age. These two improvements wouldn’t fix everything, but they’d certainly be positive movement,” says Shapiro. The graphic undercover video shows workers from the plant killing veal calves that have not been properly stunned, and repeatedly shocking and kicking animals that cannot stand up. One excerpt shows a dying calf, his throat already severed, lying conscious on a slaughterhouse table. Disturbed by this flagrant violation of the HMSA, the HSUS undercover investigator notifies a nearby USDA inspector, who instructs him to only notify plant personnel of such problems in the future, because, “That’s something I’m not supposed to know, because I could shut them down for that.” According to HSUS, another scene shows the co-owner of the slaughterhouse stun and then heave a downed calf to his feet while cursing at the infant animal. Shortly after the USDA suspended action at the plant, major news outlets from across the country picked up the story and described, in detail, the animal-welfare violations that the HSUS video captured. Shapiro believes that the film is a powerful medium for promoting awareness and education concerning factory farming. “A picture is worth a thousand words and a video is worth a thousand pictures. Little is more effective at changing behavior than simply documenting what happens to animals on factory farms and in slaughter plants and letting the public see it with their own eyes,” he says. In addition to banning the slaughter of downer calves and the transportation of calves younger than 10 days old, HSUS is now calling for federal inspectors to receive more training to better enforce humane treatment. In early 2009 the US banned downer cattle from the food supply industry, after a 2008 HSUS investigation uncovered animal abuse at the Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing plant in California. This measure, however, precludes treating ailing veal calves, who can currently be monitored under USDA supervision—an exception that the HSUS calls a loophole to the law. The group hopes that its most recent investigation in Vermont will change the way the USDA approaches downer calves. "

COWBOY’S VEGAN SUCCESS,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/cowboys-vegan-success,"NOVEMBER 8, 2009","Dr. Oz’s vegan challenge was a success for Rocco Wachman. On his daytime talk show, Dr. Mehmet Oz challenged the 50-something cowboy to a four-week plant-based diet designed to treat his obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Wachman says the first seven days were difficult, when he switched from eating meat at every meal to eating seven small meals per day of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and soy protein. Eventually, he got used to the new food. He lost 30 pounds, lowered his blood sugar, and stopped taking two of his three medications. Wachman says he ate meat after his diet ended, but found it unfulfilling and will avoid it. "
THANKSGIVING GOURMET,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/thanksgiving-gourmet,"NOVEMBER 8, 2009","For some, the challenge of preparing a large, hearty holiday meal may seem too overwhelming. Thankfully, there are many vegan-friendly gourmet restaurants up to the task. Upscale New York eatery Candle 79—voted VN Restaurant of the Year—transformed its menu to appeal to holiday palettes, with Chef Angel serving seasonal dishes such as mache and endive salad with acorn squash, wild rice, Jerusalem artichokes, grilled pears, toasted pecans, and cranberry dressing.

GREEN TEA PREVENTS CANCER?,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/green-tea-prevents-cancer,"NOVEMBER 8, 2009","Green-tea extract may guard against oral cancer, according to the American Association for Cancer Research. Scientists at the University of Texas gave volunteers three different levels of green-tea extract for three months, and measured the response of pre-cancerous mouth lesions. They found that 59 percent of people consuming the highest level of extract had a positive response, compared to 18 percent in the placebo group. Researchers are encouraged by this study, but say the trial was too small to make any definite claims about cancer prevention. The amount of green-tea extract participants consumed was equivalent to eight to 10 cups of brewed tea per day. "

The episode centered around a murder that took place at a chicken farm, and the factory farm footage was provided by Farm Sanctuary at Deschanel’s request. In the episode, a character rescues a pig and sponsors her at a sanctuary. Taking the episode theme one step further, Deschanel recorded a special message about the horrors of factory farming for the Bones website. "
FRESHWATER FISH ENDANGERED,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/freshwater-fish-endangered,"NOVEMBER 5, 2009","Approximately one third of the world’s freshwater fish species face extinction, according to The International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global environmental group founded in 1948. On Tuesday, it released its annual ”Red List,” revealing which animal and plant species are threatened. Scientists found that of the 3,120 freshwater fish species studied, 1,147 are critically endangered. They say freshwater plant and animal species have been ignored too long and are in jeopardy because of pollution and land development. All together, the organization found that over a third of the world’s species could soon be extinct. "
AMERICANS HEAVIER THAN EVER,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/americans-heavier-than-ever,"NOVEMBER 5, 2009","A study from the World Health Organization says 66 percent of the US adult population is overweight. The findings state that on average, adults in the US are eating upwards of 3,500 calories each day, even though 2,000 calories is enough for an active adult. Researchers examined the types of food consumed and found that overall food choice also has a significant impact on health. On average, in Brazil, where diets are heavier in grains, adults still consume 3,000 calories per day, but only 40 percent of its population is overweight. "
OHIO APPROVES ISSUE TWO,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/ohio-approves-issue-two,"NOVEMBER 4, 2009","On November 3, 64 percent of Ohio voters approved Issue Two, a constitutional amendment designed to prevent the animal welfare legislation recently passed in Michigan and California. The measure will create a 13-member Livestock Care Standards Board to regulate the treatment of farm animals in Ohio. It will include consumers, farmers, veterinarians, and only one representative from a humane society. The Humane Society of the United States says this development is unfortunate, but it will continue to push for reform in states like Ohio to eliminate inhumane animal confinement on factory farms. Supporters say Issue Two lets Ohio make its own decisions about its food systems, but the Ohio Farmers Union opposed the amendment, saying the issue should have been further negotiated to prevent unnecessary bureaucracy.

US CLIMATE CHANGE DELAY,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/us-climate-change-delay,"NOVEMBER 4, 2009","The US Senate delayed the climate change bill another five weeks, preventing a resolution before the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the US to create its own binding climate change laws before the Copenhagen conference begins on December 7, saying US legislation is crucial for a successful international agreement about how to fight global warming. Republican senators are boycotting the debate about the climate change bill because they say the Environmental Protection Agency’s cost estimates are not accurate. "

Representatives from New York-based slaughterhouse Fairbank Farms announced they will recall all the ground beef produced in the factory between September 14 and September 16, after the US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service identified a cluster of E. coli illness in Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts. The recall applies to the eight states that distribute Fairbank Farms beef, but the company said some distributors might have shipped tainted meat to other states. Currently, health officials in both New York and New Hampshire confirmed E. coli related deaths. "

FAST FOOD BLUES,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/fast-food-blues,"NOVEMBER 3, 2009","It seems like a fruit and veggie filled diet is as good for the mind as it is for the body. Researchers at University College London looked at the diets of 3,500 people to see if there was a link between what they ate and whether they developed depression five years later. They found that people who ate mainly processed food had a 58 percent higher risk of developing depression than those who ate a whole-foods diet full of fruits and vegetables. While researchers did not advocate a veg diet (fish is included as a healthy food), processed meats and high-fat dairy were in the junk food category. "
ROYAL VEGAN BANQUET,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/royal-vegan-banquet,"NOVEMBER 2, 2009","Windsor Castle will see its first-ever vegan banquet as part of an international conference highlighting religious leaders’ influence on environmental issues. Britain’s Prince Philip and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will host the lunchtime meal, scheduled for November 3. Caterers planned a vegan menu because the expected guests belong to a variety of different faiths (such as Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Daoism) with different dietary requirements. The best way to accommodate everyone is to serve completely vegan food, which is also eco-friendly. The menu will include a roasted English pear salad and stuffed portabello mushrooms. "
AL GORE’S CLIMATE CHANGE BOOK,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/al-gores-climate-change-book,"NOVEMBER 2, 2009","Today, former Vice President and Nobel Prize winner Al Gore releases his latest book, Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis. The book is a call to action to solve environmental issues and serves as a follow-up to his 2006 book, An Inconvenient Truth. Gore outlines the changes private citizens and government officials can make, but critics are already attacking Gore for not practicing what he preaches. Last week, everyone from animal-rights group PETA to conservative pundit Glenn Beck criticized Gore for continuing to support the environmentally crippling system of factory farming by eating an omnivorous diet. "
PIG DNA DECODED,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/pig-dna-decoded,"NOVEMBER 2, 2009","A global group of researchers announced November 2 that they have decoded the DNA of the domestic pig. They say this development could help treat diseases in pigs as well as people and may lead to an H1N1 vaccine for pigs. The mapped genome could also be used to protect rare, endangered, and wild pig species. Scientists say this breakthrough will aid research about human health, because the physical makeup and dietary needs of pigs and humans are so similar. Although medical research using pigs is an unfortunate reality, this development is another reminder that humans are not as different from other animals as some people believe. "

VERMONT VEAL VIOLATIONS,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/vermont-veal-violations,"NOVEMBER 1, 2009","The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is investigating Bushway Packing Inc., a slaughterhouse located in Vermont, because of its cruel treatment and inhumane slaughter of veal calves. On undercover video footage from the plant, workers kill veal calves that have not been stunned properly and repeatedly shock and kick animals that cannot stand up, according to The Humane Society of the United States. The USDA and Vermont Agency of Agriculture closed the slaughterhouse when the allegations were brought to light October 30. Approximately 700,000 veal calves are killed in the US each year. "
VEGGIES CUT DIABETES RISK,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/veggies-cut-diabetes-risk,"NOVEMBER 1, 2009","Increasing vegetable intake in pregnant women may help prevent type 1 diabetes in their children, according to a study from the Sahlgrenska Academy. Researchers analyzed the blood of approximately 5,700 five-year-olds to measure the amount of certain antibodies that indicate risk for developing the disease. Risk markers were doubly common in children whose mothers did not eat many vegetables while pregnant. Children who displayed the least amount of risk markers had mothers who ate vegetables daily during pregnancy. Further investigation is needed to see if vegetables themselves have this beneficial effect, or if it is another related factor. Approximately one in every 400 to 600 children in the US suffer from type 1 diabetes. "
INTERVIEW WITH VEGAN SONGSTRESS NELLIE MCKAY,https://vegnews.com/2009/11/interview-with-vegan-songstress-nellie-mckay,"NOVEMBER 1, 2009","Anyone who has had the pleasure of meeting the 27-year-old singer/songwriter can attest that Nellie McKay may be from a different decade. Since the time-travel theory is out of the question, fans will simply have to welcome this old soul as a breathe of fresh, optimistic air, stumbling over innocent sentences punctuated with just the right amount of self-deprecation to keep her honest and human. Hidden between every “Oh, gee” and “just lovely” is an extremely talented young woman, dedicated to not only her art, but to a crucial cause—animal rights. An animal activist since the age of seven, McKay weaves her vegan ethics into her work, putting more soul behind her genre-busting brand of music than the majority of today’s acts. Her latest album, Normal As Blueberry Pie: A Tribute to Doris Day, pays homage to her longtime musical and personal idol. This 13-track masterpiece is bursting with Day’s timeless tunes and infused with McKay’s contagious spirit. VN recently sat down with the New York-based artist, currently touring the US, for a sneak peek behind the scenes. VegNews: You’re a long-time fan of Doris Day. When and how did you decide you were going to record this album?
Nellie McKay: It was suggested to me by my A&R [Ed. note: A&R scouts new talent and develops current artists]. It isn’t something I would’ve had the chutzpah to do myself, but it’s just been such a delight—so much more fun than recording my own songs. I would think that this is an album that grandmothers could enjoy. VN: What do you hope your fans and listeners take away from the album?
NM: You want it to make people interested in the canon of Doris Day. I would like it to lead people to discovering her music. Otherwise, music is so personal. People can take it in the car with them, or listen to it as they’re going to sleep, so maybe to help someone personally. VN: What about Doris Day’s music do you think is so beneficial for people to rediscover?
NM: It’s reassuring. In addition to being such a retro figure, she was involved with a cause [animal rights] that is still so far ahead of its time. She works for people moving forward, and for looking backwards. I think she helps put a little pep in your step. VN: How does veganism impact your music?
NM: It is nice to be able to make music that reflects what you care about. Like “If I Ever Had a Dream,” on the album—that’s about the animals. We’re hoping to make a video that incorporates Doris Day’s activism, me at home with my doggies, shots of animals in exploited circumstances, and animals being treated well, and juxtapose them and come up with a video that reflects that it’s a dream of a world without all this human-imposed suffering. People can call it sentimental, but it’s just that basic thing—it’s not nice to see some body or being that is in pain, and people have that gut reaction. They want to ignore it because they like the taste of their burger, or their chicken, but most people do have empathy. I think that’s what scares them so much. VN: When did you start performing, and when did you know you wanted to be a singer and songwriter?
NM: When my grades got so bad, everything was pretty much ruled out! I don’t know, I was just reading all of those biographies, alienated from my peers, and I always loved a pretty picture. When you’re in showbiz, it’s kind of like eternal childhood. The play never stops, and who wouldn’t want to be in show biz? VN: if you had to sum up your life philosophy in a sentence, what would it be?
NM: Just try to be more like a dog. VN: Anything else?
NM: If people can keep on going vegan, and we can get health care, I’m going to be set for the next 10 years. "
BEST-SELLING VEG BOOKS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/best-selling-veg-books,"OCTOBER 31, 2009","Proving that veg-friendly fare is more popular than ever, two vegan books cracked the top five of the New York Times best-seller list this week.

NUTRITION GUIDE FOR VEG TEENS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/nutrition-guide-for-veg-teens,"OCTOBER 31, 2009","With the social pressures and busy lives that befall the average American adolescent, nutrition often takes a back seat. This is even more of an issue for the veg-inclined, because accessibility becomes a problem. Although schools are offering more meatless options than ever before, jam-packed schedules make the convenient lure of the vending machine even more tempting. Whether you’re a teen or a parent, here is some healthy advice to keep the high school set going strong. Ample Calories
Teens are growing, so getting sufficient calories is important. The American Heart Association recommends that between the ages of 14 and 18, girls should consume 1,800 calories daily and boys should consume 2,200. Dry cereal for breakfast is not a healthy start. Eating almond butter on whole grain toast topped with banana slices and a glass of soymilk is a better way to provide needed calories and nutrients. Keep energy high all day by including healthy and portable snacks for all those on-the-go activities. Pump Up the Protein
Protein is important for building muscles and bones and for bodily repair. Include a variety of beans, soy foods, nuts, and whole grains. A varied diet including these foods on a daily basis will provide more than enough protein. As a bonus, these foods are high in fiber, calcium, and of course, cholesterol free, when compared to their non-veg counterparts. Omega Boost
At this highly hormonal time, omega fats are vital to combat acne. Invite foods high in omega fats to become regulars at your kitchen table, such as walnuts, pumpkin seeds, and flax seeds. Remember to grind flax seeds to get the most nutritional benefits. You can also include a supplement of flax, borage, or evening primrose oil. Hemp oil is also a source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids that tastes great on salads. Vitamins and Minerals
Iron may be an issue, particularly for teen girls. Include foods such as blackstrap molasses, beans, dried fruits, and turnip greens. An essential nutrient for energy, B12 must be conscientiously included in a vegan diet. One of the best-and tastiest-sources of B12 is Red Star nutritional yeast. It makes an exquisite topping for popcorn, salads, and steamed veggies. It is also the star ingredient in many a vegan mac and cheese. If nutritional-yeast gravy is not on the menu, consider a B12 supplement. Calcium is needed for strong bones, and a teen’s recommended intake of calcium is 1,300 milligrams. This can be easily met with nuts and seeds, dark leafy greens, blackstrap molasses, dried figs, and fortified foods such as tofu (made with calcium) and non-dairy milk. When thinking about calcium and bone health, it’s important to remember vitamin D. The sun helps our bodies produce vitamin D, which helps absorb calcium. So go play outside! "
INTERVIEW WITH JONATHAN SAFRAN FOER ON EATING ANIMALS AND MORE,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/interview-with-jonathan-safran-foer-on-eating-animals-and-more,"OCTOBER 31, 2009","With two bestselling novels under his belt, one of which made its way to the movie screen, Jonathan Safran Foer has taken a detour to the world of non-fiction. Eating Animals serves as a discussion on Foer’s personal ethical journey and his need to discover the truth behind one of America’s biggest industries—animal agriculture. Inspired by the birth of his son, Foer spent three years diligently researching, philosophizing, and chronicling his entire experience in this thoughtful, eloquent volume. Foer talked with VegNews about his latest masterpiece, vegetarianism, and his secrets to writing success. VegNews: There has been huge buzz surrounding your New York Times Magazine article, modeled on Eating Animals. Following the NYT’s shocking exposé about E. coli, your piece further advocated against meat to a mainstream audience. What are your thoughts on the progress of vegetarianism?
Jonathan Safran Foer: Between 25 and 30 percent of Americans now are vegetarian, vegetarian-leaning, or vegetarian-inclined. Those aren’t exactly clearly drawn lines, but the notion of trying to eat less meat being good for us … has totally infiltrated every part of America. In the last couple of years, there’s been a really dramatic movement, which you can either describe as being away from factory farming, or towards vegetarianism. In my book, I argue that those are very similar movements. Too much energy is spent distinguishing between those two things when in fact, I met lots and lots of farmers in the last three years, and the ethic that family farmers espouse has so much overlap with the PETA ethic. VN: Do you think working with these local farmers and trying to find allies will help eliminate factory farming?
JSF: Well, one can move in many directions at once. I think it’s clearly what most of the big players in the movement have chosen … I would never eat a product of some of the very best farms I went to, but I would also have a hard time putting all my energy into arguing against them. I went to farms where—in a very objective, straight-forward way—I have to admit they treat their animals better than I treat my dog. But of course, I don’t kill my dog at the end. Now there’s still a reason I wouldn’t eat what they make. A large part of that is because I think by eating any of it, you’re implicitly endorsing factory farming. VN: What do you think is keeping people from making the connection of factory farms to the meat on their plates?
JSF: Peoples’ responses to food, the reason they take it so emotionally and so many smart, informed people continue to eat this stuff—it’s not because they’re ignorant, it’s not because they’re evil. It’s because there’s a large component of our decision-making that isn’t reasonable. The challenge is to persuade people, or show people, even those parts that aren’t reasonable, things like cravings, are actually better satisfied by not eating them. I think the better way to talk about it is like a series of these choices. Like how can one try to make the best choice as often as possible? The “best” meaning the choice that is in line with their values. Despite the array of values that Americans have, if everyone ate his values, nobody would eat factory farmed meat. And I think, frankly, very few people would eat any kind of meat. Nobody’s values lead them there. It’s only forgetfulness. VN: Where do you get your inspiration for your work?
JSF: To me, it’s much more about will—facing the blank page and having your self-confidence tested, being made to feel self-conscious or vulnerable, dumb, and all the other things that writing regularly forces you to feel, and forcing words onto the page. What I find most inspiring, rather, what I appreciate most about writing is that it’s not something magical. VN: Your fiction features veg characters—is this a conscious decision?
JSF: It just came quite naturally to me. My politics, or worldly concerns, don’t really get into my fiction. I don’t want them to. Fiction is a place, and should be, independent of all that stuff. VN: What advice would you give to beginner writers?
JSF: Not to think of yourself as a beginner writer. When you decide you want to write, you’re a writer. That’s it. There’s no such thing as an aspiring writer—it doesn’t make any sense. Put your head down and make your writing something that’s separate from the world. "
PETITION TO BAN MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/petition-to-ban-meat,"OCTOBER 30, 2009","A group of private citizens in Germany are asking like-minded folks from around the world to support the legal ban of meat. They recently launched a petition, “Stop Eating Meat and Heal Our Planet,” through Care2, an online community that supports green and healthy living. According to the petition’s mission statement, it will be delivered to governments in Europe and across the world at the Copenhagen 2009 Climate Conference. The group’s goal is to garner at least 10,000 signatures before the conference begins in December. Currently, the petition has more than 5,000 signatures. "
SOUTH PARK’S WHALE WAR,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/south-parks-whale-war,"OCTOBER 29, 2009","On Wednesday night, a new episode of South Park dubbed ”Whale Whores” poked fun at the Japanese whaling controversy. After character Stan Marsh sees the Japanese attack dolphins at the Denver Aquarium, he discovers the reality show Whale Wars and decides to volunteer with the Sea Shepherd crew. Japanese whalers harpoon Captain Paul Watson on Stan’s first day, and in retaliation he blows up the enemy ship. Stan is made captain, and the popularity of Whale Wars skyrockets—reviews clamor that “things actually happen now!” In true South Park style, everything from Japanese whaling to American factory farming is critiqued and left up for debate by the end of the episode. "
ECO-FASHION SHOW,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/eco-fashion-show,"OCTOBER 29, 2009","On Sunday, Chicago Fashion Week 2009 was capped off with the city’s first-ever green fashion show, Vert Couture. Fashions from local, eco-friendly designers such as Bryan McLemore Smith and Vaute Couture were runway favorites, along with the inspiring spring collections presented by students from the International School of Design and Technology. Sustainability wasn’t limited to the cruelty-free designs, as guests were served organic, vegan drinks and hors d’oeuvres. Chicago Fashion Focus sponsored the event, and all proceeds will be donated to the Chicago Fashion Foundation. "
ECUADOR AMAZON FUND,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/ecuador-amazon-fund,"OCTOBER 29, 2009","Ecuador would rule out oil drilling in Yasuni National Park if it received financial support to cover lost profits. Yasuni National Park, located in the Amazon rainforest, is a United Nations biosphere reserve and home to isolated indigenous tribes. If Ecuador does not drill in the park’s oil reserves, it stands to lose an estimated $6 billion over 10 years, but this would prevent 410 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from contributing to global warming. Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa was in London this week to promote an initiative that would prohibit oil drilling if other countries pay Ecuador at least half of the expected revenue, or $3 billion. Germany, Spain, and France have expressed interest in the plan, but they have not made any firm promises. "
BRITISH LORD BACKS GOING VEG,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/british-lord-backs-going-veg,"OCTOBER 28, 2009","Earlier this week, British climate change crusader Lord Nicholas Stern told a London newspaper that eating meat contributes to global warming, and the solution is to adopt a vegetarian diet. According to Stern, if countries agree to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the upcoming Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in December, the cost of meat will rise. Stern believes that humans will eventually stop eating meat when confronted with the damage caused by consuming animals. In recent weeks Stern has also been vocal about how necessary it is for President Obama to attend the Copenhagen conference because of the US’s world influence. "
"LESS PROTEIN, MORE MUSCLE",https://vegnews.com/2009/10/less-protein-more-muscle,"OCTOBER 28, 2009","A recent study suggests that eating more protein does not necessarily build more muscle mass. Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston compared the rate of muscle synthesis in people who ate either four ounces or 12 ounces of a protein-rich food. The same amount of muscle was produced in both cases. The study was performed with beef, but tofu and nuts are listed as beneficial sources of the important macronutrient. Instead of eating one protein-filled meal per day, researchers recommend incorporating four ounces of a protein-rich food at every meal to efficiently build muscles. "
SUSTAINABLE PALM OIL,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/sustainable-palm-oil,"OCTOBER 28, 2009","Nestlé and Marks and Spencer have both announced that by 2015, the only palm oil in their products will be Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO). The deforestation necessary to produce conventional palm oil threatens the habitats of endangered species and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, while the production of CSPO must meet guidelines that ensure valuable forests are protected and environmental safeguards are met. According to a report from the World Wildlife Fund, most European retailers are not buying the more expensive, earth-friendly oil. The report ranks several companies that purchase palm oil according to how sustainable their practices are. "
NATALIE PORTMAN ON TOP CHEF,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/natalie-portman-on-top-chef,"OCTOBER 27, 2009","Natalie Portman is tonight’s special guest on the reality cooking competition Top Chef, which airs on Bravo. The contestants’ task is to cook for Portman, a long-time vegetarian, now vegan. The episode preview begins with the crew of chefs racing through a steakhouse to survey the meat they might use in their challenge, but everything changes when Portman describes her dietary preferences. The actress recently wrote a review of Jonathan Safran Foer’s Eating Animals, a book she credits for her shift to a vegan diet. “Factory farming of animals will be one of the things we look back on as a relic of a less-evolved age,” says Portman. "
ENERGY EFFICIENCY ISSUE,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/energy-efficiency-issue,"OCTOBER 27, 2009","It’s a state that produces large amounts of coal, oil, natural gas, and wind power, but Wyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal insists that energy efficiency is best regulated on either a local or federal level. For Freudenthal, it’s a simple issue of law and jurisdiction—new, sustainable building codes are set locally, while appliance standards are best mandated federally. However, after placing last in state rankings for energy efficiency, Wyoming’s governor recently signed a letter to the Department of Energy, promising renewed efforts in boosting his state’s energy efficiency in order to receive federal stimulus money.

VEGAN BEER GUIDE,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/vegan-beer-guide,"OCTOBER 26, 2009","Holidays, sporting events, an afternoon in the park, happy hour—there is always an occasion for a frosty glass of cold beer. However, some beers contain additives such as gelatin, casein, and albumen, while isinglass is frequently used in the filtering, making it necessary for vegans to be aware of which ales are cruelty-free. All of the following breweries make fully vegan beers. The only non-vegan beers produced by the listed companies specifically mention honey in the variety’s name. That means as long as it doesn’t say “honey,” it’s yours to crack open. Cheers! Abita

VEGAN RECIPE ON ELLEN,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/vegan-recipe-on-ellen,"OCTOBER 26, 2009","Earlier this month, Ellen invited her personal chef Roberto Martin onto The Ellen Show to share a tasty vegan taco recipe. Last week, he returned to help Ellen cook a hearty vegan meal chock-full of comfort food. The holiday meal included a Field Roast celebration roast made with a rich, red-wine reduction, fluffy mashed potatoes, and grilled carrots, zucchini, and asparagus. Martin made sure to clarify that the red-wine reduction was made with vegan “beef” stock and the mashed potatoes were cooked with melted, vegan butter. Ellen repeatedly emphasized that the vegan meal was 100 percent mouthwatering and animal-free. "
WORLD CUP SACRIFICE,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/world-cup-sacrifice,"OCTOBER 26, 2009","A group organizing cultural events for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa wants to bless the tournament through ritual animal sacrifice. Zolani Mkiva, chairman of the Makhonya Royal Trust, says the potential animal sacrifice is meant to preserve African culture and ensure that everything goes well. Grahame L. Jones of the Los Angeles Times opposes this reasoning, saying there are many ways to celebrate South Africa’s culture without performing this act. The proposed ritual, which involves killing 10 cows to bless each of the 10 stadiums used in the international soccer competition, has not yet been approved or rejected by the World Cup Local Organizing Committee. "
FLORIDA SOLAR POWER,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/florida-solar-power,"OCTOBER 26, 2009","The Desoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center goes online today. It will produce 25 megawatts of power, making it the largest solar energy plant in the US. President Obama is scheduled to visit the power plant today in Arcadia, Fla., where it will start generating electricity for a small but significant fraction of Florida Power & Light customers. This plant, plus two other projects by Florida Power & Light, will produce 110 megawatts of power in total, reducing carbon emissions by more than 3.5 million tons. Although it cost $150 million dollars to complete, building the facility also created 400 jobs. "
SWEDISH GREEN LABELS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/swedish-green-labels,"OCTOBER 25, 2009","Sweden has introduced new food labels showing the carbon emissions related to individual food products, according to the New York Times. The food labels are an extension of new healthy eating guidelines supplied by the Nutrition Department at the Swedish National Food Administration. These guidelines are mindful of the environment and veg-friendly; they recommend avoiding fish, due to low European fish stocks, and replacing red meat with beans, because raising cattle has a large carbon footprint. While not all consumers seem motivated by the guidelines, if they were carefully followed, Sweden could reduce its food-related carbon emissions by up to 50 percent. "
LIVESTOCK CRISIS AND HOW A VEG DIET CAN HELP,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/livestock-crisis-and-how-a-veg-diet-can-help,"OCTOBER 25, 2009","The Worldwatch Institute released a report on October 20 that indicates animal agriculture has more of an impact on the planet than previously thought. A concern for the environment, along with animal welfare and personal health, has long been one of the main reasons for people to adopt a vegan or vegetarian diet. Gore’s 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth helped increase awareness about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming to the mainstream media and general public. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released an extensive report in November 2006 entitled ”Livestock’s Long Shadow.” It stated that animal agriculture was responsible for 18 percent of all GHG emissions, which was higher than contributions from transport. The report also said demand for livestock had significant negative effects on the world’s water supply and biodiversity. The evidence suggested that animal agriculture wasn’t just bad for animals, but also bad for the earth, affecting each and every one of us. The Worldwatch Institute’s report, written by Robert Goodland and Jeff Anhang, argues that the FAO’s estimates, while alarming, do not tell the entire story. The authors look at “overlooked and underestimated” sources of GHG emissions, including livestock respiration, the worldwide increase in livestock products since 2002 (which was the year the FAO obtained key statistics for its report), and the omission of farmed fish. According to their more recent research, they estimate that animal agriculture contributes to more than half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions (51 percent, to be exact). So what can be done about this global problem? The best solution, according to the authors of this report, is to find food alternatives for meat and dairy products, which is something that vegans and vegetarians in developed nations are already familiar with. The report says this consumer-driven change could have a more immediate effect on GHG emissions than replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy. Despite years of climate change negotiations, countries have not met emissions-reduction targets with the moderate developments in renewable energy that have occurred so far. “By replacing livestock products with analogs, consumers can take a single powerful action collectively to mitigate most GHGs worldwide.” Instead of changing governments or legislation, the report proposes changing the food industry itself. Using products such as soymilk and veggie burgers to replace their animal-derived counterparts would reduce atmospheric GHGs and help stop global food and water shortages. The report suggests that if individuals and industries follow specific guidelines, livestock products could decrease by up to 25 percent by 2017, which would reduce GHG emissions to a level that the Copenhagen Climate Conference is expected to aim for later this year. The report argues that with the support of food companies, meat and dairy analogs could be cheaper, easier to cook, and healthier than livestock products, easing the public’s transition to plant-based eating, especially if they are marketed appropriately. Developing countries currently believe meat and dairy means a better life, but substitutions could also be seen this way, which would prevent the increasing demand for animal products in highly populated developing nations. This analysis will surely spark debate with supporters of animal agriculture, just like the FAO report did three years ago. But as more research linking greenhouse-gas emissions to animal agriculture emerges, it becomes harder to ignore, especially when a reasonable solution to one of the world’s most pressing problems is clearly laid out. "
SOUTHWEST GOING GREEN,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/southwest-going-green,"OCTOBER 23, 2009","Southwest Airlines announced October 21 it would start testing a more eco-friendly aircraft in a bid to reduce carbon emissions. The new plane, a Boeing 737-700, has a number of new features that reduce the weight of the airplane by approximately five pounds per seat, which saves fuel, reduces emissions, and lowers costs. The new features include recyclable, carbon neutral carpeting and seat covers made from man-made leather alternatives, which are lighter and cruelty-free. Southwest Airlines will also start an improved onboard recycling program on November 1. "

INDIA CHINA CLIMATE CO-OP,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/india-china-climate-co-op,"OCTOBER 22, 2009","India and China, two of the top greenhouse gas emitting countries, signed an agreement Wednesday to cooperate on climate change policy. The two nations will share ideas about how to domestically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and how to deal with international climate change negotiations so that the interests of developing nations are protected. This show of solidarity comes before the international climate change conference in Copenhagen this December. A recent UN report suggested that India, China, and other developing nations will need extensive foreign aid from developed nations to help their economies grow in a sustainable manner. "
MINNESOTA TOWN GETS HEALTHY,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/minnesota-town-gets-healthy,"OCTOBER 22, 2009","Some townspeople have gone vegan while others have banished fast food from their homes and taken up new exercise routines. The people of Albert Lea, Minn., were motivated to get healthy by the Vitality Project, a program organized by non-profit AARP and the United Health Foundation. The two groups helped the city build five years worth of sidewalks and trails in just one year so that Albert Lea residents have a place to exercise. Community members embraced the endeavor; employers are giving workers time to exercise, local restaurants are adding healthier items to their menus, and grocery stores are promoting healthier foods. This community approach to wellness even extends to schoolchildren, who now take adult supervised “walking buses” to school. "
SCHOOL LUNCH REPORT,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/school-lunch-report,"OCTOBER 22, 2009","On Tuesday, the Institute of Medicine released a report recommending that the US Department of Agriculture set maximum calorie limits for school breakfasts and lunches. The group found that currently there is too much salt and not enough vegetables, fruits, and whole grains in meals offered through the federally funded National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. The report advises that vegetable servings should increase to three-quarters of a cup per day for grades kindergarten through eight and one cup per day for grades nine to 12. It also encourages schools to offer more green leafy vegetables in place of starchier vegetables, such as potatoes. "
TAL RONNEN ON OPRAH,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/tal-ronnen-on-oprah,"OCTOBER 21, 2009","Tal Ronnen, vegan chef extraordinaire and author of The Conscious Cook, will appear on Oprah’s daytime television show today as part of her “Simply the Best” episode. Ronnen, whom Oprah calls “the best vegan chef in America,” cooked for the media maven during her 21-day vegan cleanse. Oprah has shown support for the vegan lifestyle before, and she isn’t the only one who loves The Conscious Cook, which is VegNews’ “Book of the Year” for 2009. "
TARGET INVESTIGATED,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/target-investigated,"OCTOBER 21, 2009","The Cornucopia Institute, a public interest group, asked the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to examine if retail-giant Target is misrepresenting its products as organic. The group said a Target newspaper ad advertised Silk soymilk with an organic label, but the soymilk cartons in its store were properly labeled and did not make this claim. The USDA says it will evaluate the complaint to see if an investigation is necessary. The USDA has specific criteria for products that use the term “organic,” and it received 160 complaints in the last year relating to “organic” products that potentially misrepresented themselves to consumers. "
FDA NUTRITION STANDARDS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/fda-nutrition-standards,"OCTOBER 21, 2009","On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it would issue required nutrition labeling standards for food companies. With no currently enforced criteria, companies can create labels promoting the positive aspects of products, while downplaying the negatives—like deeming sugary cereals a good source of vitamins and fiber. One such nutrition labeling campaign, the Smart Choices program, gained attention from the FDA and consumers for its misleading labels when it launched this summer. Under the FDA changes, a company does not have to put nutritional information on the front of its products, but if it wants to do so it must meet agency guidelines. "
SIMPSONS HALLOWEEN SPECIAL,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/simpsons-halloween-special,"OCTOBER 20, 2009","Fans of The Simpsons are familiar with the much anticipated “Treehouse of Horror” episode that airs every year around Halloween. The special episode aired Sunday, and one of the three scary stories had a decidedly veg twist. In the vignette, “Don’t Have A Cow, Mankind,” Krusty the Clown unveils a new hamburger at his fast-food chain, dubbed the Burger Squared, telling consumers that it was created by “starting with Grade A beef, feeding it to other cows and then serving the unholy results on a seven grain bun.” The burger is tainted and turns the people of Springfield into zombies. Longtime vegan Apu rescues the Simpson family, but doesn’t fare so well himself. "
VEG AIRLINE EMPLOYEES,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/veg-airline-employees,"OCTOBER 20, 2009","For Air India employees, the price of eating meat is literally too high. The airline, based in Dehli, currently serves its employees chicken and fish at least three times a week, which cost more compared to the all-veggie meals offered on alternate days. In an effort to save money, most of the 1,100 employees that dine on the airline’s dime have suggested that an all-vegetarian menu may be the answer. Air India union leaders say management has been very receptive to the employee decision. While agreed on by the majority, some employees have expressed disdain for the cost-saving measure. Currently, at least 200 pounds of chicken is eaten by the airline’s staff every week. "
ENERGY STAR WOES,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/energy-star-woes,"OCTOBER 20, 2009","A report from the Department of Energy reveals the Energy Star program does not adequately monitor whether the products that use its label meet its criteria, according to The New York Times. While some items must be independently assessed before they use an Energy Star label, manufacturers of refrigerators, laundry machines, water heaters, and air conditioners can certify their own appliances. At least one recognized refrigerator model used the label while misrepresenting its energy consumption. The report calls for comprehensive independent testing for all product categories and improved retail oversight so consumer confidence in the program can continue. "
CHIPOTLE VEGAN OPTION,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/chipotle-vegan-option,"OCTOBER 19, 2009","Chipotle has unveiled a new vegan option at its Dupont Circle location in Washington, DC. The restaurant is serving its own meat alternative—a combination of wheat protein, soy protein, and fresh vegetables—which is marinated in Chipotle’s adobo sauce and grilled. Steve Ells, founder, chairman, and co-CEO of Chipotle, sees this vegan option as an extension of the company’s support for ethical farming practices. Ells wanted to provide a delicious, cruelty-free alternative for vegans, vegetarians, and meat-reducers alike.

VEG FOOD BLOG,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/veg-food-blog,"OCTOBER 19, 2009","In a cruelty-free spin on the popular book and film Julie & Julia, six vegan bloggers are cooking their way through Robin Robertson’s new cookbook, 1,000 Vegan Recipes. The blog, which was started on October 17, has covered six recipes so far, including Tempeh Satay, Roasted Vegetable Strudel, and Pear Fritters with Caramel Sauce. Robertson’s cookbook was released on October 5, and true to its name, features 1,000 veg recipes spanning everything from appetizers to desserts. According to the blog’s authors, the point of this cooking challenge isn’t to complete every recipe, but to have fun making as many veg-friendly dishes as possible. "
SEA SHEPHERD SHAKE-UP,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/sea-shepherd-shake-up,"OCTOBER 19, 2009","On Saturday, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society announced that its futuristic Earthrace defense vessel would now sail under a new moniker: the Ady Gil. Named in honor of a Sea Shepherd benefactor, the newly christened ship will join the team’s flagship Steve Irwin on its upcoming whale defense campaign in Antarctica, dubbed Operation Waltzing Matilda. Launching from Australia in December, the Ady Gil—with an impressive speed capacity of up to 50—will spend its first winter fighting illegal Japanese whaling in the arctic waters. Captain Paul Watson, Sea Shepherd president and founder, said that the Ady Gil will appear on the third season of Whale Wars. "
EU COD WORRIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/eu-cod-worries,"OCTOBER 18, 2009","The European Union announced Friday that fishermen must reduce their capture of cod and other threatened fish species by up to 25 percent to protect fish stocks in European waters. Today, cod populations in the North Sea, the eastern British Channel, and the Skagerrak strait have dwindled to 50,000 tons, down from 250,000 tons in the 1970s. According to environmentalists, fishing quotas were too high to maintain a healthy population of cod, and insubstantial fines did not effectively deter illegal fishing. Last month, the EU failed to protect blue-fin tuna from over fishing. "
BUNNIES USED AS FUEL,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/bunnies-used-as-fuel,"OCTOBER 18, 2009","Rabbit overpopulation has led government officials in Stockholm, Sweden to “recycle” the bodies of dead rabbits as fuel for energy plants. The overpopulation is caused by an increase of private citizens releasing pet rabbits into city parks and gardens, where they speedily multiply and ravage local vegetation. For Swedish animal-control authorities, the obvious solution is to shoot the excess rabbits, freeze them, and ship them to a heating plant in the country’s interior. Local animal-rights activists are denouncing the government’s answer to the overpopulation issue, arguing that it turns animals into an industry, instead of persecuting irresponsible pet guardians. "
FLORIDA TO BAN BAGS?,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/florida-to-ban-bags,"OCTOBER 18, 2009","Florida might be the first state to ban paper and plastic shopping bags. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) wants to eliminate paper and plastic shopping bags used in grocery stores and retail outlets. It will present a report to the Florida legislature about the benefits of such a policy by February 2010. The proposed ban would introduce a five-cent deposit for every non-reusable shopping bag, which would incrementally increase to 25 cents per bag by 2014. By 2015, the bags would be banned completely. Plastic and paper bags make up two percent of Florida’s litter, according to the DEP. "
COOK MORE KID-APPROVED VEGAN FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/cook-more-kid-approved-vegan-food,"OCTOBER 17, 2009","Most American adults have a hard enough time eating their fruits and veggies. But what about the younger generation? With constant kid-friendly advertising for toaster pastries and sugary cereal, it seems like kids need processed food to survive. The usual stereotype is that all youngsters hate vegetables, but this doesn’t have to be the case. Ideally, kids should eat fruits and vegetables with every meal, and at least half of their grain intake should be from whole grains. Raw foodist and author Robyn Boyd has some suggestions to make sure kids eat what’s good for them—without the help of a cartoon mascot. 1. Involve kids in your kitchen mishaps
When kids help prepare food, they are much more interested in tasting new recipes. After all, it’s their creation! Even the most complicated dishes include a few easy steps that can be completed by less-experienced sous chefs. Smoothies are great because most kids like fruit, and it’s easy to sneak in healthy ingredients like flaxseeds, green powders, and even the occasional vegetable. 2. Makeover your pantry with healthy alternatives
Make sure you read labels and get rid of anything that contains hydrogenated oil or high fructose corn syrup. These ingredients receive a lot of negative press because research has linked them to obesity and other diseases. If either one is a main ingredient, it is a sure sign the food you’re about to eat is over processed. Replace regular ketchup with fruit-juice sweetened organic brands, try almond butter for a change, and look for jams that do not have any added sugar. Experiment with different organic, whole-grain breads until you find one your family likes. These small changes can make vast improvements in your family’s overall diet by lowering sugar intake and upping the fiber. 3. Snacks and treats are not the same thing
Snacks, like meals, are foods we eat to fuel our bodies with energy and nutrients. Treats are foods eaten occasionally just for the fun of it. Unfortunately, we don’t always notice the difference. Most kids are snacking on treats with no nutritional value, such as pretzels, chips, cookies, animal crackers, and candy. They should really be snacking on nutrient-dense foods such as raw fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Encourage healthier snacking by cutting up fresh fruit and vegetables so these items are ready-to-eat out of the fridge, and make sure good snacks are always more accessible than treats. 4. Teach kids to be smart about their food
This is the ultimate goal. When kids are small, it’s much easier to control what they are eating, but eventually they will be out in the real world where they will need to make their own choices. The best strategy is to lead by example and instill healthy habits early on. If eating right becomes second nature, it will be easier for kids to stick to healthy foods as they move through their teen years. "
MICHIGAN’S ANIMAL WELFARE REFORMS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/michigans-animal-welfare-reforms,"OCTOBER 17, 2009","Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm signed a bill on October 12 that ensures certain farm animals in her state will be able to stand up, lie down, turn around, and extend their limbs, instead of having to live in cruel, cramped conditions. Bill HB 5127 prohibits some of the most inhumane confinement of pregnant pigs, egg-laying chickens, and veal calves. In Michigan and in most other states across the country, these animals are held in small cages that do not allow free or natural movement, in order to increase the production of meat and eggs. Michigan will phase out gestation stalls for pigs and battery cages for chickens within 10 years, and veal crates will be eliminated within three years. This new legislation will affect many animals; Michigan has more than 10 million laying hens and roughly 100,000 breeding pigs. According to Paul Shapiro, senior director for the Humane Society of the United States, cage-free systems are not cruelty-free, but they are an important improvement. “Cage-free systems generally cause the animals significantly less suffering. For example, cage-free hens typically have more than twice the amount of space of caged hens, and they can walk, nest, perch, and spread their wings,” says Shapiro. The USDA does not have any national regulations that govern farm animal welfare. The Animal Welfare Act only applies to farm animals who are used for research, testing, teaching, or exhibition. As a result, the well-being of farm animals used for food varies at a state level. Florida was the first state to take a stand against factory farming in 2002, when voters amended the Florida constitution to eliminate gestation stalls for pregnant sows. While critics argued that this animal-husbandry issue was not appropriate for a constitutional amendment, 55 percent of Florida voters approved the measure. Thankfully, since 2002 the movement to end inhumane animal confinement has gained momentum. Michigan is the second state to ban battery cages for chickens, the fifth state to ban veal crates, and the seventh state to ban gestation stalls for pigs—in addition to Michigan and Florida, California, Arizona, Maine, Oregon, and Colorado have all passed laws addressing one or more of these practices. From grocery stores to fast-food giants, many food retailers have pledged to stop supporting these cruel farming practices. In 2007, Burger King, the second most popular burger chain in the US, announced it would increase its use of cage-free eggs and buy more of its pork from producers that do not use gestation crates. Wendy’s announced in May that it would start to use cage-free eggs. Safeway gives purchasing preference to producers that do not use battery cages or gestation stalls, and Whole Foods Markets and Trader Joe’s have also committed to using cage-free eggs in their stores. There are still many issues that need to be addressed, including the tail-docking of dairy cows, force-feeding of ducks for foie gras, and conventional poultry slaughter methods. Shapiro believes that the more people are aware about factory farming, the more things will change. “[Public education is] critical, especially the role of undercover videotaped exposés,” says Shapiro. “[These] give the public a glimpse into what life is really like for factory farmed animals in the US.” "
NATALIE PORTMAN AND VEGANISM,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/natalie-portman-and-veganism,"OCTOBER 16, 2009","It was recently speculated that longtime veg-actress Natalie Portman had swapped veganism for vegetarianism when she admitted she loved dairy ice cream in a recent interview. This week, Portman shared that she’s back to living a completely vegan lifestyle after reading Jonathan Safran Foer’s upcoming nonfiction work, Eating Animals. Foer, who explores his own personal ethical dilemmas in the book, sat down recently with Larry King and Food Network personality Anthony Bourdain to discuss factory farming. The topics discussed on the Larry King Live show that night centered on the controversy surrounding The New York Times article that exposed the horrors of the meat industry. "

BATTLING PRESCHOOL OBESITY,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/battling-preschool-obesity,"OCTOBER 15, 2009","These days, healthy (and veg-friendly) school lunch options are becoming more available in elementary school lunchrooms and university dining halls in an effort to combat America’s obesity epidemic. While these steps are important, studies show that almost one in five four-year-olds are already obese before entering kindergarten. New research from Harvard says that child-care providers are a contributing factor to this problem, because few states have laws that regulate nutrition and physical activity for preschool-age children. With nearly half of children aged two to five in formal daycare centers, nutritionists are petitioning Congress to address this issue when it prepares to reauthorize the Child Nutrition Act later this year.

DIABETES RISK REDUCED,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/diabetes-risk-reduced,"OCTOBER 15, 2009","Living in healthy neighborhoods may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by 38 percent, according to a report published in the October 12 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine. Researchers from the Drexel University School of Public Health determined the health of three different neighborhoods by rating their accessibility to fruits and vegetables, whether it was enjoyable to walk in the neighborhood, and other criteria conducive to a healthy lifestyle. They followed 2,285 people in these neighborhoods for five years and found that areas with healthier environmental features had a 38 percent lower incidence of type 2 diabetes. The report concluded that improving these factors through public policy could successfully combat the diabetes epidemic in the US. "

IHOP’S INHUMANE EGGS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/ihops-inhumane-eggs,"OCTOBER 14, 2009","The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) is accusing the International House of Pancakes (IHOP) of false advertising because it claims to use “cruelty-free” eggs in its omelets and pancakes. HSUS filed complaints against the restaurant chain Wednesday, saying that IHOP is lying to consumers about the living conditions of its egg supplier’s chickens. The animal-welfare group petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to halt the chain’s claim of “cruelty-free” because it is misleading. IHOP has always claimed that the chickens that lay its eggs receive “dignified, humane treatment.” IHOP declined to comment on the allegations. "
INDUSTRIAL HEMP FARMING,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/industrial-hemp-farming,"OCTOBER 14, 2009"," Kentucky senator Joey Pendleton introduced a bill to legalize the industrial farming of hemp in his state, citing its use as a cash crop and an alternative fuel source. Industrial hemp farming is banned under federal law, but there is currently legislation in Congress to decriminalize it. It is already legal for research purposes in Kentucky and seven other states. The hemp plant is considered a controlled substance because it is related to marijuana, but proponents say the type of hemp used in industrial farming does not contain enough THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) to be used as a drug. While hemp products are sold in the US, including auto fuels, paper, clothing, cosmetics, and carpets, they must all be imported. "
TV ENERGY STANDARDS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/tv-energy-standards,"OCTOBER 14, 2009","The California Energy Commission wants to introduce the first energy-efficiency requirements for flat screen TVs. The proposed energy consumption standard for televisions would be phased in over two years, starting January 2011. The Consumer Electronics Association opposes the rules and says people should decide for themselves whether they want to buy an efficient television, claiming restrictions will limit innovation and consumer satisfaction. However, the Energy Commission likens its regulations to the new energy standards for refrigerators and air conditioners, which have not caused any problems. The Energy Commission estimates that TVs and related devices are responsible for 10 percent of household electricity consumption in California. "
LARRY KING BEEF DEBATE,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/larry-king-beef-debate,"OCTOBER 13, 2009","On his show Monday night, Larry King held a spirited discussion about the dangers of eating meat in light of The New York Times’ front-page article about Stephanie Smith’s paralysis from an E. coli-infected hamburger. Patrick Boyle, president and CEO of the American Meat Institute, said E. coli most likely will never be eliminated from raw meat, but incidence rates of the bacteria are generally low and outbreaks can be eradicated through proper cooking practices. However, Bill Marler, Smith’s lawyer and an expert on foodborne illness litigation, said cooking and handling ground meat is difficult, which is why these high-profile infections occur. Dr. T. Colin Campbell, co-author of The China Study, argued “the closer we get to a whole foods, plant-based diet, the healthier we are going to be on all accounts.” "
CA ANIMAL PROTECTION BILLS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/ca-animal-protection-bills,"OCTOBER 13, 2009","Earlier this week, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed four animal-rights measures passed this session by the California State Legislature and vetoed three. Seven of the 700 measures passed this session were related to animal protection and involved controversial issues such as the tail docking of dairy cows and harsher punishments for dog fighting. While the ban on tail docking was signed through, three of the measures, including one to clean-up puppy mills, were vetoed. Governor Schwarzenegger, who was an outspoken opponent of Proposition 2 last fall, defended his decision to veto limitations on puppy mill on the grounds that it could criminalize pet shops and kennels.

Earlier this year, Morningstar announced it would reformulate the ingredients in two of its vegan—Griller Recipe Crumbles and Sausage Style Crumbles—over the summer to include milk and eggs. Representatives from Morningstar Farms did not confirm exactly when the transition occurred, only that these products are no longer vegan-friendly.

NYT PRESENTS VEG DILEMMA,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/nyt-presents-veg-dilemma,"OCTOBER 12, 2009","The New York Times Magazine featured one man’s journey toward vegetarianism in its “Food Issue” this past Sunday. In this piece, novelist Jonathan Safran Foer describes his off-again, on-again relationship with meat-eating, which persisted despite his own ethical reservations. But his inconsistent vegetarianism finally ended when he had children; at that moment, giving up meat became necessary in order to set a good example. He says, “My children not only inspired me to reconsider what kind of eating animal I would be, but also shamed me into reconsideration.” This article is adapted from Foer’s upcoming book, Eating Animals, which will be released in early November.

VEGGIE SPIDER DISCOVERED,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/veggie-spider-discovered,"OCTOBER 12, 2009","Of about 40,000 species the Bagheera kiplingi is the only one known to subsist on a plant-based diet. Recently discovered in South America, this species of jumping spider almost exclusively eats leaf buds, such as wild acacia plants. Before this discovery scientists believed that spiders could only eat food they trapped and externally digested. Unlike their arachnid brethren, Bagheera kiplingis’ vegetarian diet means they need to spin webs to catch prey. Instead, the herbivorous creatures focus their web-spinning energy on building family homes, which act as nests for their young. Another interesting divergence from other species of spider is that the Bagheera kiplingi does not eat its sexual partner after mating. "
VEGAN ROCK STARS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/vegan-rock-stars,"OCTOBER 12, 2009","Beastie Boys band member Adam Yauch recently announced to fans that he has adopted a vegan diet to help aid in his cancer recovery. While Yauch is the latest celebrity to go vegan, an entire crop of veg musicians—from the compassionate crooners to the punk-inspired politicos—are all singing the same tune: the praises of a meat-free lifestyle. Whether or not their lyrics reflect what goes on their plates, VN’s profiled musicians prove again and again that compassionate living rocks. Erykah Badu
Erykah Badu (pictured above) has more than her 20 years of vegetarianism to celebrate: Last year she released her fourth studio album, New Amerykah, Pt. 1: 4th World War, which sold more than 100,000 copies in its first week. The Texas-born-and-raised chanteuse is now gearing up to release her next album, tentatively titled New Amerykah, Pt. 2: Return of the Ankh. A longtime vegetarian, Badu has been happily living a vegan lifestyle for more than two years. For Badu, the motivation to choose to live a compassionate lifestyle was relatively straightforward. “I wouldn’t say it took any one big event, vegetarianism just always made sense to me. [What farmed animals] endure is just terrible. It’s horrible,” she says. Chrissie Hynde
To the music world she is a rock goddess whose powerful vocals fuel The Pretenders. Debuting onto the scene in 1980, The band has earned a wide and dedicated following, and in 2005 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Animal-rights activists know, however, that Hynde has dedicated her life to another passion as well—one she shares both on and off stage. She is an active member of PETA and was even arrested in 2003 for leading a protest against KFC in France. In 2007 she opened her own vegan restaurant, VegiTerranean, in her hometown of Akron, Ohio. Veg since her teens, Hynde uses her killer set of pipes to bring awareness to the plight of animals everywhere.

Moby
Grammy-nominated, platinum-selling artist Moby released his latest album Wait For Me last May—his 20th musical offering. The record is dialed down considerably from his more danceable 2008-studio album, Last Night. Known for his signature ambient, complex, and unmistakably urban sound, he is also an outspoken vegan. Turning out albums with candid, issue-driven liner notes and titles like “Animal Rights”, Moby uses music as a vehicle for both ethical and artistic expression. A practicing vegan for more than 20 years, Moby opened Teany, a veg-friendly teahouse, in 2002 in New York City. Davey Havok of AFI
It was no mistake that devoted PETA2 fans voted Davey Havok the World’s Sexiest Vegetarian in 2007. The AFI front man has been rocking and advocating cruelty-free living for more than 10 years. In a video for PETA2, Havok described his veganism as love and respect for animals and for himself: “As human beings we are not meant to consume animals, we are not meant to consume animal products.” A further testament to Havok’s passion for compassion is his vegan clothing line, Zu Boutique. While some T-shirt slogans kill with kindness—one depicts a cartoon rabbit covered in animal-tested make-up—while others take a more straightforward approach. Last month AFI released Crash Love, their eighth studio album, which entered Billboard’s Top 200 at number 12. "

The study looked at 5,300 women who gave birth in four separate hospitals and noticed that those with higher blood levels of specific carotenoids were not as likely to give birth prematurely. Carotenoids are antioxidants that give produce a yellow, orange, or red color. They are found in tomatoes, carrots, peppers, watermelon, and oranges. According to researchers, it is too early to be sure that carotenoids have a significant positive effect by themselves, but the findings fit with current advice that pregnant women should eat a variety of fruits and vegetables.

HALLOWEEN HOW-TO,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/halloween-how-to,"OCTOBER 11, 2009"," The season of spook is upon us! Here’s our handy run-down of everything you’ll need to scare your neighbors, keep your dentist in business for the next year, and give Jack (last name: O’Lantern) a truly terrifying lobotomy/facelift combo. Eco-conscious Costumes
Halloween is the only day you can respectably take on a new identity, and with shiny new costumes beckoning from every storefront, it can be hard to resist the urge to splurge. But many store-bought costumes are not budget-friendly, and they are even worse for the environment. But that’s no longer an excuse not to celebrate in style. Be unique and make your own costume using ethical fabrics and recycled materials. Leftover cardboard boxes just need a fresh coat of paint to transform into anything from a robot, to dice, to a bag of popcorn. There are lots of kid-friendly ideas online. If you are lucky enough to have a sewing machine—or if you know someone who does—you can make your own custom costume. Some good places to find ethical fabrics, such as organic cotton and hemp, are NearSea Naturals, Organic Cotton Plus, and Hemp Traders. Check out nearby fabric stores or online retailers such as simplicity.com for Halloween-themed patterns. Anyone can wear something generic out of a bag, but a creative homemade ensemble is sure to spark envy. One way to curb consumerism this Halloween is to look through used clothing stores. It will require some searching, but inspiration awaits in all the retro-tacky clothing of decades past. Stores like Value Village and Goodwill are goldmines for old prom dresses, oversized suits, ‘80’s pop star attire, and loads of costume jewelry. Another possibility is to create a costume around items you already own. Just add a few choice accessories to an ordinary outfit and you are good to go, without spending a ton on something you won’t wear again. A crisp white shirt and vest becomes a flight attendant uniform with just a badge and a cute scarf. A tiara and sash can make a beauty queen out of a cocktail dress, and a sparkly white glove paired with skinny black pants makes an instant Michael Jackson. To wear your heart on your sleeve, literally, plan a costume that is veg- or environmentally-themed. Kids always look cute dressed up like some sort of fruit or vegetable—onion suit, anyone?—especially if they have a certified-organic sticker. Other green ideas for adults include Mother Nature, Go-Green Girl, or Al Gore. If all else fails, you can forgo a costume entirely and wear a statement tee instead. Happy costume hunting!

Leafy greens rank as the riskiest, mostly because of E. coli breakouts in 2006 caused by factory-farm runoff onto spinach. According to Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director of CSPI, meat and poultry were excluded from the list, because they are regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture, not the FDA.

POPULAR PET PIGS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/popular-pet-pigs,"OCTOBER 7, 2009","Pigs have become a trendy pet once again, now that they can be bred to stay small for life. Jane Croft breeds “micro pigs” full-time in Cambridgeshire, England, and demand for the tiny pets has increased exponentially. Croft appeared on Wednesday’s “Today” show with an armful of piglets, and said these animals are “really clean, highly intelligent, and just love to be loved,” which goes against the common belief that they are just food animals. Her pigs are a mixture of potbellied, Tamworth, Gloucester Old Spot, and Kune Kune varieties, and supposedly do not grow larger than a small spaniel. Actor Rupert Grint of Harry Potter fame bought two of the little pigs at $1,100 a pop. "
EMPTY BLADDERS SAVE FUEL,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/empty-bladders-save-fuel,"OCTOBER 7, 2009","Japanese Airline All Nippon Airways (ANA) is asking its passengers to use the restroom before take off in an effort to be more eco-friendly. ANA’s logic is that empty bladders lead to lighter passengers and lighter aircrafts, which allows the airline to use less fuel, cutting costs and helping the environment in one fell swoop. The experimental policy started on October 1 and will last for at least one month. If the strategy proves successful and is well-received by passengers, it could become permanent. ANA hopes to reduce its carbon emissions by five tons over this 30-day period. "
HEATHER MILLS’ VEGAN EATERY,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/heather-mills-vegan-eatery,"OCTOBER 6, 2009","This week, Heather Mills celebrated the grand opening of the first US location of VBites, her successful restaurant chain that debuted this past summer in the UK. The new restaurant is located in the Bronx, a borough that Mills is no stranger to. Last year, she donated $1 million in food products to the children of Hunts Point in the South Bronx, when she held a veggie BBQ to welcome kids back to school. While this location’s menu is not yet availiable, items at the UK flagship include Sweet Potato Green Thai Curry and Soya Hawaiian burgers with pineapple and vegan ham and cheese.

GOURMET MAGAZINE FOLDS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/gourmet-magazine-folds,"OCTOBER 6, 2009","Condé Nast announced on Monday that they would stop the publication of Gourmet magazine, along with three other titles. Founded in 1941, Gourmet has captivated foodies and luxury chefs alike for almost 70 years. In 2007, Ruth Reichl, editor-in-chief of Gourmet, introduced a monthly vegetarian section to the magazine. In recent years, it has tackled a range of animal-rights issues, including the cruelty of shrimp and chicken farming. According to Condé Nast, Gourmet has dropped in sales, and maintains a smaller readership than its sister magazine, Bon Appétit. The November issue of Gourmet will mark its farewell. "
EASY CELL PHONE RECYCLING,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/easy-cell-phone-recycling,"OCTOBER 6, 2009","San Diego-based company EcoATM has developed a novel way to encourage consumers to recycle their old cell phones. The company’s Automated eCycling Station works like an ATM. A customer enters a cell phone into the kiosk, which uses cameras to determine the used phone’s value. Then it spits out a trade-up coupon for a new phone, or store credit to be used at the kiosk’s location. EcoATM announced last week that its electronics recycling machine was successful in its initial Omaha location, and it plans to launch machines in Seattle, Dallas, Boston, and San Diego before the end of this year, with a larger roll-out planned for 2010.

NY TIMES EXPOSES MEAT TRADE,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/ny-times-exposes-meat-trade,"OCTOBER 5, 2009","An article published Sunday in The New York Times details the risks of eating beef by documenting the tragic story of 22-year-old Stephanie Smith, who was left paralyzed from the waist down after eating an E. coli-tainted hamburger. Smith, a former children’s dance instructor, contracted the disease two years ago at a family barbecue. Within a week of eating the contaminated beef she was rushed to a local hospital, transferred to the Mayo Clinic due to intense seizures, and finally induced into a life-saving coma. When Smith awoke nine weeks later, she was paralyzed; the E. coli had devastated her nervous system. Cargill produced the tainted hamburger meat, and the article exposes the harsh reality of meat-production. "
BALTIMORE GOES MEAT-FREE,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/baltimore-goes-meat-free,"OCTOBER 5, 2009","About 80,000 students in Baltimore will have only vegetarian options for their Monday lunches. Baltimore City Public Schools is the first school system in the US to adopt Meatless Mondays. The American Meat Institute criticized this decision and said students should be able to choose to eat whatever they want. However, the initiative is garnering much praise elsewhere. PETA is giving the school system a Proggy Award for Most Progressive School District of 2009. The Meatless Monday campaign began in 2003, with the goal to reduce meat consumption by 15 percent to improve public health and the health of the planet. "
CHICKEN BREED SAVED?,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/chicken-breed-saved,"OCTOBER 5, 2009","The rare Chantecler chicken will be protected from extinction, but only so it can eventually be sent to slaughter. Once thought to be extinct, there are about 2,000 Chantecler chickens in the world, most living in the Canadian province of Quebec. Despite its heritage-animal status, Quebec’s egg and poultry producers plan to ensure the chickens’ survival by permitting 10 farms to raise the chickens for commercial use. The unique breed was created in the early 1900s to withstand harsh northern winters. Chantecler chickens were not profitable to produce for food in an era of specially-bred, fast-growing chickens, but farmers say there is now a market for birds that are not mass-produced. "

FACTORY FARMS NOT “NATURAL”,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/factory-farms-not-natural,"OCTOBER 4, 2009","The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is currently calling for public comment about its regulations for meat labeled as “natural” after Farm Sanctuary petitioned the organization to change its rules in 2007. Farm Sanctuary argues that most consumers think it is wrong and misleading to say meat is “natural” when the slaughtered animals are always confined indoors to live in metal cages with concrete floors. At present, the voluntary label “natural” can be used on a meat product if it has no artificial ingredients or added color, and it is minimally processed—there are no restrictions related to animal welfare. The USDA is accepting comments about this issue until November 13. "
WIC FRUIT & VEGGIE VOUCHERS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/wic-fruit-andamp-veggie-vouchers,"OCTOBER 4, 2009","The Los Angeles Times reported this week that fresh fruit and vegetables have been added to the list of foods subsidized by the federal government’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). This marks the first major change to the program since its founding in 1974. According to the article, eligible families will now receive $14 per month for produce alone. The modifications, instituted by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees WIC, will also allow recipients to use WIC funds for whole grains, canned beans, baby food, and tortillas. The USDA recommends that women eat at least two cups of fruit and vegetables per day. "
NAMED COWS GIVE MORE MILK,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/named-cows-give-more-milk,"OCTOBER 4, 2009","A UK study that proves cows with names produce more milk than their nameless counterparts won the Ig Nobel Prize, an award “honoring achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think.” Researchers at Newcastle University investigated how cows’ stress and fear affects their milk yields. They studied 516 UK dairy farmers and found when cows were called by their name and experienced personal attention, they had an average higher milk yield of approximately 260 liters compared to cows without names, confirming these animals obviously have feelings and are aware of their surroundings and personal care.

TV’S BIGGEST VEGETARIAN STARS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/tvs-biggest-vegetarian-stars,"OCTOBER 4, 2009","While TV characters tend to follow the status quo to appeal to the widest possible audience, vegetarianism has a definite presence on the television landscape. In no particular order, here are some favorite past and present veg characters to catch on the boob tube. Lisa Simpson: The Simpsons
Eight-year-old Lisa switched to vegetarianism after she went to a petting zoo with her family and fell in love with a cute little lamb. Kwik-E-Mart clerk Apu (who’s vegan!) introduced her to tofu dogs, and she’s been veg ever since, one of the few character changes that stuck in this long-running series. Angela Martin: The Office
A super-conservative cat lover and head of accounting at Dunder Mifflin, Angela proves that an animal-friendly lifestyle comes in all shapes, sizes, and political leanings. She can be a bit abrasive to her human co-workers, but her compassionate diet points to her softer side. Sara Sidle: CSI
This forensic scientist encounters dead bodies on a regular basis, but she couldn’t stand to see a dead pig used during a crime-solving experiment, and subsequently turned vegetarian. Sara is played by Jorja Fox, a vegan actress frequently nominated on PETA’s list of sexiest vegetarians. Mr. Spock: Star Trek
The rational, half-Vulcan Mr. Spock does not eat meat because “it is illogical to kill without reason.” The Vulcan race is non-violent and wants to preserve species, not destroy them. Leonard Nimoy portrayed Spock in the original series, and he can relate to his iconic character because he also avoids meat for a more harmonious, sustainable lifestyle. Robin Wood: Buffy the Vampire Slayer
A prominent person in the last season of this cult hit, the mysterious principal of Sunnydale High never elaborates on his veg-status, simply stating that he would never go to a burger joint because he is a vegetarian. Tall, dark, and handsome, his plant-based diet certainly didn’t hinder his vampire-killing abilities, or his chances of getting a date. Brenda Walsh: Beverly Hills: 90210
In the teen soap’s 100th episode, female lead Brenda Walsh becomes involved in animal rights after a dog she adopted, who survived medical testing, dies from cancer. She announces to her family that she is a vegetarian and tries to stop animal testing at her university. The Doctor: Doctor Who
The Doctor went vegetarian way back in 1985, after he encountered a carnivorous space alien who wanted to eat his human sidekick. At the end of their ordeal, the Doctor tells his female companion, “From now on, it’s a healthy vegetarian diet for the both of us.” Phoebe Buffay: Friends
The lovably flighty Phoebe was a long-time vegetarian, but she wasn’t perfect. When she inherited a vintage fur coat, she wore it a few times, before giving it away out of guilt. She also ate meat while pregnant, but only once her friend Joey promised to go veg so no additional animals would be killed. Despite these few missteps, Phoebe was an eco-conscious animal-lover throughout the show’s 10-year run. "
CARGILL MAKES VEGAN CHEESE,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/cargill-makes-vegan-cheese,"OCTOBER 2, 2009","It doesn’t sound like something many people would want on their pizza, but Lygomme ACH Optimum functional system, a non-dairy cheese, may soon become a staple ingredient in frozen pizzas. Comprised of three starches, the new cheese alternative is estimated by agriculture industry behemoth Cargill to be 200 percent more cost effective than its dairy counterparts. In addition to cost, Cargill lists performance and health as other new benefits. Already nominated for a food excellence award by Food Ingredients Europe 2009, the cheese is said to maintain the taste and appearance of dairy cheese, as well as mirror its ability to melt and shred. "
HISTORIC MEASURE PASSED,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/historic-measure-passed,"OCTOBER 1, 2009","Yesterday, the Michigan House of Representatives voted to pass landmark animal welfare legislation, after numerous negotiations between animal-rights groups and the state’s agriculture industry. Once signed by Governor Jennifer Granholm, the law will require egg-laying hens, breeding pigs, and veal calves be able to stand up, lie down, turn around, and extend their limbs, instead of being confined in cages that permit limited movement. The bill passed with a landslide vote of 36-0 in the Senate last month. Animal-rights groups across the country are praising Michigan for becoming the fifth state to ban veal crates and the second state to ban battery cages. "
VEGAN RECIPE ON ELLEN SHOW,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/vegan-recipe-on-ellen-show,"OCTOBER 1, 2009","Most people don’t have a personal vegan chef at their disposal, much less one who can whip up delicious tacos topped with Daiya cheese. For funny lady Ellen DeGeneres, this is just another Thursday. Yesterday, she invited Roberto Martin, her personal chef, onto The Ellen Show to help her cook her favorite meal: spicy vegan tacos. Layered with tons of veggies, Yves Meatless Taco Stuffers, Daiya cheese, and vegan sour cream, the tantalizing taco recipe is sure to convert—or at least pique the curiosity of—many an omnivore. DeGeneres has been a vocal vegan since her transition last winter, and often highlights vegan-friendly recipes on her show and website. "
NEW CHEMICAL REGULATIONS,https://vegnews.com/2009/10/new-chemical-regulations,"OCTOBER 1, 2009","This week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asked Congress to update the Toxic Substances Control Act so there are more stringent laws governing toxic chemicals. The EPA says the 32-year old legislation regulating toxic substances cannot protect the public from the more than 80,000 chemicals on the market. The organization is calling for new laws that require chemical manufacturers to provide the EPA with enough information so it can evaluate the products and take action when necessary. This legislation does not control pesticides or drugs, which are governed separately. It applies to common chemicals with potential risks, such as BPA—used in plastic drink containers—or perfluorinated chemicals, which are found in non-stick pots and pans. "
WORLD VEG DAY,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/world-veg-day,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2009","Today is World Vegetarian Day, so let your veg flag fly. Founded in 1977 by the North American Vegetarian Society (NAVS), World Veg Day kicks off Vegetarian Awareness Month, an educational campaign designed to spread the word about the ethical, environmental, and health benefits of a veg lifestyle. October 1 marks the beginning of a 30-day celebration, full of lectures, parties, potlucks, and festivals in North America and around the globe. Need some incentive to get involved? Anyone who has organized a fabulous event or outreach program can let NAVS know about it and win some amazing prizes. "
BOSTON VEGAN PIZZERIA OPENS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/boston-vegan-pizzeria-opens,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2009","Move over baked beans, because Boston is about to become the East Coast mecca for vegan pizza. Peace O’Pie, which opens today in Allston’s Union Square, is a vegan-owned and -operated gourmet pizza bistro. The impressive menu boasts a bevy of tasty eats, including cheesy Daiya breadsticks and on-the-go calzones. The menu’s main attraction is the mouthwatering selection of pizza options.

APPLE TELLS ALL,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/apple-tells-all,"SEPTEMBER 30, 2009","Apple recently launched a website with a complete analysis of its greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to provide full environmental disclosure to consumers and critics. The site details all emissions associated with its products—such as Mac computers, iPhones, and iPods—including the extraction of raw materials, manufacturing processes, transportation, and average consumer use. This move comes after previous criticism from Greenpeace about its use of toxic chemicals and its poor showings in environmental rankings. Apple says that its green data is unique, because it includes the greenhouse gas emissions produced after a product is purchased and used. This data assumes a four-year lifespan for Macs and a three-year lifespan for iPhones and iPods. "
DAIRY FARM FALLOUT,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/dairy-farm-fallout,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2009","Today, PETA released undercover footage depicting cruelty to dairy cows inside a Land O’Lakes supplier facility in Pennsylvania. The photos and video reveal filthy living conditions, abuse, and animal welfare violations. Some cows are in such failing health that they collapse and are left for dead. PETA reports that Land O’Lakes inspected the farm in June 2009 and noted some concerns, but did not follow up with them. Video also caught farm personnel electro-shocking and kicking sickly cows, and even jabbing one cow with a pocketknife. Those employees have since been charged with animal cruelty. In a response posted Tuesday afternoon, Land O’Lakes announced that it’s investigating the claims. "
NOT ENOUGH FRUIT AND VEG,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/not-enough-fruit-and-veg,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2009","Every state in the US is well below national targets for fruit and vegetable consumption, according to a new study published yesterday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the first report that studies fruit and vegetable intake on a state-by-state basis. The government-sanctioned Healthy People 2010 objectives aim for 75 percent of Americans to consume two or more servings of fruit and 50 percent of Americans to consume three or more servings of vegetables daily. However, the CDC study states that only 33 percent of adults eat enough fruit and 27 percent eat enough vegetables—the stats are even worse for teens. The report advises states to make healthy food more accessible in schools and grocery stores in order to increase consumption. "
BATTLING BAT DEATHS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/battling-bat-deaths,"SEPTEMBER 29, 2009","The University of Calgary recently released a study showing how to reduce bat deaths caused by wind turbines by up to 60 percent-without sacrificing energy. The research, published in the Journal of Wildlife Management, suggests slowing turbine blades during low-wind cycles to decrease bat mortality. Bats frequently die during their autumn migration from Canada and the northern US to the southern US and Mexico due to wind turbines. Unlike birds, bats’ respiratory systems cannot handle the sudden atmospheric changes in pressure caused by the machines. "
ANIMALS IN DANGER,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/animals-in-danger,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2009","According to research from the UK’s Met Office, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise after 2020, it is likely that global warming will wipe out many animal species by the end of the century. Met Office, working with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), reported at a special conference this month held at Oxford University that if temperature levels rise by up to 39 degrees as predicted by the study, half the world’s animal population faces extinction. If temperatures rise—in Africa temperatures could increase by up to 50 degrees—combined with decreased rainfall in many regions, there could be serious effects to food security, water availability, and general health of both animals and humans.

NO MORE FUEL SUBSIDIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/no-more-fuel-subsidies,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2009","The world’s largest economies collectively pledged to phase out subsidies for oil, coal, and other fossil fuels at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh last Friday. Subsidies to the tune of $300 billion are spent globally each year to support energy production, which contributes to global warming by artificially maintaining low energy prices and increasing the demand for fossil fuels. If these subsidies are eliminated by 2020, it will mean a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. While environmentalists praised the decision, the G20 did not advance any plans to give developing nations the financial aid they require to switch to more sustainable economies. "
EARTH-FRIENDLY RACE CAR,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/earth-friendly-race-car,"SEPTEMBER 28, 2009","The first environmentally conscious Formula 3 race car will debut at the Formula Ford Festival on October 17 in the UK. The car, created by researchers at Warwick University and used by the WorldFirst racing team, is almost entirely constructed from recycled materials, including derivatives of carrots and potatoes. Instead of harmful fossil fuels, it runs on bioethanol and vegetable oil. WorldFirst team member Steve Maggs said that the car could either perform poorly or blow away the competition. If it comes in first place, the car could start a trend toward eco-friendly racing, especially since this sport is already feeling the pressure to go green. "
VEGGIE SANDWICH WINS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/veggie-sandwich-wins,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2009","The grand-prize winning sandwich at the second annual Mezzetta Make That Sandwich contest has been announced—and it’s vegetarian! Ninette Holbrook of Orlando, Fla., took home the top honor for her open-faced, wine-braised fig and caramelized onion sandwich, beating the other two finalists, which both used meat. Mezzetta, a producer of peppers and olives, awards its grand-prize winners with $25,000 and a culinary trip and tour of Napa Valley. For Holbrook, who had never previously entered a cooking contest, it has been a whirlwind experience. While in California, she says that eating at famed veg-friendly restaurant The French Laundry is a top priority. "
EPA TAX DENIED,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/epa-tax-denied,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2009","A condition was added Thursday to the Interior and Environment Appropriations Bill to preempt the taxing of cattle. Fear arose among American livestock producers after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared methane a hazard, as cattle are a major source of methane gas. Republican senator John Thune has spoken out against the prospect of a “cow tax” for more than a year, and addressed the issue on Thursday during Senate debates. According to EPA estimates, cattle produce approximately 5.5 million metric tons of methane per year, comprising 20 percent of US methane emissions. Thune called the condition “a great victory for South Dakota’s livestock producers and our rural economy.” "
HEALTHY VENDING SNACKS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/healthy-vending-snacks,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2009","Del Monte Fresh Produce Company unveiled a new line of fresh fruit and vegetable vending machine snacks last week, in an attempt to provide healthy alternatives to the usual chips and candy bars. The snacks include bananas, pineapple chunks, apple slices, baby carrots, celery, and tomatoes. The produce is specially packaged to remain fresh for up to a week in refrigerated vending machines, and prices range from $1 to $2.25. At first, these products will only be sold in the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast, but the line will become more widely available in early 2010. The company said they were responding to consumer demand for more accessible, healthy snacks amidst growing concerns about obesity and health. "
CERTIFIED VEGAN LABEL LOWDOWN,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/certified-vegan-label-lowdown,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2009","Wondering if your whole-wheat tortillas are vegan? If the ingredients list contains words you can’t pronounce, one easy way to make sure animal-derived substances aren’t sneaking into your snacking is to familiarize yourself with this handy list of food certifications.

Vegan
There are several organizations that offer credible, comprehensive lists of vegan certified companies and products. Vegan Action is a nonprofit organization that has, for the last 10 years, compiled a comprehensive list of vegan certified products through their Vegan Certification Campaign. Their simple logo, a circle with a heart, reads “Certified Vegan.” Vegan Action has also appealed to humane organizations to go vegan with their Humane Outreach Campaign. The American Vegetarian Association (AVA) logo is another great resource for uncertain consumers. While AVA don’t offer a list of certified vegan companies or products, the AVA logo on any product is one of the most trusted verifiers around. In order for a company to slap AVA’s orange triangle logo on their product, they must first submit a package of information for advisory board approval to insure legitimacy. It’s a good idea to look closely at the logo though, as the AVA do distinguish between vegetarian and vegan food items. Then there is UK-based organization The Vegan Society. Founded in 1944, The Vegan Society has been offering information, support, and a community for vegans for over fifty years. Their website offers a list of vegan certified companies they’ve approved, and is the most trusted certifier of vegan products worldwide. Their classic logo, with its flower stemming from the letter “V” is a standard and easy to locate (and trust!) on any grocery shelf item.

Pareve
A less familiar logo on many food items comes in the form of either a large letter “P” or “U” and usually indicates that a product is pareve certified. A Jewish dietary law separate from kosher foods, pareve indicates that a product contains no meat or milk. Pareve products can still include, among other things, fish, eggs, fruit, vegetables and non-organic foods. So while some pareve products may be unintentionally vegan, the pareve logo is no guarantee.

Cruelty-Free
Both Vegan Action and The Vegan Society maintain that in order to certify a product or company as vegan that they must also adhere to cruelty-free practices. If there’s no logo on a product, there’s a solution for those curious whether a non-food item is cruelty-free. Caring Consumer, a project by PETA, offers consumers an easy-to-navigate search engine of companies and products that do not test on animals. Broken down into categories such as skin care or household items, this search engine is the perfect outlet for ensuring that compassionate living extends beyond food choice for a truly cruelty-free way of life.

VEGAN MOFO RETURNS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/vegan-mofo-returns,"SEPTEMBER 27, 2009","If there’s one things vegans love, it’s food. If there are two things vegans love, they are food, and blogging about said food. VN caught up with Isa Chandra Moskowitz—author, blogger, and activist—about Vegan MoFo (Vegan Month of Food), a yearly celebration of culinary creations that challenges participants to blog about food every week day for the entire month of October, which Moskowitz modeled after NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month, held yearly in November).

VegNews: What’s been the most surprising aspect of Vegan MoFo?
Isa Chandra Moskowitz: It’s always amazing to me how diverse people are in how they arrive at vegan cooking. I love hearing about everyone’s backgrounds and being astounded by, say, the daughter of a cattle rancher in Texas learning how to grill tofu. It’s really inspiring to hear about vegan options in Alaska or Brazil.

VN: What’s the craziest creation you’ve seen from a VMF participant?
ICM: The holiday ones are always pretty off the wall. It’s a good sign if an entry can make you smile ear to ear, and what stands out in my mind as the craziest are Susie’s Tofu Loaf, which was basically a glazed and stuffed loaf of homemade bread, that was pricked to look like turkey skin. I know! You have to see it to believe it. That was in 2007 when MoFo was in November. Now it’s in October and last year’s Halloween round-up had some fun stuff, my favorite were these mashed potato ghosts with the most ADORABLE gravy eyes and foreboding ghostly mouths from Wing It Vegan.

VN: How did VMF change last year from the first year?
ICM: I think people got more consistent and more confident and more fun. More everything that is good, I guess! I think people in general aren’t sure what to write about when we write about food. What’s going to be interesting? Will anyone care? Especially if you are vegan and so were never interested much in food writing because it’s got so much to do with meat. But you don’t have to be the best cook in the world to write about food. In fact, it’s probably better if you’re learning as you go because it’s more off the cuff. Yeah, if you write a cookbook you should be a great cook, but to blog about it I think that the most important thing is that you’ve got heart. Aww.

VN:  How many participants did each of the previous two years have, and how many do you expect this year?
ICM: The first one had less than a hundred. The second had a little over a hundred. This year there are well over 200 so far and we’ve got a week to go. I’m sure we’ll hit 300.

VN: Considering the success of the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale earlier this year, do you think that people are increasingly using blogs as a means of activism?
ICM: Oh, you mean baketivism? I just made that word up. I think that activism isn’t what you decide to do but how it affects people. So if someone says, I’m going to become an activist! I’m going to stand on a street corner and preach about veganism! And then they go ahead and do that but no one listens and no one becomes vegan, then is that activism? On the other hand, maybe there’s a girl in the middle of nowhere who loves animals and decided to bake vegan. And then people taste her cupcakes and are like “What the hell, I’ll go vegan, too.” Obviously I think the latter is more effective, but I guess people might not see it as activism.

VN: What’s your favorite aspect of VMF?
ICM: I love to read about food and I often have to turn to non-vegan sources to get my fix. During MoFo I’m basically in foodie heaven and I learn so much. With food, if you ever stop learning you may as well stop cooking. "
BRAD PITT AWARDED,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/brad-pitt-awarded,"SEPTEMBER 25, 2009","The US Green Building Council honored Brad Pitt for his eco-friendly housing project at Bill Clinton’s Global Initiative summit last Thursday. Pitt set up his organization, ”Make It Right,” in 2007, and built 13 houses in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. The homes all have green roofs, which reduce heating costs and keep things cool during the summer. The average monthly electricity bill for one such home is $35, and Pitt says the homes are no more expensive to build when compared to conventional methods. He hopes to build 150 houses by December 2010. "
COWBOY GOES VEG,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/cowboy-goes-veg,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2009","Cowboys and vegan diets don’t usually mix, but at least one cowboy is going veg in the national spotlight. Dr. Mehmet Oz, better known as “Dr. Oz” from his five-season stint on The Oprah Winfrey Show, challenged a cowboy named Rocco to switch to a virtually animal-free diet for four weeks in order to counteract his heart disease and diabetes. On an episode of his show that aired this week, Oz had Rocco try some vegetarian chili and seitan short ribs to see if he could feasibly make the switch, and Rocco was surprised to find them both delicious. Oz also urged his viewers to follow the challenge at home. Unfortunately, Oz’s four week plan eventually incorporates smaller portions of meat back into Rocco’s diet, but if a cowboy can change his meat-eating ways for three weeks, what’s to say he can’t do so forever?

POLL VALIDATES VEGGIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/poll-validates-veggies,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2009","This year, veganism has seen increased visibility in mainstream culture, from Ellen’s newly adopted plant-based diet to veggie-chomping sitcom characters. The Washington Times is reporting this week that over three percent of Americans consider themselves vegetarian, according to a 2009 Harris Interactive poll. The data shows that in regions such as the West, and among groups such as women, and young adults age 18 to 34, that percentage is actually higher. The article attributes the fast-growing number of new veggies to the public’s heightened awareness of animal cruelty, changing health priorities, and concern over sustainability and environmental impact.

DOCTOR ADVICE COLUMN,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/doctor-advice-column,"SEPTEMBER 24, 2009","For many teenagers, the transition to a veg lifestyle can be tough, especially if their parents are unfamiliar with or unsupportive of the change. That’s where Michael Greger, MD, comes in. An animal flu expert who specializes in clinical nutrition, Dr. Greger is the director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture for The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS). His new monthly advice column will appear on Humane Teen, the HSUS’s website for teens. Dr. Greger will field questions about a variety of topics ranging from health, diet, and nutrition to animal wellness issues. In his first column the do-good doctor tackles swine flu prevention. "
VIPS DINE VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/vips-dine-vegan,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2009","Midtown Manhattan was abuzz with world leaders and royalty on Monday night. Peter Chernin and Tom Freston hosted a celebration at famed vegan eatery Candle 79 to honor Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was also in attendance. The bash was held to recognize Bruni-Sarkozy’s work with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, an organization that raises money to prevent and treat these widespread, debilitating diseases. France’s first lady is adamantly fur-free as well. Also noshing on delectable veg cuisine was Queen Rania of Jordan, Christy Turlington, Charlie Rose, and VN contributor Kathy Freston. "
RELIGIOUS RITUAL KILLING,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/religious-ritual-killing,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2009","Kapparot is the century-old, perennially controversial ritual of slaughtering a chicken to atone for sins that is performed during Yom Kippur. Traditionally, a chicken is held above the head and swung around three times, to transfer sins to the fowl. It is then slaughtered and given to the poor as food. Many rabbis and Jewish scholars have renounced the practice, stressing that it is merely a custom, absent from the Torah and Talmud scriptures. It has also been called a violation of Jewish law, which prohibits unnecessary harm toward animals. This week, with Yom Kippur right around the corner, animal-rights groups Let the Animals Live and PETA are speaking out about the cruelty of kapparot, urging rabbis to explore cruelty-free alternatives, such as collecting money for charity. "
COURT TO CENSOR CRUELTY?,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/court-to-censor-cruelty,"SEPTEMBER 23, 2009","The US Supreme Court is going to decide in the next few weeks whether depictions of animal cruelty are protected under the first amendment. The specific issue involves two videos for sale by a Virginia pit bull breeder. One is about dogs hunting wild pigs, and the other depicts legal dog fighting in Japan. The defendant, Robert Stevens, claims that these videos fall under free speech, but animal-rights activists argue that commercial exploitation of animal cruelty should be outlawed completely. Free speech advocates worry that changing the law will set a precedent that could lead to unfair censorship, and media lawyers are concerned it will threaten books and films that depict bullfighting, hunting, or horrific conditions inside a slaughterhouse.

DECREASED CARBON DIOXIDE,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/decreased-carbon-dioxide,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2009","A report by the International Energy Agency predicts that global carbon emissions have dropped by 2.6 percent in 2009, which is the biggest drop in 40 years. Researchers attribute the decrease to the economic crisis, citing a slowdown in international industry and trade. Due to be released in November, the report’s findings could benefit political leaders as nations struggle to find a shared solution to climate change. World leaders met at the United Nations yesterday for a summit meeting to discuss ways to fight global warming. While reduced carbon emissions may be temporary, they can generate discussion regarding the limitation of carbon dioxide output in favor of cleaner fuels. "
EGYPT REGRETS SLAUGHTER,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/egypt-regrets-slaughter,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2009","Last spring, the global community found itself in hysterics over the H1N1—dubbed “swine flu”—virus. While the infection can only be passed from human to human, much fear was associated with pigs, especially in Egypt, where the government mandated that all the country’s pigs be slaughtered. Intended as a preventative measure, public health experts predicted that the slaughter would lead to nasty repercussions. The New York Times is reporting this week that the streets of Egypt are teeming with trash because the pigs who used to feed on organic waste are now absent. State officials in Cairo have since recognized how unnecessary and debilitating the slaughter was. "
BLUEFIN TUNA TROUBLES,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/bluefin-tuna-troubles,"SEPTEMBER 22, 2009","The EU rejected a measure this week that would have banned the fishing of bluefin tuna, a popular delicacy on the brink of extinction. The Mediterranean bloc, including France, Spain, and Italy, did not agree with even a temporary ban because of concerns it would harm their fishing industries. However, environmentalists argue that over fishing will eliminate the species altogether if no steps are taken to ensure its survival. The tuna caught in the Mediterranean is mostly exported to Japan, where it is used in sushi. Bluefin tuna generates big profits because it is so rare, and this leads fisherman to fish above and beyond legal quotas. "
FATTY FOODS AFFECT BRAIN,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/fatty-foods-affect-brain,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2009","Food that is high in animal fat confuses the brain and can cause you to eat too much, according to a study published in the September issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center concluded that the palmitic acid found in foods with saturated fat—such as beef and dairy products—quickly makes the brain resistant to signals from leptin and insulin, two weight-regulating hormones that tell the brain when the body is full. Without these signals it is easier to overeat, and this hormone resistance can last for up to three days. The research suggests that only fat containing palmitic acid has this effect, so plant-based fats such as olive oil are in the clear. "
COLLEGE DINING DILEMMA,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/college-dining-dilemma,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2009","Universities across the country are feeling the push for more vegetarian options in school dining halls and many have modified their menus to accommodate different diets. The Harvard Crimson newspaper released an editorial this week calling for the college to offer more veggie dining options. The open letter acknowledged that university dining services has taken positive steps to incorporate more veg alternatives, but ultimately they should expand the “volume and variety” of meal options offered. The staff also commends the Harvard Vegetarian Society for its activism, praising the organization for spreading a responsible message about food choice. "
GREEN RANKINGS RELEASED,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/green-rankings-released,"SEPTEMBER 21, 2009","Newsweek published a comprehensive survey this week that rates the environmental accountability of America’s 500 largest publicly traded companies. Hewlett-Packard took top honors for its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Dell, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, and IBM round out the top five. The rankings are based on a variety of criteria, including the company’s environmental impact, green policies, and reputation. Newsweek worked with KLD Research and Analytics, Trucost, and CorporateRegister.com to compile their data and develop a ratings system that could apply to a range of different industries. So who fared the worst? That would be Peabody Energy, a private-sector coal company. "
AUTHOR ABANDONS MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/author-abandons-meat,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2009","Earlier this month Margaret Atwood embarked on a promotional tour for her newest book, The Year of the Flood. The seven-country tour found Atwood displaced from both her home and her normal diet. Having taken a “veggie vow” with friends, Canada’s famed writer has chosen to abstain from red meat and poultry for the duration of her tour. Her other diet alteration has changed the way she starts her mornings—Atwood will only be drinking shade-grown, bird-friendly, organic coffee. Atwood documents her semi-veg transformation in her official tour blog. Along with promoting her novel, Atwood is using the tour as an outlet to raise money for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. "
SODA TAX DEBATE,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/soda-tax-debate,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2009","A paper released in the New England Journal of Medicine last week argues that soda and other sugary drinks should be taxed just like cigarettes and alcohol. The proposed national tax would affect regular soda, sports drinks, juices, and iced teas, but not diet soda. The paper’s research team, made up of doctors, scientists, and policy makers, said this tax could curb obesity and generate income for health care reform—a tax of one percent per ounce could generate $14.9 billion in its first year. Beverage companies are outraged by this idea, claiming that such a measure unfairly targets their products and does not adequately address the country’s obesity epidemic, with one Coca-Cola executive likening such a tax to the policies of the Soviet Union. "
ASIAN ANIMAL RIGHTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/asian-animal-rights,"SEPTEMBER 20, 2009","China introduced its first animal welfare laws on Friday after a decade of working with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), an animal-rights group based in the UK. The new draft legislation protects pets, captive wildlife, and lab animals, and regulates how farm animals should be raised and slaughtered. Currently, there are no rules that prohibit animal abuse, because only endangered species are protected under Chinese law. The RSPCA stresses that passing and enforcing this legislation will be a lengthy, ongoing process. The organization plans to introduce animal welfare programs into schools to change public perception regarding animal rights. "

VEGAN MOVIE SNACK(S) TIME,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/vegan-movie-snacks-time,"SEPTEMBER 19, 2009","Hungry vegans know better than to assume that any food is veg-friendly, and even simple ingredient queries sometime return uncertain answers. These movie theater snacks are tasty, readily available, and animal-by product free. King Corn
It’s the most traditional movie snack to munch on, and also the most sensory—from its scent that immediately entices, to its crisp, shamefully delicious taste, even down to the oily texture it leaves on gluttonous fingers. Movie theater popcorn offers none of the healthfulness that homemade air-popped corn can, but it’s the perfect occasional weekend treat. And, thankfully, it’s vegan-friendly. Don’t let the questionable, neon-colored “butter” topping deceive, because at national theater chains like AMC Theaters and Cinemark, popcorn is totally vegan. At AMC Theaters, they even pop gluten-free, trans-fat free popcorn kernels in coconut oil. Cinemark contend that the golden color of its popcorn is due to the beta-carotene-rich canola oil used to cook it. While most chains use similar ingredients in their popcorn, it’s always a good idea to ask if you’re not sure. Sweet Tooth
Where better than a dark movie theater to devour an entire box of candy? Extra points for finishing before the credits are through. Classic, vegan-friendly options include an array of “fruity” standards such as Dots, JuJuBees, and JujyFruits. Newer fare includes Skittles (veganized in early 2009), Swedish Fish, Twizzlers, and Sour Patch Kids. Most national chains should carry many of these options, and maybe something even sweeter. And according to Bob Shimmin, vice-president of food, beverage, and amusements for Cinemark, certain theater locations serve at least one or two flavors of vegan sorbet. Savor It
For some, savory snacks hands-down beat sweet treats. For vegans with saltier palettes, wonder on up to the concession stand and order a soft pretzel. At most national chains, including AMC Theaters, soft pretzels are a cruelty-free way to satisfy a salt fix. SuperPretzel pretzels are a popular—and totally vegan brand used at many theaters. If pretzels don’t do the trick, there is always a less exciting but equally savory tray of chips sans the nacho cheese. For a little extra kick ask the man behind the concession stand to add a healthy scoop of jalapeño peppers slices. Drink Tank
It’s no secret that soda fountains are vegan-friendly, always available, and very predictable. If no movie snacks sound appealing then at least splurge for a movie theater thirst quencher. While they may just be cups of frosty sugar, childhood favorites like Slushies and Icees offer tasty alternative snacks in the hotter summer months. Cool down with flavors like white cherry, blue raspberry, and orange dream. Many theaters also now offer more healthful options. At many Cinemark locations, patrons can choose from a variety of beverage options including Vitaminwater, Fuze, Tazo teas, and coffee. Smuggle Up While theaters do offer a surprising variety of options for vegans, almost none of them are healthy or ethical. For moviegoers that consider either or both of these things paramount to happy-snacking, the answer is clear: smuggle it past security. Healthier options like Popchips, Newman’s Own Organics pretzels, and Endangered Species Chocolate bars are available at most grocery stores. The plan is simple: think ahead, make purchases accordingly, dress for the occasion (two words: big pockets), sit back, and enjoy your movie snacks. "
VEGANISM ON TV,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/veganism-on-tv,"SEPTEMBER 18, 2009","Actor (and proud vegan!) Jason Schwartzman has a history of playing offbeat characters onscreen, and his most recent turn in the HBO series Bored to Death is no exception. Schwartzman plays Jonathan Ames, a Brooklyn-dwelling writer whose life and career are at a standstill. Unable to overcome writer’s block and recently left alone by a break up, Ames decides to moonlight as an unlicensed, for-hire private detective, advertising for clients on Craigslist. In the fourth episode, Parker Posey plays a vegan who elicits Schwartzman’s services. In the episode Ames says, “You know, we really should all be vegan,” but admits that he has yet to take that step: “I’m kind of a non-practicing vegan.” Check out the premier of Bored to Death tomorrow night on HBO.

FOIE GRAS FUMBLE,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/foie-gras-fumble,"SEPTEMBER 17, 2009","In French it means “fat liver”, but to vegetarians it means torture. Foie gras, a perennially controversial dish, is manufactured by extracting the livers of overfed factory-farmed geese. Foie gras opponent Roger Moore admitted to a London news outlet this week that he has attempted to remove foie gras from British department store Selfridges & Co., but his written appeals have been met with silence. The news outlet contacted Selfridges, who blamed the lack of response on an administrative error. When prompted for an official response, Selfridges said that they would continue to sell foie gras, because there is a high demand for it from consumers. "
CANCEROUS KFC,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/cancerous-kfc,"SEPTEMBER 17, 2009","The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) is gearing up to file a suit against fast-food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). The suit contends that the chain failed to warn consumers that its grilled chicken, recently added to the menu, contains a dangerous carcinogen. Independent laboratory tests commissioned by PCRM confirms that the grilled chicken contains PhIP, a chemical that can increase cancer risks even when consumed in modest amounts. The lawsuit, scheduled to be filed next week, claims that KFC is in violation of California’s public health law for withholding this information from the public. "
NASA TO CHANGE GEARS?,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/nasa-to-change-gears,"SEPTEMBER 17, 2009","Lori Garver, deputy administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), spoke Wednesday about NASA’s move to more environmental and earth-based concerns. Her speech at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Space 2009 conference comes during a transitional time for the organization—the future of manned space missions is up in the air and their budget is not expanding. The government wants to emphasize how NASA can address the needs of the nation, pointing to its ability to track climate change and natural disasters and build student interest in math and science. Garver did not offer any specific plans of action, but says NASA will earn the taxpayers’ trust with better communication about their value to the country. "
STATE IMPROVES STANDARDS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/state-improves-standards,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2009","In a landslide ruling, the Michigan House voted 87-20 on Wednesday to approve new care standards for farm animals. The measure would require farms in Michigan, a state that currently has no animal welfare laws, to phase in more humane living conditions for animals. The proposal, now headed to the Michigan Senate, would provide pregnant pigs, veal calves, and egg-laying hens enough cage room to turn around freely. Paul Shapiro, who oversees the Factory Farming Campaign for the Humane Society of the United States, says that the organization supports the bill and that “…stakeholders have reached a compromise agreement that, if enacted, will avert a ballot measure.” "
GREEN GROCERY POWER,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/green-grocery-power,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2009","Whole Foods, the Texas-based grocer known for its natural and organic products, announced this week that they have bought 776 million kilowatt hours in renewable energy credits from wind farms, which offsets 100 percent of their electricity use in North America. It is the largest purchase of renewable energy credits to date from a US retailer. To put it into perspective, this purchase is equivalent to taking 72,000 cars off the road for one year, or planting 3.6 million trees. The company says they are committed to connecting with the environmental concerns of their customers and also plan to triple the number of its stores that use solar panels for energy. "
VEGGIE DIVERSITY,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/veggie-diversity,"SEPTEMBER 16, 2009","Biological diversity is crucial to any species, and now there is no reason to think that vegetables are becoming too similar. Two scholars at the University of Georgia report that there has been no overall loss of vegetable diversity in the 20th century, contrary to conventional belief. They compared seed varieties in commercial catalogues from 1903 and 2004 and found that there were only 2.2 percent fewer seed types in the latter catalogue. Explanations for this continued diversity include preservationist efforts to maintain old seed categories, foreign seed imports, and the enthusiastic farmers who developed new varieties of plants. "
DUNKIN’ DONUTS DEBACLE,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/dunkin-donuts-debacle,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2009","Less than a month ago, animal-rights group Mercy For Animals released footage of inhumane conditions at egg hatchery Hy-line International. Yesterday, Compassion Over Killing (COK) published a video filmed at Michael Foods, a Dunkin’ Donuts egg supplier, during an undercover investigation in August. The graphic video documents the horrible conditions hens at the factory farm are subject to, including constrained confinement in wire battery cages. During routine checks, employees find scads of dead birds—some undetected for weeks and almost mummified—left rotting in cages with live, egg-producing hens. COK hopes that exposing these crimes will compel Dunkin’ Donuts to adopt more ethical standards. "
NEW SOY STUDIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/new-soy-studies,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2009","This week, two studies were reported at the annual American Society for Bone and Mineral Research meeting, which found that isoflavones in soybeans do not prevent bone loss in post-menopausal women. These placebo-controlled trials contradict previous research, including a 2005 Chinese study that suggested soy has positive effects on bone density when consumed regularly. The leader of one of the new studies, Dr. Lee Alekel, points out that her research only dealt with soy extracts, and says soy foods eaten over long periods of time could still help protect your bones, because they are low in fat and may possess other health benefits. "
METACOGNITION IN ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/metacognition-in-animals,"SEPTEMBER 15, 2009","It’s hardly news to animal lovers that humans aren’t the only intelligent creatures on earth. An article published in the September issue of the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences corroborates this long-held belief. The man behind the research, David Smith, PhD, says that the research group studied rats, pigeons, monkeys, apes, and a dolphin to evaluate their memory, perception, and food-concealment patterns. The research indicated that the monkeys, apes, and the dolphin (nicknamed Natua) all possessed conscious metacongnition, which according to Smith “rivals language and tool use in its potential to establish important continuities or discontinuities between human and animal minds.” "
STEVE-O GOES VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/steve-o-goes-vegan,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2009","Best known for his insane, daredevil stunts on MTV’s reality show “Jackass,” Stephen “Steve-O” Glover announced earlier this week that he has gone vegan. Glover recently appeared alongside Pamela Anderson in a controversial PETA ad campaign that disparaged wearing fur and leather. In a statement on his official website Glover says that he first tried out pescetarianism and still included fish in his diet. However, he says that for a little over a month he has adhered to a strictly vegan diet and has enjoyed “…making a project out of seeking out an extremely healthy diet of raw, organic, vegan foods.” "
SCHOOL LAMB SLAUGHTERED,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/school-lamb-slaughtered,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2009","A primary school in Kent, England, sent their pet lamb to a slaughterhouse on Monday, to the dismay of parents, animal rights groups, and the general public. Students at Lydd Primary School reared six-month-old Marcus, even feeding him by hand, as part of a program meant to educate children about farming. While treated like a class pet, Marcus was always supposed to be killed. Comedian Paul O’Grady offered to buy the lamb and give him sanctuary, but the school’s student council, made up of 14 seven to 11-year-olds, voted almost unanimously to slaughter the lamb and sell the meat to raise money to buy pigs. Hopefully Marcus’s controversial fate will make people realize where their meat actually comes from. "
INCREASING INTERSEX FISH,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/increasing-intersex-fish,"SEPTEMBER 14, 2009","A study conducted by The US Geological Survey found that many rivers in the US have high levels of fish with both male and female characteristics. The highest amount of feminized fish exists in the Mississippi river, where approximately 70 percent of male smallmouth bass have developed female traits. Possible causes for this phenomenon include hormone-disrupting chemicals that leak into the environment, such as estrogen from female contraceptives, pesticides, household cleaning compounds, and pharmaceuticals. In contrast, scientists did not find a single feminized fish in the Yukon river basin, which is located in Alaska. "
CHESAPEAKE BAY CLEANUP,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/chesapeake-bay-cleanup,"SEPTEMBER 13, 2009","The largest estuary in the United States is about to get a makeover. The federal government released plans on Thursday designed to reignite cleanup efforts in Chesapeake Bay, a 200-mile long watershed connected to six different states. Pollutants from farming and urban development have long plagued the area. Run-offs from livestock manure, fertilizer, and sewage increases the algae in the bay, which depletes underwater oxygen and creates “dead zones” where sea life cannot survive. Plans to purify the region began a quarter century ago, but little progress has been made because efforts were mainly voluntary with no federal oversight. The Environmental Protection Agency hopes to turn things around with aggressive federal involvement and penalties that hold guilty states accountable for their actions. "
WAYNE PACELLE SINGLED OUT,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/wayne-pacelle-singled-out,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2009","An article posted earlier this week on political news website Politico gives a rundown of the most successful and attractive personalities left in Washington—and at least one of them is vegan. The list describes Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States, to have, “Kennedy-esque looks to go along with his animal advocacy.” Pacelle, who has headed up the organization for five years, is a constant champion for animals.

AUSTRALIAN BAND CLOSURE IN MOSCOW HITS US,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/australian-band-closure-in-moscow-hits-us,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2009","Hailing from a land where Vegemite reigns supreme, the five-piece outfit Closure In Moscow has been jet-setting in celebration of this year’s album release, promoting First Temple with an international tour. Venturing through North America, band mates Chris DeCinque, Mansur Zennelli, Michael Barrett, Brad Kimber, and Beau McKee are igniting crowds everywhere with their spin on progressive rock. Compared to bands ranging from The Mars Volta to Coheed and Cambria, lead singer DeCinque is working tirelessly to spread their songs and sound as much as another important message: veganism. DeCinque recently took a break from his hectic life on the road to sit down with VN. VegNews: When did you decide to adopt a vegan lifestyle?
Chris DeCinque: About two years ago I decided it was time to make the change. I watched a few documentaries and did a lot of research. Once I was well informed, it didn’t really feel like a choice anymore—more like an imperative moral obligation. I try to inform as many people as I can that I meet about my lifestyle and the implications it has. I feel that if anyone with compassion is informed enough on the impact their dietary choices have, they will come to the same conclusion I did; it seems obvious. VN: How does the rest of the band react to your veganism?
CD: Our drummer Beau seems to be the most curious and often asks me a lot of questions, which is promising. He will even ask me to order whatever I get for him from time to time. I hope this leads to a second vegan in the band; I could really use a partner in crime! VN: What are your go-to foods when touring/traveling? What are your favorite veg foods back home?
CD: Bean burritos are my jam for sure. Also, pita with hummus and dried fruits are great. Back home in Australia you can’t go past vegan sesame prawn toast—to die for. It’s basically deep-fried batter stuffed with “prawn” filling and a layer of sesame seeds on top, cut into the shape of toast. Simple, but amazing. VN: Have you been to any notable veg restaurants in the US yet, or had a particularly awesome veg meal?
CD: Just went to an amazing all vegan place in Orlando called Ethos Vegan Kitchen and had their shepherd’s pie. That was quite delicious. Also loved Red Bamboo in New York. That place was incredible. VN: What differences have you encountered touring in the US as compared to Australia?
CD: The culture here seems to be very instant gratification, “Now, now, now.” Whatever is cheaper and quicker seems to be the go. The media here seems to be very fear-mongering also; a lot of people seem very disillusioned. As much as there are a lot more options for vegans here, it’s hard to find something without high fructose corn syrup! I’d never heard of it before I came here, but now it courses through my veins. VN: What’s in store for Closure in Moscow over the next year?
CD: A lot more touring! We get a few months back home over Christmas time which will be really nice, but apart from that we’ll be on the road back and forth between here and Australia. Fast Facts Tofu or seitan? Seitan Soy, rice, or hempmilk? Definitely soy. Favorite veggie restaurant? Enlightened Cuisine or Vegie Bar both in Melbourne. Amazing! Favorite meal to cook? Apple and strawberry crumble or any peanut butter based cake. Do you have a favorite vegan, celeb or otherwise? I’d have to say Donald Watson, the man who started it all! "
SEXY AT 70 WITH VEGAN MIMI KIRK,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/sexy-at-70-with-vegan-mimi-kirk,"SEPTEMBER 12, 2009","Famous for the celebrity-centered contest, PETA hosted another “Sexiest Vegetarian” competition in August, this time with slightly different participant criteria. Instead of fame as the foundation, entrants were your average sexy Americans—over 50 years old. Mimi Kirk, 70, took top honors in the women’s category and continues to prove that age is just a number and the veg lifestyle only gets better with time. Hailing from Ramona, Calif., Kirk has been vegetarian for nearly 40 years, and a raw-food vegan for the past year and a half. “I feel like I’m getting younger rather than older,” says Kirk. A fervent traveler now that she’s retired, Kirk took time out of her busy cross-country schedule to chat with VN about her fabulous life, family, and the perfect green smoothie. VegNews: What triggered your transition to veganism?
Mimi Kirk: I just couldn’t stand the inhumane treatment of animals. I’ve seen how cattle, pigs, and chickens are treated when they’re raised and when they take them to slaughter, unbelievably cruel. And on the health end, all the steroids and antibiotics that are forced into these animals are not good for humans to ingest. VN: How has a vegan diet benefited you personally, in health and otherwise? What is your approach to food beyond “no animal products?”
MK: I feel like I’m 20 years old. I was just getting sore joints and since going raw, I have no signs of anything. My blood pressure and cholesterol are normalized. I jump out of bed in the morning feeling amazing and don’t get tired like I used to around three or four in the afternoon. My philosophy is to eat as much living/raw food as I can—green drinks, fruits and vegetables, wheatgrass, Thai baby coconut water, nuts, and seeds. I do think vegetarians have to watch what they eat as they can have too much junk food. VN: How do you use up all of your abundant energy?
MK: Since I’m retired, my boyfriend and I travel quite a bit. We spent six weeks in Italy and currently are on a month-long trip around the country. And we spend time with family that comes to visit and friends. My grandchildren love to visit us. [I have] seven grandchildren with the oldest being 20 in November. I raised my children for many years as vegetarians; out of my four children, my two girls follow the raw/vegan lifestyle. One is 100 percent like me, and the other is almost there at 80 to 90 percent raw vegan.

VN: Has the award affected your day-to-day?
MK: First my Facebook grew from 100 to 800 friends, and is still growing. Really, I never thought I was old, but people seem to think that someone my age shouldn’t look or feel like I do. When they ask for my longevity secrets, I think, “Gee, I’m not that old, am I?”

VN: You’re a big fan of green smoothies. Care to share your favorite recipe?
MK No two are alike, that’s what’s so great. But one would be celery, cucumber, spinach, apple, goji berries, maca, and sometimes I put other fruit in like blueberries, banana, or whatever is in season. VN: What’s your personal philosophy in five words or less?
MK: Don’t eat animals, love them! The Many Careers of Mimi Kirk From Hollywood to home entertaining, Kirk has one of the most diverse, fun résumés around: Mary Tyler Moore’s stand-in for her 1970’s sitcom Appeared on “Star Trek” as a Native American hand maiden Designed Valerie Harper’s clothes for TV and film Operated a jewelry business Published and edited enviro paper The City Planet "
CRUELTY-FREE FASHION,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/cruelty-free-fashion,"SEPTEMBER 11, 2009","While fur is unfortunately still used in many fashion houses worldwide, there are some designers whose ethics dictate otherwise. World-renowned trendsetting designers such as Stella McCartney, Charlotte Ronson, and Betsey Johnson have decried its use, and now Victoria Barlett joins their ranks. Bartlett has joined forces with the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) to create awareness around this furry issue. Today, the HSUS will be sponsoring the debut of Bartlett’s Spring/Summer 2010 runway show. HSUS literature, buttons, and protest materials will be distributed to the crowd during the show. "
JENNY MCCARTHY GOES VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/jenny-mccarthy-goes-vegan,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2009","Comedian Jenny McCarthy shared during a taping of The Rachael Ray show that she is now vegan. The Rachael Ray show kicked off its fourth season by throwing a block party in Chicago’s Lakeview neighborhood, and McCarthy, who grew up in the Windy City, was invited to the program to discuss local eats and dietary issues with Ray. During their sit-down, McCarthy recommended that Ray try the sausage pizza at the famous Chicago pizzeria, Giordano’s, and in the same breath admitted that she is now vegan. McCarthy has been an outspoken vegetarian for several years, and has championed the health benefits of a gluten-free, dairy-free diet. Will her celebrity boyfriend Jim Carrey join Jenny in her newfound veganism? "
INNOVATIVE SOLAR POWER,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/innovative-solar-power,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2009","Researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia are working on new solar cell technology that could power everything from cars to iPods. The technology uses molded plastic, which is smaller and cheaper than the silicon panels used today. This versatility could lend itself to powering a variety of different contraptions. The plastics that currently cover electronic devices such as cell phones could feasibly power those same devices with solar energy in the near future. According to Associate Professor Paul Meredith, the technology could be commercially available in as soon as three years. The research team, made up of scientists from Australia and the United States, recently received a $2 million grant to work on this project. "
ELLEN ON IDOL,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/ellen-on-idol,"SEPTEMBER 10, 2009","Ellen DeGeneres—comedian, talk show host, and vegan extraordinaire—will replace Paula Abdul as the fourth judge on American Idol. Fox recently confirmed that she signed a five-year deal to join Simon, Randy, and Kara behind the judge’s table on the popular talent competition. Some fans are flabbergasted by the decision, saying she doesn’t have enough musical credibility and will take attention away from the contestants. However, other fans think she will offer a fresh voice to the long running show and bring in new viewers. Ellen is known to be a longtime lover of American Idol. This past season, she hosted each ousted contestant on her talk show, and invited the winner, Kris Allen, to perform. So what kind of judge will she be? Ellen said she definitely will not be mean, which will hopefully provide the necessary contrast to Simon Cowell’s snarky comments. "
POTBELLIED PIG BANNED,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/potbellied-pig-banned,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2009","Fayetteville’s city council did not pass a motion on Tuesday to allow an 8-year-old autistic boy to keep his pet potbellied pig, Loopey. In Fayetteville, NC, it is illegal to have livestock within city limits, but Lisa Pia and Bobby Tibbetts say that their son, Anthony, benefits greatly from his interaction with Loopey, and they urged the city to allow her to return to their home. Anthony’s family wanted to change the law to specifically allow potbellied pigs as pets, or to give the city manager authority to consider these cases on an individual basis. However, other citizens and council members were concerned about property value damage. On weekends, Anthony still goes to a ranch outside of town to visit Loopey, and his family says they will keep fighting for a more permanent reunion. "
PETA AD BANNED,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/peta-ad-banned,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2009","A bottle of Vermont maple syrup isn’t the only thing not making it past airport security these days. PETA’s newest ad campaign, Cruelty Doesn’t Fly, featuring spokeswoman Pamela Anderson, was pulled from New York City’s three airports today, which deemed the ad “too sexy.” In the video, Anderson, dressed as the Halloween version of a transportation security authority official, strips a leather belt off fellow PETA spokesperson Steve-O, and tears a fur coat off a woman escorted by another PETA celeb, Andy Dick. The racy footage also features a nude couple walking through security unfettered. Airport personnel claim that the ad could confuse and offend children and younger passengers. "
EGG INDUSTRY GUILTY,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/egg-industry-guilty,"SEPTEMBER 9, 2009","Hy-line International announced this week that policy violations have been found at its Spencer, Iowa hatchery after animal-rights group Mercy for Animals captured the atrocities on film. An audit conducted by an unnamed, independent third-party found that the undercover video did reveal practices that were in direct violation of the company’s animal welfare policy. Hy-line says that “corrective actions” are being taken to ensure that its standard operating procedures are enforced and adhered to. "
HOTLINE FOR VEGAN INMATES,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/hotline-for-vegan-inmates,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2009","A telephone hotline is now available for the estimated 800 vegan inmates in the UK to receive legal advice whenever their animal-friendly beliefs are threatened. Imprisoned vegans may use this service to avoid common jail jobs such as cleaning, farm labor, and kitchen duties, because they involve household products that may have been tested on animals. Critics say that criminals do not deserve this sort of special treatment, while proponents argue that similar allowances are made for inmates when something compromises their religious beliefs. The Vegan Prisoners Support Group has already successfully lobbied for UK inmates to have access to vegan food, toiletries, and cosmetics.  "
LASER LABELS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/laser-labels,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2009","Those annoying labels you have to peel off fruits and veggies may be a thing of the past. The Agricultural Research Service and scientists at the University of Florida are testing a new technique called “laser etching” that uses a laser instead of a sticker to label fruit. It makes tiny holes in the outer cells of the fruit, kind of like a tattoo needle, and appears to be completely safe. The laser also seals these holes automatically, so the produce would not be more vulnerable to decay or pathogens. Another benefit? These “tattoos” cannot be changed or removed, which is great news for consumers who want to be sure about where their produce actually comes from. "
VEGAN ATHLETES,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/vegan-athletes,"SEPTEMBER 8, 2009","No longer are peanuts and cracker jacks the only things veg-friendly about a sporting event. Many pro-athletes have gone vegan for health reasons, and as a result have seen an increase in their performance. Tony Gonzalez, tight end for the Atlanta Falcons recently said that adopting vegan principles has led to his major-league success. Since going veg, Gonzalez has broken two major records. Gonzalez, who also holds four NFL records, transitioned into veganism in 2007 after reading The China Study. Other vegan athletes include Prince Fielder, first basemen for the Milwaukee Brewers, and mixed martial arts fighter Mac Danzig. "
VEGGIE CAFÉ TURNS 111,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/veggie-cafe-turns-111,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2009","Opened in Zurich in 1898, Restaurant Hiltl has been owned and operated by the same German family for more than a century. The current proprietor, Rolf Hiltl, claims that vegetarianism has not only benefited his family financially, but has enriched their health as well. Hiltl, who took over the family business in 1998, says that his great grandfather lived to be 93. Loyal vegetarians and meateaters alike enjoy Hiltl’s extensive menu—the tofu schnitzel sounds particularly novel and tasty—and daily indulge in the restaurant’s impressive food bar, teeming with over 30 options. Hiltl says that while the ebb and flow of the economy-over, oh, the last 100 years-has changed, ethical eats are nothing new. "
VEGAN FASHION TAKEOVER,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/vegan-fashion-takeover,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2009","High-end vegan fashion is everywhere. From the runways—like Heather Mills’ recently launched recycled clothing line—to the glossy magazines—hello, Vanity Fair—vegan is the look this season. Naturally, we polled three of our favorite vegan designers to see what the fall holds for cruelty-free threads. Inder Bedi of Matt & Nat, Elizabeth Olsen of OlsenHaus, and Leanne Mai-ly Hilgart of Vaute Couture chatted with VN about materials, trends, and what’s coming next.   VegNews: Tell me about your Fall ‘09 line. What sets this line apart from your others? What was your inspiration for it?
Inder Bedi: We really pushed the eco angle even further for fall. All linings now are made from recycled water bottles that resemble faux suede. We also did two collections, one men’s [and] one women’s where the bags are made entirely from recycled materials except for the hardware. We’re really having a lot of fun interpreting recycled water bottles these days and trying to be as efficient as we can. [We] also launched a coated canvas collection that has a grungy chic feel to it.
Elizabeth Olsen: The inspiration was my childhood, the ‘70s, mixing the glamour with the connection to nature of the time. The metallic colors of bicycles, plus natural elements, cork, braids—think shiny blue tricycle meets macramé plant holder.
Leanne Mai-ly Hilgart: Fall is our official launch! I spent a full year of 80-hour weeks developing this line, including eight full months of fabric research, with a goal to develop vegan winter coats that were high weather protection and highly chic. They are also eco-conscious, ethically produced in Chicago, and artist and community inspired. As far as design inspiration, I love grace, elegance, and a bit of east-meets-west, inspired by childhood ballet class and my time modeling in Asia.   VN: Vegan fashion has been all over mainstream media recently. How has that affected your business?
IB: We sell to mainstream stores where even though both are important, fashion still comes before social responsibility. We have noticed a difference, however, in our online store.
EO: From not only stores and buyers, but also individuals who have been waiting for these products. I have been pushing for mainstream press since I started the company.
LH: A couple years back, there was a mainstream news clip about vegan fashion, specifically shoes and bags, and I’ll never forget, the host was so confused like, “Why would anyone want to wear vegan fashion?” Discouraging, but then [with] all of the mainstream media covering vegan fashion, plus brands like Victoria’s Secret using vegan ingredients and marketing their product lines as vegan—it’s all part of the momentum, the movement that a cruelty-free lifestyle is part of an intelligent, thoughtful person’s life   VN: With awareness of cruelty-free alternatives growing all the time, do you think consumers are shifting away from wanting leather, wool, and silk items, in the way that people have generally moved away from fur? Or are those materials still in high demand?
IB: Those materials are still in high demand. It has been become generally more acceptable to use synthetics, much more so than 10 or 15 years ago, as long as the look is there.
EO: It is a slow evolution, but I know people are more aware of the issue overall, making them self-conscious when wearing, buying, or eating an animal product. So that is really step one, realizing what you are actually doing and contributing to. It takes a while to change the perception of leather goods as luxury.
LH: Wool and silk, which are more considered “vegan” fabrics, are still extremely popular and the cruelty of these fabrics is not very widely known at this point. Wool and silk are actually still seen quite a bit in some designers’ collections which are considered “cruelty-free” (in their case, meaning leather- and fur-free) when we know that they are anything but. We are the first label to focus on developing wool alternatives that are actually as high style and weather protecting as the mainstream originals. As with leather and fur used to be widely seen as, wool and silk are very much considered luxury fabrics right now, and that’s why the alternatives I work with and develop must be equal or surpassing in style and function in addition to ethics.   VN: If you could dress one vegan celebrity and one non-vegan one, who would they be?
IB: Vegan, Natalie Portman. Non-vegan, Madonna—the more awareness the better!
EO: Emily Deschanel is just amazing, and for a non-vegan—but almost there—Cameron Diaz.
LH: I adore Ginnifer Goodwin, and she has just reserved her own Vaute coat! This made my month. Next, I would flip to dress Ellen. To steal the immortal words of Sting, “Every little thing she does is magic.” For non-vegan celebrity, Audrey Hepburn is my all-time favorite.   VN: How do you see vegan fashion changing in the next five years? What kinds of materials will be used, how will vegan companies appeal to mainstream customers, and what do you predict for future fashion weeks?
IB: More and more companies will come out with vegan collections, which will fuel the exploration and development of synthetics. For companies that are vegan to the core, we will have to appeal to mainstream audiences by showing they don’t have to sacrifice style to look fashionable, and also use the eco angle as veganism is also an environmental movement.
EO: I see acontinuation of what OlsenHaus is already doing: not sacrificing luxury, style, or trends in vegan goods. There will be many, many more companies starting to do this in all categories over the next five years. We are also using a 100 percent recycled material from old television sets to make some ballerina flats, which is like green on green. I think a lot more companies are working on using more recycled materials as well. I already know several very large brands that are researching a vegan option to add to their brand.
LH: In the past, wool and silk have been described as part of “cruelty-free” fashion collections. These are the next to go [as] my work continues, as leather and fur alternatives are definitely covered. Vegan fashion labels have begun to be developed concurrently as eco-conscious materials, and with ethical production, whether produced fair trade abroad or on a living wage locally. Ethics as a whole—animals, people, earth—will be a big part of top vegan labels, as not only does it just make sense, but conscientious customers demand it and won’t settle for any discrepancy. Top vegan companies are appealing to mainstream customers who want to make small changes that add up to a lot of good, collectively.   "
VEGAN FOOD OPTIONS AT US COLLEGES,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/vegan-food-options-at-us-colleges,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2009","It’s that time of year again: cue the homework, schoolbooks, and teachers’ dirty looks. A new semester has arrived, but don’t fret if you’re less than psyched for the return to academia. With the proper fuel—we’re talking plant-based proteins and dairy-free baked goods—Winter break will be here in a flash. Check out your dining hall’s website for a menu. The University of California at Berkeley, which has more than 250 vegan items rotating in its dining hall menu, offers vegan taquitos, fajitas made with Gardein, and tofu-tempeh stir-fry with braised bok choy. The University of Denver offers a couscous burger, grilled veggie wrap, and sweet and sour tofu. There’s really no excuse not to have a plant-based plethora of meals if you’re purchasing a meal plan. If veg is lacking, you should demand top-tier treats and eats, because it’s likely that you’re shelling out a good chunk of change to attend your school of choice. Josh Balk, outreach director for the Humane Society of the United States’ factory farming campaign, works with universities and students to get meat-free fare on the menu. His advice to students who want more vegan options is to approach the dining directors, see if they’re receptive, and suggest meat alternatives: “Meat alternatives allow dining services to dramatically increase the amount of vegan food offerings without requiring chefs to come up with new recipes.” It also helps to use statistics or polling data to build your case that there is a demand for plant-based alternatives. Balk says the best bet is to provide dining directors with a list of meat and dairy alternatives that can be used in recipes they’re already familiar with. The meat alternatives that chefs favor the most? Gardein and Tofurky top the list in Balk’s opinion. According to his experience with dining directors, “Gardein can simply be substituted for meat in any dish, effortlessly multiplying a dining operation’s vegetarian options.” With all the stress and new surroundings first-time college students experience, foods with familiar tastes and textures will be more comforting and inviting to new vegans and the veg curious. Some universities, such as Penn State and the University of Maryland, have responded to students’ outcry for conscientious cuisine by implementing vegetarian advisory boards. These panels consist of students and dining-services staff who discuss and taste test new veg foods. Sister Maureen Schrimpe from the University of Maryland says that the school’s advisory board scores news recipes and that they eventually opened “a truly vegan concept in [the] largest dining hall,” which is Sprouts—a section dedicated to meat- and dairy-free delectables. “We have many items and have ‘cross-over’ customers who also enjoy the concept,” Schrimpe says of Sprouts, which has become a very popular spot for students. How do chefs know if an option is working? Ida Shen, executive chef at UC Berkeley, looks no further than the compost bin to see what flies and what simply does not satisfy: “If we put something out and it gets good reviews or gets eaten up, we know we have a winner,” she says. Once new options are added, fortify the fact that there’s a demand for tasty veg food by promoting and then packing away the plant-based portions. Head chefs will be encouraged to add more veg foods if the goods are gobbled up right quick. "
BACK TO BOOKS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/back-to-books,"SEPTEMBER 7, 2009","The Accidental Vegan, first published in 2000 by Devra Gartenstein and largely revamped for this new edition, is the most recent in an ever-increasing cornucopia of vegan cookbooks by self-proclaimed non-vegan authors. While certainly a welcome sign of progress, at least this reviewer wonders when these caring, compassionate, enlightened chefs will embrace the philosophy fully; it’s not pleasant to leave a bad taste in one’s mouth, either gastronomically or spiritually. Thankfully, Gartenstein, owner of Seattle’s Patty Pan Grill, has the food down. Accidental is replete with tantalizing, tempting, and tasty recipes that make the most of familiar produce plus a well-stocked spice rack. The VegNews test kitchen dove into her mains and sides, sampling Dev’s Basic Curry (it belies its name) as well as Yam and Chard Curry (hearty and nutritious). We also couldn’t get enough of the Afghani Stew. Pulao, an East Indian rice-n-pea dish, might just alter the way you see the plain grain from now on; Cajun Greens will have you singing of New Orleans. Accidental’s recipes are straight forward, and the book ends with a worthy section on basic cooking techniques, though offers no photography, which would have been a welcome addition to its very colorful dishes. Published in 1997 under the title Lorna Sass’ Short-cut Vegetarian (yet “99-percent vegan”), fast-forward more than a decade, lose the minor amounts of dairy, and, much like changing a few ingredients in someone else’s recipe, voila, you have a (nearly) new cookbook. Short-cut Vegan is an unassuming treasure (soft cover, no photos) that grows on you for its content, sans bells and whistles. “Once upon a time I believed in cooking everything from scratch. Then life got in the way,” begins the author, sentiments anyone can understand. Sass has created a book that combines the best of home cooking with the crème of what’s now available to assist the single mom or student holding down two jobs: ingredients your grandmother would have wrinkled her nose at, such as canned beans and frozen veggies (all organic, of course). Her first two chapters, The Short-cut Vegan Kitchen and The Building Blocks of Short-cut Vegan Cooking, comprise about one-third of the book, offering “Ten Strategies for Short-cut Cooking”; staples to stock in your pantry, fridge, or freezer; and a slew of “basic” recipes plus helpful hints that will transform you into a quick-cook chef (sorry, Slow Food people). Finally, the recipes themselves deliver what they promise, many one-pot meals where you will have dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes. Short-cut Vegan successfully juxtaposes speed with both flavor and health, the happy middle ground between eating out (too much) and cooking from scratch (too infrequently). Its combination of simplicity with taste also bodes well for anyone new to the vegan lifestyle. "
HAPPIER COWS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/happier-cows,"SEPTEMBER 6, 2009","On September 3, the California Assembly “moo-ed” their approval for a bill outlawing the unnecessary tail docking of dairy cows. Proponents say this common practice, in which a cow’s tail is removed, is more hygienic, but animal-rights activists argue that it causes pain and distress and leaves cows vulnerable to insects. Tail docking is condemned by the American Veterinary Medical Association and is already illegal in several European countries. Now the bill just has to be approved by California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. This may be easier said than done, based on his lack of interest in this issue due to the ailing economy. "
BROCCOLI TO THE RESCUE,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/broccoli-to-the-rescue,"SEPTEMBER 5, 2009","It turns out that broccoli might be the most heart-healthy vegetable. Researchers at Imperial College London learned that a compound called sulforaphane, which has its highest levels in broccoli, might help prevent clogged arteries and reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. The chemical, which is also found in cauliflower and cabbage, activates a protective protein that is dormant in susceptible areas of the arteries. Scientists must continue their research to see if eating veggies is as effective as sulforaphane on its own, but it can’t hurt to break out the broccoli if you want to keep your arteries free and clear.

FUR FAUX PAS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/fur-faux-pas,"SEPTEMBER 4, 2009","At the height of their pop culture craze, most supermodels elect to use their celebrity for one good cause or another, and Naomi Campbell was no exception. In the late 1990s, PETA approached Campbell, along with four other models, to participate in an ad campaign. The ad read, “We’d rather go naked than wear fur,” and pictured the five models in barely-there poses. This week, however, Campbell’s ethics were questioned by PETA after photos of her modeling fur for designer Dennis Basso emerged. Campbell, who has made attempts to distance herself from PETA in the past, has yet to formally respond. "
FESTERING FISH FARMS,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/festering-fish-farms,"SEPTEMBER 3, 2009","A proposal to develop industrial-sized fish farms in the Gulf of Mexico was approved by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NAOO) on Thursday. The NAOO now plans to create a national policy to regulate offshore aquaculture. Proponents say these fish farms will be a safe way to provide the seafood that American consumers demand without relying on foreign imports. However, fishermen and environmentalists are both concerned about the resulting pollution and disease that could adversely affect the seawater and the wild fish native to the area. So what’s the best solution? Go veg and let the fish swim freely! "
OBAMAS ADOPT HEALTHY DIET,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/obamas-adopt-healthy-diet,"SEPTEMBER 3, 2009","It’s no secret that the first family has made healthy living a family priority, and in the second installment of the internally produced “Inside the White House,” Michelle Obama discusses the importance of a balanced, plant-based diet. The video, released earlier this week, chronicles the history of presidential gardening and provides an update on the garden spearheaded by Obama and White House chef Sam Kass. The project was inspired by the positive changes that Obama witnessed in her own family after switching from an unhealthy, convenience-driven diet to eating more whole foods. For Obama, the project is an important way to teach families the importance of balanced nutrition. "
THE COST OF GOING GREEN,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/the-cost-of-going-green,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2009","The United Nations estimates that developing nations will require foreign investments of $500–$600 billion each year for the next ten years in order to adapt to climate change without harming current infrastructure, according to a report released this week. The money will assist places like India, China, and Latin America switch to cleaner energy and grow drought-resistant crops so that they can continue to thrive, but with a sustainable, eco-friendly economy. This amount is significantly higher than the $21 billion currently spent each year by developed nations to help developing countries combat climate change. The report suggests a global carbon emissions tax of $50 per ton as one way to cover the hefty expense. "
HATCHERY HORROR STORY,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/hatchery-horror-story,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2009","For vegetarians, it is hardly news that the commercial egg industry subjects chickens to heart-wrenchingly inhumane conditions. An undercover video documenting such horrors has gained national attention after its release on Tuesday by animal-rights group, Mercy for Animals. The organization hired an investigator to record footage inside the Hy-line International hatchery, located in Spencer, Iowa. The video, which can be viewed in full at Mercy for Animals website, shows live male baby chickens being thrown from a conveyor belt into grinding machines.

CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUCTION,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/california-energy-auction,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2009","In search of green energy projects, California is hosting an auction. In reverse. On Thursday, August 27, the California Public Utilities Commission proposed a system in which a company with a green project offers to sell to one of California’s three large utilities at a lower rate than does its competitors. Known as a “reverse auction market,” this would allow pricing for solar projects that produce up to 20 megawatts in California and can be built within 18 months to be set by the state. By focusing on the investment rather than the price, a more competitive market is the goal. Let’s hope no one ever holds a dating “auction” in the same manner. "
SOY REDUCES CHOLESTEROL,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/soy-reduces-cholesterol,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2009"," Ah, the wonders of soy—that magic little bean makes for a good protein source, and now chalk another one up for the many health benefits it offers. A Journal of Nutrition study found that people with type 2 diabetes can lower their cholesterol levels with soy protein. LDL cholesterol was reduced in study participants who consumed soy protein, and it also reduced the ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol significantly when compared to participants who consumed milk protein. The study participants consisted of 29 adults with type 2 diabetes. This, combined with the fact that a vegan diet also helps with diabetes and definitely lowers cholesterol, is more than enough reason to ditch the meat and dairy. "
WIND POWER AND WILDLIFE,https://vegnews.com/2009/9/wind-power-and-wildlife,"SEPTEMBER 1, 2009","Already controversial for blemishing scenery and seaside hot spots, windmills are now being accused of damaging wildlife. Published in Nature Conservancy Magazine, this low-carbon energy producer may threaten rare bird species. The article projects that 80,000 square miles would be needed for a so-called “energy sprawl” by 2030. This may endanger species such as the prairie chicken, whose natural habitat tends to be in areas perfect for windmill construction. Experts propose that maps of wildlife, wind, and environmental data be created so that certain areas can be avoided and little harm will be done. This may be beneficial to both animals and the planet. "

VEGAN BAKING PERFECTED,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/vegan-baking-perfected,"AUGUST 31, 2009"," It’s happened: vegan baking has been perfected, and there are cookies and cakes out there to prove it. It’s also more widely available than it used to be. A recent article in the Miami Herald, which praises vegan baking and showcases successful vegan bakeries and their techniques, hits upon the fact that it’s delicious and nutritious—these decadent treats have no cholesterol. From Peace A’ Cake to BabyCakes NYC to David Kalas, the pastry chef at Sublime, the article presents a favorable survey and shows that vegan baking has arrived and is here to stay. "
FRUIT STAND STADIUM,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/fruit-stand-stadium,"AUGUST 31, 2009","Watching a baseball game just isn’t complete without a cap, a brew, and an apple. That’s right, an apple. Fans cruising for snacks at the new Yankee Stadium now have a natural, fresh, and delicious alternative to sugary Cracker Jacks and sodium-laden dogs. At Yankee Stadium’s fruit stand, ballparkers can grab nectarines, oranges, bananas, apples, and peaches, all for $1.50 each. At that price, you can afford to buy enough fruit to keep you crunching through several innings (your waistline won’t mind, either). Although the fruit isn’t all locally grown, the move to supply fans with fruit is certainly a homerun. "

Now the channel’s second-best performing series in network history, Whale Wars will make its next season premiere in summer 2010. Season two’s finale raked in 1.3 million viewers, thus making it the third-highest ranking cable network among the 25 to 54 age range at the 9pm slot.

This isn’t science fiction, but a major concern of the United Nations. Swine flu was recently discovered in turkeys on farms in Chile and the UN fears that poultry farms the world over could also become infected. The discovery was made last week and the birds have since been quarantined instead of killed but will eventually be slaughtered for food as they have been deemed safe to eat once they recover. "
HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND HOME DEPOT BUILD GREEN HOMES,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/habitat-for-humanity-and-home-depot-build-green-homes,"AUGUST 29, 2009"," Going green from the inside out is simple when it comes to eating a vegan diet, but costs can quickly add up when it comes to eco-friendly housing. Known around the globe for supplying homes for those in need, Habitat for Humanity International and The Home Depot Foundation are expanding their Partners in Sustainable Building program. VegNews caught up with Habitat for Humanity International’s Senior Director of US Operations, Mark Andrews, for the scoop on the nationwide project. VegNews: What are the details of the program? Mark Andrews: The Partners in Sustainable Building is a $30 million green building program that will provide funds, technical support, and training over a five-year period to help Habitat affiliates build 5,000 homes that meet Energy Star guidelines or a higher nationally recognized green-building standard. More than 120 Habitat affiliates across 45 states will be granted $3,000 for each home built to Energy Star standards and up to $5,000 for each home built to a higher green standard.    VN: How did Habitat for Humanity and Home Depot alliance come about?
MA: The Home Depot and Habitat for Humanity have worked together in many ways over the years, including individual store donations and new home builds completed locally by Home Depot store associates and various Habitat affiliate partnerships. There was a desire to create a formal partnership at the national level in the US, as Habitat for Humanity and the Home Depot believe that homeownership is the centerpiece of building a strong, stable community. VN: How did the first year of the program go?
MA: After a successful pilot program where a total of 263 sustainable homes were built with 128 at Energy Star and 135 at a higher regional or national green-building level, the national program was launched.  VN: Over the next five years, the program is projected to build 5,000 new homes that meet Energy Star standards. How do you build that many homes in just five years?
MA: Habitat for Humanity affiliates work with community groups and volunteers to build simple, decent homes. Habitat relies on donations of labor, building materials, and land to help keep the cost of the houses down. We’ve built more than 5,000 homes annually for the past several years. VN: The grants for affiliates are only $3,000 to $5,000. What’s the total cost of building a Habitat green home?
MA: The cost of Habitat for Humanity homes vary by affiliate due to material and land costs. Habitat houses are simple and affordable. They’re large enough for the homeowner family’s needs, but small enough to keep construction and maintenance costs to a minimum. Built with quality and locally available building materials, Habitat house designs reflect the local climate and culture. The labor of volunteers and partner families, efficient building methods, modest house sizes, and no-profit loans make it affordable for low-income families to purchase Habitat houses. The grant funds are designed to cover the incremental costs associated with the changes in building practices. VN: Who will be moving into the houses? What kind of communities will be served by this program?
MA: Low-income families in need of safe, decent, and affordable shelter apply to local Habitat affiliates. Habitat homeowners typically earn between 30 to 60 percent of the median income in their communities. The affiliates chosen for the program serve a variety of communities. "
VEGETARIAN SCHOOL LUNCHES: DREAM OR REALITY?,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/vegetarian-school-lunches-dream-or-reality,"AUGUST 29, 2009"," If the current trend continues, the days of iceberg lettuce lunches may soon be the distant past for US students. According to a recent US News & World Report, the public school system has seen a 40 percent increase in the number of vegetarian-friendly cafeterias since 2003—almost two out of three, according to the School Nutrition Association. The Association’s report also showed 20 percent of schools serving a vegan entrée option, mainly at the high school level. Considering the past negligence of the National School Lunch Program towards plant-based diets, the figures surprised and pleased many. While it’s an improvement, is it enough? This September, the Child Nutrition Act, which provides the guidelines for national school breakfast and lunch programs, is slated to go before Congress for its five-year revision. The reform, the results of which will influence the next five years, calls for activists across the country to speak out for change. Striving to improve the state of veg students’ dining options, as well as the health of all students, organizations such as the Physicians’ Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) are petitioning for change. The main goal of PCRM’s petition is guaranteeing a vegetarian and vegan entrée option at every meal. Currently, parents may request their student receive a meatless meal, but schools retain the right to decline the request due to finances or other factors. The same allowance and loophole exists for non-dairy milk. Cynthia Long, Director of the Child Nutrition Division at the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, released a memo August 13 mandating all students have a non-dairy milk option at their parents’ written request, at no additional cost. As long as the substitute meets the “fluid milk” nutritional guidelines—including adequate amounts of calcium, protein, and vitamins A and D—students can swap their cow’s milk for a carton of soymilk instead. “However, in some situations, cost may be a legitimate reason for declining to offer a milk substitute to a child with a medical or special dietary need,” writes Long. For many schools, cost is the overwhelming factor holding cafeterias back from a massive makeover. Gradually, more low-fat foods are working their way onto the menu, but economic conditions aren’t making change sustainable. Based on the current nutrition plan, schools receive $2.62 for each “free” school meal they provide, but production costs average $2.92. Ultimately, adding higher-quality foods will cause the price of production to rise with no additional compensation, keeping healthy foods at bay. In the past year, approximately 60 percent of schools have been forced to raise lunch prices to offset costs. To worsen the price predicament, healthier foods such as fruits and vegetables are largely ignored by government subsidies, meaning they aren’t provided to schools at low or no cost, unlike their animal-product adversaries. In 2005, the government spent $385 million on beef and cheese, most used for school lunches. Fruits and vegetables garnered $50 million. The juxtaposition of these figures sheds light on the fact that one in three people born in 2000 will develop diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While school lunches don’t exclusively determine the health of students, a daily balanced plant-based meal can make a significant impact. More than half of US children take their lunch in the cafeteria, equaling 28 million lunches each day. To remedy the ailing health of the School Lunch Program, PCRM’s multi-prong plan corrects the weak areas holding back healthy foods. Along with a daily veg option and non-dairy milk without parental consent, government subsidies would be redirected to include more fruits and vegetables, taking the pressure off schools to front rising costs.

BEER: THE HEALTH DRINK?,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/beer-the-health-drink,"AUGUST 29, 2009","Often the adult beverage of choice among party-going college students, ballpark-loving sports fans, and veggie-grilling barbecue masters, beer tends to get a bad rap. Beyond beer bellies, the brew is starting to receive recognition for something we all desire: healthier bones. According to a study published in the Nutrition Journal, women who regularly drank moderate amounts of beer were found to have better bone density than non-drinkers. As surprising as it sounds, of the 1,697 women studied, those who drank “lightly” to “moderately,” which is 280 grams or almost 10 ounces, have better results when their fingers were tested for bone density. Researchers chock the benefit up to phytoestrogens, hormone-like plant compounds, in the beer, rather than the alcohol itself, but need to conduct further research in order to make any declarative statement on the potential bone benefit. But a brew with potential bone benefits? That’s good news, indeed. You don’t have to crack one open and start guzzling immediately. In fact, publishers of the study don’t advise anyone to start drinking in an effort to prevent bone loss. But if you’d like to take advantage of your favorite bubbly beverage, read on to discover which of your favorite beers are vegan. According to Paul Cobet, director of the technical center at Anheuser-Busch, “Our beers are brewed around the world using water, yeast, barley malt, hops, and cereal grains (such as rice, corn, or sorghum). None of Anheuser-Busch brewed beers or other products contain any animal ingredients (such as milk, eggs, etc), or process aids such as isinglass or gelatin, except for three small-volume brands called Michelob Honey Lager, Michelob Honey Wheat, and Michelob Golden Honey Wheat, which use real honey.” America’s leading brewer, Anheuser-Busch manufactures such popular brands as Budweiser, Busch, Michelob, Beck’s, and Stella Artois to name a few. That means the array of vegan beer is far-reaching and easily available. Anheuser-Bush is even releasing two new vegan-friendly brews, Select 55, a 55-calorie beer, and Bud Light Golden Wheat later this year. If the Busch family doesn’t appeal to you, check your favorite beer on Barnivore.com. From Anchor Brewing Co. to Sierra Nevada to Blue Moon, there’s sure to be a pale ale to please your palette. And speaking of palettes, a key factor in enjoying a good brew is pairing it with good food as well. Herestobeer.com is brimming with suggestions for your favorite vegetable’s beermate. Who knew that butternut squash is complemented by an American light lager or Oktoberfest and contrasted with a blonde ale? And in case you’re wondering what to serve with that welcome-to-fall apple crisp, go for a pilsner or amber lager. Whether you’re toasting the start of a new season, still clinging on to the last essence of summer, or cheering to better bones, enjoy a cold one, responsibly. "
"INTERVIEW WITH DONALD WATSON, THE CREATOR OF “VEGAN”",https://vegnews.com/2009/8/interview-with-donald-watson-the-creator-of-vegan,"AUGUST 29, 2009","From the telephone and internet to faux meats and non-dairy ice cream, there are some inventions that leave you thinking, “How in the world did they come up with that?” Whether you’ve been vegan for years or are just toying with the idea, the word “vegan” can stir up many reactions. And it’s hard to believe that one man started it all. Donald Watson, the founder of England’s Vegan Society as well as the man who coined the word, “vegan,” was born September 2, 1910. As this year would mark the 99th birthday of the vegan visionary, we’d like to look back to 1995, when VN publisher Joe Connelly interviewed the whip-smart, perceptive, and wildly humorous Watson at his home in the UK. VegNews: How old were you when you became a vegetarian?
Donald Watson: At 14, I made a New Year’s resolution not to eat meat or fish again. I didn’t know another vegetarian in the town where I lived. And then in no time at all, my brother and sister became vegetarians. I seemed to be alright. We were not smokers and teetotalers—all three of us. VN: You and your late wife, Dorothy, came up with the term “vegan.” Tell me a little bit about what the thought process was.
DW: I think it was a… I won’t say a brain wave, because that’s crediting myself. VN: Well, you deserve the credit.
DW: Well, I don’t know that I do. I think it was one of those wisps of inspiration that comes [out of] thin air (chuckles) that just happened to hit me. (laughs) I thought, well “VEE-gan,” now that is a strong word. I had to tell them how to pronounce it. VN: Since the word vegetarian is pronounced with a soft “g,” why is it not pronounced “vej-AN”?
DW: Because my inspiration said “No!” It was to be “VEE-gan.” (laughs again) The emphasis on the first syllable. It caught on and the only criticism I ever had was from a very prominent chap in the vegetarian movement, Jon Wynne-Tyson. He didn’t like the word vegan. [He said] it sounded like inhabitants from another planet. VN: You were vegetarian for 20 years, then you decided to go vegan in the early 1940s. What made you go vegan?
DW: All our theories told us [that animal products] were obviously produced by cruelty. I knew how cow’s milk arrived at the doorstep. And where eggs came from. The argument of vegetarians, of course, was that in order to get the steak you had to kill an animal. Good logic. Same with fish. In order to get an egg or a glass of milk you hadn’t to kill an animal. True. For one egg or one glass of milk. [But] if you produce those dairy products on a massive scale so that most people eat them every day of their life, and in the case of milk, virtually every meal, then the theory isn’t true that you don’t have to kill an animal. You do have to kill animals. "
TOFU ON TOP CHEF,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/tofu-on-top-chef,"AUGUST 28, 2009"," Finally, tofu makes its debut on Top Chef. A vegan challenge presented itself during a recent elimination on the cooking show. The male contestants were to cook for a bride and her friends and family and the female contestants had to cook for the groom’s side. There just so happened to be a vegetarian amongst the bride’s crew and Top Chef contestant Hector created a winning dish with tofu that garnered much praise. It’s a very refreshing representation of veg food since Top Chef’s last foray into meat alternatives was very disheartening—a contestant was given the boot for making a seitan dish. How does one mess that up? Because, seriously, the wheat meat can’t be beat.   "
ONE-MINUTE FILM FESTIVAL,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/one-minute-film-festival,"AUGUST 27, 2009"," How does one save the world from climate change? That’s easy—go vegan! But can you convince meat-eaters to go vegan in only one minute? The international 1 Minute to Save the World competition wants to challenge filmmakers to record a video that’s less than one minute and is about how to combat climate change. The films will be judged on October 10 and the contest’s in-house team will choose 15 favorites. These 15, along with five films chosen by the public, will be viewed by a panel of judges with the winners being announced on October 30. So get to filming and editing, and don’t forget to include all the great veg options currently available—though, that would definitely take more than a minute’s time. "
WATERMELON WASTE FOR FUEL,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/watermelon-waste-for-fuel,"AUGUST 27, 2009","Memories of juice dripping down your arms from digging into those summertime watermelon wedges may be slightly altered. Researchers from the journal, Biotechnology for Biofuel, are positing that watermelon juice, combined with other feedstocks, may make for an eco-friendly ethanol biofuel. Growing watermelons specifically for this purpose is not in the plans, however. The report explains that 20 percent of each annual watermelon crop is left in fields because of odd shapes or bruises, and concentrating the juices two- to three-fold could serve as sole feedstock. These unwanted watermelons could be used for three different functions in ethanol biofuel production: as a promising feedstock supplement, a diluent, and as a nitrogen supplement. "
BEAUTY PACKAGING MAKEOVER,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/beauty-packaging-makeover,"AUGUST 27, 2009","Part of picking the perfect new perfume or face powder is getting to sort through gorgeous, elaborate packaging that peppers beauty counters. Unfortunately, all the excess décor not only wastes resources, but it also ends up in the trash and damaging the environment. Fully aware of this, France passed an act last month that would stop all beauty companies from using more packaging than necessary. This change would also nullify a “consumer acceptance” clause, which was originally created to allow luxury brands to have ornate packaging. As we’ve been told since we were wee ones, it’s all right. It’s what’s on the inside that counts. "
TUNA EXTINCT BY 2048,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/tuna-extinct-by-2048,"AUGUST 26, 2009"," People have been gobbling up sea life like there’s no tomorrow, and if it continues, several species will have no tomorrow, jeopardizing our ecosystem. Now Taiwan is the focus of a new Greenpeace campaign as they are the second-largest tuna-catching nation, and scientists fear that overfishing could lead to the extinction of tuna by 2048. Taiwan has been asked by Greenpeace and the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan to reduce its tuna catch by 50 percent. Other species such as bluefin, bigeye, and yellowfin tuna has been overfished for years, and the fishing industry is already experiencing the consequences. The world’s top tuna-catching nation is Japan, and Greenpeace is expected to make a similar demand of Japan soon. "
AFRICA’S CLIMATE CHANGE QUEST,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/africas-climate-change-quest,"AUGUST 26, 2009","We live in a time when countless goings-on in the world seem unfair, such as the use of animals as food. The situation in Africa is equally unfair and tragic. Seriously suffering due to climate change, yet being a country that lightly pollutes, Africa is trying to figure out how to make things better. Ministers from 10 African countries met Monday, August 24, to decide their stance on climate change demands for a UN conference to take place months from now. They are likely to ask wealthy countries to cut emissions by 40 percent by 2012, as well as ask for billions of dollars to compensate for the damage caused by global warming. African officials maintain that although they are looking to develop, they hope to avoid making the same environmental mistakes other countries have made. "
TYSON LOBBIES AGENCIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/tyson-lobbies-agencies,"AUGUST 26, 2009"," Ever wonder why the meat industry has so much sway when it comes to environmental and health issues? According to a recent disclosure report, Tyson Foods Inc., the largest meat producer in the nation, spent more than $637,884 in the second quarter to lobby on issues such as meat labeling and tax credits. The company lobbied Congress, the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, and Defense, Environmental Protection Agency, and the US Trade Representative as well as other agencies. And, surprise, Tyson Foods also lobbied on labor and immigration. Tyson Foods makes us want to morph into a certain Tyson of boxing fame and work to knock out the meat industry. "
BEES STOP BUZZING,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/bees-stop-buzzing,"AUGUST 25, 2009","The buzzing yellow-and-black species has been in danger for quite some time, and things are slowly getting better. According to the latest report from the British Beekeepers Association (BBKA), one-fifth of the bee population in the UK died last winter. Amazingly, this one-fifth is an improvement over the previous year’s deaths. In the winter of 2008, one-third of the honeybee population died. The slight improvement is attributed to the possibility of bees clustering together in especially chilly temperatures, thus helping them survive. Representatives from the BBKA seem frustrated, noting that this is nowhere near an acceptable level of deaths, and expressing the need for more research into the causes and remedies for honeybee deaths. As bees are pollinators for agriculture, the BBKA is right in saying that the deaths should not be taken lightly. "
CLIMATE CHANGE CROP DECLINE,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/climate-change-crop-decline,"AUGUST 25, 2009"," Just how much of a hit would corn, soybean, and cotton crops take in a rapid global warming scenario? New research from North Carolina State University that has been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that it could be massive. Agriculture and resource economist Michael Roberts and economist Dr. Wolfram Schenkler have found that each of these crops has a critical temperature threshold: 29°C for corn, 30°C for soybeans, and 32°C for cotton. This means that if a slower global warming should occur, these economist predict that crops could decline 30 to 46 percent, and if rapid global warming occurs, crops could decline 63 to 82 percent. Those are some pretty stark numbers, so keep encouraging your friends to go veg in order to stave off global warming! "
MILK’S CARBON FOOTPRINT,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/milks-carbon-footprint,"AUGUST 25, 2009"," Milk cartons in Tesco stores have some extra product information these days—the British supermarket chain has added a carbon dioxide emissions label to each pint. The emissions label displays the amount of emissions caused by its production, processing, and distribution. Tesco says that its pint of skimmed milk has a carbon footprint of 716 grams, and its whole milk has a carbon footprint of 916 grams. Now, what about the carbon footprint of its soymilk? Seeing that Tesco claims most emissions associated with milk originate from cows’ methane gas, it has to be significantly lower. Tesco, slap a carbon label on that soymilk so shoppers can compare and contrast. "
AUSSIE VEG MENU BOOSTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/aussie-veg-menu-boosts,"AUGUST 24, 2009","We’ve all been in this unpleasant situation before: You’re dining at a restaurant and the only veggie option is, well, lackluster to say the least. Limp iceberg lettuce salads are moving toward becoming a distant memory, according to a recent survey conducted by Restaurant and Catering Australia. Partnered with National Vegetarian Week, the survey found that of the food service businesses surveyed, 56 percent said they were whipping up more veg-friendly options than they have in years past. A third of those surveyed said 30 percent of main courses were vegetarian. Additionally, chefs reported being confident in their vegetarian cooking, proven with their own vegetarian menu creations. The Aussie restaurant scene sounds both delicious and brilliant. "
PRISONERS WIN VEGAN RIGHTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/prisoners-win-vegan-rights,"AUGUST 24, 2009","Gaining a right that not even all American school children have for cafeteria lunches, UK prisoners now have a right to vegan products. Thanks to a 15-year campaign by the Vegan Prisoners Support Group, prisoners will be able to order in vegan food and health products from Holland & Barrett and Honesty Cosmetics. Representatives of the Vegan Prisoners Support group wanted prisoners to be able to have soymilk, dairy-free yogurt, chocolate bars, soy-based protein, and vegan soap, shampoo, moisturizer, and toothpaste. To get the goods, all that prisoners have to do is place a mail-order request. It sounds like a fine way to repay a debt to society by not supporting unethical practices or adding to climate change. "
MAN ROASTS DOG,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/man-roasts-dog,"AUGUST 24, 2009"," Shockingly, it’s legal to kill a dog in New Zealand if the dog is slaughtered swiftly and painlessly. Paea Taufa chose to take advantage of this law and struck the family pit bull with a hammer and cut the dog’s throat after he decided that taking care of the dog was too much trouble. He then roasted and planned to eat the dog. Authorities say that the animal was killed humanely, and their conclusion has outraged animal rights activists. Brian Rudman, a commentator in the New Zealand Herald newspaper who praises Taufa for his actions, wrote that “the pit bull fraternity should be persuaded that their pets, once barbecued, are as delicious as crayfish or rare sirloin.” The same could be said about any species and begs the question of why some animals, sadly, are considered food and why others are considered companions—perhaps this debate will inspire New Zealanders to evaluate their diets. "
TOP ECO-FRIENDLY UNIVERSITIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/top-eco-friendly-universities,"AUGUST 23, 2009"," These days, students aren’t just concerned about an academic institution’s prestige, but they want to know about veg options and how eco-friendly the university is as well. The Sierra Club is equally concerned with the latter and has issued a report card based upon schools’ green credentials. The University of Colorado at Boulder came in first, with the University of Washington at Seattle coming in second and Middlebury College coming in third. The schools were rated in categories that included food, transportation, energy, and waste management. And of course, vegetarian meal options are available at all of the above, and cutting out the meat sure helps the environment as well. "
BOOSTER BROCCOLI,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/booster-broccoli,"AUGUST 23, 2009","Even though veggies are chock full of nutrients, Vital Vegetables in Australia decided to one-up nature. It has designed and just launched a broccoli to maximize healthy attributes that the vegetable already has. The broccoli, known as Booster Broccoli, contains the highest concentration of nutrients and has an enhanced antioxidant composition to make the nutrients easier to absorb. Developed over a period of six years by Victorian Department of Primary Industries scientists and Plant & Food Research New Zealand, the enhanced broccoli’s purpose is to help make Australians healthier. Perhaps the next big project should be to educate citizens about the sufficient nutrients provided by and health benefits of a veg diet. "
TIME GETS TRUTHFUL,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/time-gets-truthful,"AUGUST 23, 2009","There’s something that isn’t right about the cost of food, and a recent Time exposé by Bryan Walsh gets to the meat of the problem: the meat industry. Pulling in readers with imagery of pigs packed so closely together “their curly tails have been chopped off so they won’t bite one another,” Walsh explains that our industrial style of food production is making “food increasingly bad for us.” Walsh explores the cost of our food, saying that “not all food is equally inexpensive,” and supports this claim with evidence provided by an American Journal of Nutrition study. The study found that with one dollar, an American can buy 1,200 calories of potato chips versus only 250 calories of vegetables or 170 calories of fruit. Additionally, along with chemicals and corn taking the blame for America’s poor health and high obesity rate, Walsh discusses the “food industry’s degradation of animal life.” He discloses the confinement of thousands of animals kept in concentrated animal-feeding operations, moving on to say that these are beings and keeping them in such confinement has consequences. The bottom line of Walsh’s argument is decidedly simple, yet awakening: “But what we eat—how it’s raised and how it gets to us—has consequences that can’t be ignored any longer.” "
ALL ABOUT LACHANOPHOBIA: FEAR OF THE VEGETABLE,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/all-about-lachanophobia-fear-of-the-vegetable,"AUGUST 22, 2009"," It’s at the root of the word that we use to define our eating ethics. It supplies us with nourishment and good health, and yet, some people are truly terrified. The fear-inducing creature at fault? None other than the vegetable. Lachanophobia is the proper term by which to name one who is afraid of vegetables. Sure, the phobia sounds a bit ludicrous, but it’s no laughing matter. People who suffer from lachanophobia experience real symptoms at the mere sight of broccoli or bell peppers, ranging from nausea to shortness of breath. With nearly 30 percent of Americans being sensitive to the bitter taste of veggies and the inherent fussiness children have with green matter, the phobia is more common than you’d think. “I just can’t stand the taste of most vegetables,” says Karla Kane of Mountain View, Calif. “It’s the taste and texture. It makes me gag as soon as I put it in my mouth. I don’t even like things that have touched broccoli.” What’s a lachanophobe to do when empathy for animals overrules the fear of vegetables? These vegetarian vegetable haters often turn to sugary and starchy foods to fill their calorie quotas. “What usually happens is I make something like spaghetti for dinner, and then instead of making a vegetable to go with it, I just blow it off because I know I’m going to get all the satisfaction I need from the spaghetti,” says Barbara Michels of Sunnyvale, Calif. “In my dream world, someone would come up with a chain of restaurants called ‘The Lazy Vegetarian’ and they would have a huge array of healthy non-meat items. It would be cheap, and they would have one on every corner.” Because we haven’t achieved that dream world yet (getting closer, though!), and a lack of veggies in one’s life can be detrimental to anyone’s health, here are some delicious ways to turn those green gremlins into dreamy delectables: The Dip Trick: Raw carrots, red bell peppers, and celery are the perfect edible spoons to scoop hummus, salsa, and even vegan cream cheese directly into your mouth. The crunch plus the dip is addicting. To Market, To Market: There is no better way to find luscious, bursting-with-flavor fresh veggies than checking out your local farmers’ market. Free samples will win you over, too. Stealthy Sneaking: Steaming zucchini, onions, carrots, and eggplant before pureeing them into a zesty, rich soup is an easy way to mask an undesirable texture of raw or plainly cooked vegetables. Including raw greens like spinach, kale, or peas in a fruit smoothie also ups your veg quotient without a savory taste. Gimme Some Suga: Sweeter veggies such as peas, beets, yams, and squash are hard to resist when cooked correctly. Slice up a sweet tater and throw it in the oven; before you know it, you’ll be eating sweet potato fries faster than you can say “pass the ketchup.” Face the Facts: Researching just how beneficial that bunch of kale is may be the key to losing lachanophobia. As Sir Francis Bacon once wrote: “Knowledge is power.” "
PLASTIC BAG BAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/plastic-bag-ban,"AUGUST 21, 2009","With stores such as Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, and even your local Wal-Mart offering reusable grocery bags in lieu of environmentally harmful plastic bags, it’s somewhat surprising that all cities aren’t taking actions quite the way Mexico City is. Passed in March, the city’s local assembly voted to ban plastic bags, and to require all stores to have biodegradable bags in full supply. Businesses have a full year until penalties are enforced, which are undecided at the moment, but the effect officially took place Wednesday, August 19. Along with other US cities such as San Francisco and DC, Mexico City will be working hard to change consumer habits from not-so-eco to eco-savvy. "
MERCURY-CONTAMINATED FISH,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/mercury-contaminated-fish,"AUGUST 20, 2009","While mercury levels in fish have been a concern for some time, we haven’t known exactly how prominent mercury levels are in our scaly friends— until now. After testing fish from 291 bodies of water across the US, government scientists from the US Geological Survey found mercury in every single fish tested. That’s more than 1,000 fish that had some level of mercury in them, and a quarter of them had mercury levels that exceed the safe amount for consumption, as set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Stemming from this finding, the Interior Department says that mining operations are largely to blame, and that our country must protect our waterways. Protect your body while you’re at it, and cut out any pescetarian ways! "
WHITE-HOUSE FARMERS MARKET,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/white-house-farmers-market,"AUGUST 20, 2009","Michelle Obama’s green White House garden has been growing for months, and President Obama has plans to coincide with the veg growth. On Thursday, August 20, Obama discussed his thoughts on school lunches, child activity, and local food in an interactive health-care strategy meeting. Not only does the President recognize children’s current sedentary lifestyles and the need to change it, but he also comments on the nutritionally poor school lunches kids face in the cafeteria. “It’s French fries, tater tots, hot dogs, pizza,” he says. Obama suggests adding fruits and veggies into children’s diets by connecting local farmers with school districts, and having them deliver fresh produce regularly. For DC specifically, Obama is looking into setting up a farmers market directly outside the White House that will get locals, farmers, and, naturally, good health interconnected. "
LEMURS KILLED FOR MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/lemurs-killed-for-meat,"AUGUST 20, 2009"," The bushmeat trade is alive and well in Madagascar, no thanks to a recent coup. The absence of law and order has given poachers a window to kill lemurs and sell their meat to restaurant owners interested in serving new “delicacies.” It is suspected that the suspension of conservation aid is to blame for the killing spree of this threatened species, and Conservation International aims to garner awareness with the release of graphic photos of the smoked animals. Dr Russ Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International, fears that the poaching of lemurs will increase the demand for lemur meat and thus the illegal hunting of lemurs. The graphic photos are sure to stir those concerned into action to stop the slaughter. "
WHOLE FOODS’ FIGHT,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/whole-foods-fight,"AUGUST 19, 2009","Whether you love Whole Foods because it’s the only place you can find your favorite morning oat bran, or you dislike it for its sometimes sky-high prices, there is no doubt it serves as a health mecca for millions across the country. Co-founder and CEO John Mackey, however, thinks that Whole Foods can serve as a health-care option for all of America. In an op-ed written in the Wall Street Journal, Mackey shares his stance on the ObamaCare plan. As alternatives to the President’s plan, Mackey suggests removal of “legal obstacles that slow the creation of high-deductible health insurance and health savings accounts,” equalizing tax laws for employer-provided and individually owned health insurance, and among other facets, enact Medicare reform. Mackey’s bottom line is that instead of increasing government spending on health-care, America needs to focus on the core problem: our poor health. His solution to that is a plant-based, nutrient dense, and low-fat diet. In reaction to Mackey’s bold op-ed, many are boycotting Whole Foods while others argue that boycotting does nothing, and that Mackey is merely one man of the thousands who work for the market. With stores across the US, in Canada, and in the UK, it would take a whole lotta people to stop the Whole Foods force. "
ENDANGERED FOODS,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/endangered-foods,"AUGUST 19, 2009"," Vietnam’s taste for rare meat is endangering several species, and the solution is simple: switch to a plant-based diet. But when apples and other fruits and vegetables are endangered, how do you save them? By eating them, of course. About 1,600 varieties of apples were available in the US a century ago; now there are roughly 11 varieties that can be found in local grocery stores. Groups such as Slow Food Russian River, a Northern California chapter of Slow Food USA, is out to preserve the Gravenstein apple, which first arrived in California around 1790. Though it may seem easy enough to eradicate the apple issue, a UC Davis study suggests a negative affect of global warming on California agriculture, which happens to be home to the US’ most productive fruit-growing region. With animals going extinct and now fruit, we’re not sure what to think about them apples. "
BILLBOARD CONTROVERSY,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/billboard-controversy,"AUGUST 19, 2009"," A PETA billboard stationed in Jacksonville, Florida, with the tagline “Save the Whales. Lose the Blubber: Go Vegetarian” has sparked much controversy. Objectors to the ad have called it sexist, size-ist, and even speciesist. A protest against the billboard was held outside a bookstore in Portland on Wednesday where Ingrid Newkirk was signing books. The protesters claim that the billboard is demeaning to women and that it exploits their bodies. Newkirk disagrees and says that “women can do whatever they want with their bodies, and these protests are going back to the times when husbands and boyfriends told us to cover up. Now these other women are telling us to cover up, too.” PETA sure knows how to get attention, be it good or bad.   "
MEAT BANNED IN INDIA,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/meat-banned-in-india,"AUGUST 18, 2009"," Apparently, the Uttar Pradesh government made a big “mistake” by banning the sale of meat and the slaughter of animals for over a day. The Supreme Court–issued order was meant to ban the sale of meat for nine days to coincide with Paryushan Parva, a Jain festival, and began on Monday. Policemen enforced the order and shut down restaurants that serve meat and kept slaughterhouses and meat shops from opening on Tuesday morning. The order was withdrawn later on Tuesday—it turns out that the government had misinterpreted the 17-month-old Supreme Court order, and that it was only specific to Gujarat and Rajasthan and not the whole country. "
CAGE-FREE COMPANIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/cage-free-companies,"AUGUST 18, 2009"," Thankfully, more and more people are thinking about the food on their plate and where it originates. This is evidenced by Gap, Inc.’s recent move to use cage-free eggs in its corporate cafeterias. The company made the decision after learning about the tiny battery cages on factory farms where egg-laying hens are kept. And while McDonald’s is using only free-range eggs in other countries, it has also decided to move toward cage-free eggs at its Australian chains. Woolworths, an Australian  supermarket company, also recently confirmed that it will cut its cage eggs in half by 2010. Perhaps these changes will lead consumers to continue questioning the origins of different foods and rejecting factory farm methods. "
MERCY FOR ANIMALS EXPANDS,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/mercy-for-animals-expands,"AUGUST 18, 2009","Mercy For Animals (MFA) has made some incredible moves throughout the years, from nixing egg products in Boca burgers to reaching myriads of people with a veg message. Its next move is another hugely beneficial one: MFA is expanding to New York City. The New York Advocacy Center will be located in central Manhattan and will act as a home for volunteer and intern work, provide access to MFA literature and the latest news, and hold vegan cooking classes and workshops. MFA’s New York Campaign Director Lydia Chaudhry will be leading the way and reaching out to the enormous NYC population. Chaudhry comes from a thorough background in ethical veganism, even having graduated from The Natural Gourmet Institute. This is one big expansion headed in the right direction! "
GREENPEACE HELPS SWEDEN,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/greenpeace-helps-sweden,"AUGUST 17, 2009","The sea may not be as vibrant and jovial as Disney’s The Little Mermaid would have one believe, and Greenpeace is doing something about it. In an effort to halt bottom trawling, a practice in which metal chains are dragged across the ocean floor to collect deep-sea fish, Greenpeace dropped 180 enormous boulders into the German North Sea Monday, August 10. Each boulder, weighing between .5 to 3 tons, acts as a blockage to the practice that demolishes an area twice the size of the 48 bottom states combined each year. Additionally, up to 80 percent of what’s caught is unwanted, in poor condition, or dead; sadly, these catches are thrown back into the water. The giant boulders may help little fish swim a bit more freely. "
PORK SALES DROP,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/pork-sales-drop,"AUGUST 17, 2009","With swine flu, E. coli, and poor health abound, it may come as no surprise that the US’ fastest-growing export is suffering. As the end of the year approaches, it is predicted that pork sales are to drop 33 percent from 44.65 cents a pound. If this happens, it will be the first annual decline in pork exports since 1990. Being blamed for an 11 percent drop is swine flu, and the general loss has farmers concerned with hog surplus. Livestock economist at the University of Missouri Glenn Grimes posits that pigs may cost 30 to 32 cents a pound in November because of undesired supply. Though this decline is bad news for the pork pushers, it’s definitely good news when it comes to reducing the amount of death and suffering that farmed pigs endure. "
DOSA TO PROMOTE VEG DIET,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/dosa-to-promote-veg-diet,"AUGUST 17, 2009"," A dosa over 30 feet long to promote a veg diet? Sounds like the work of some media-savvy animal rights group, right? But this crepe-like dish made from lentils and rice will be constructed at Sankalp restaurant in Ahmedabad, India, to promote Quick Gun Murugun, an Indian film about a cowboy who fights for the virtues of vegetarian food. The dosa will be prepared by the film’s star, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, and Vivek Kishnani of Fox Star Studios says that a never-before-made size of the Indian delicacy would be a sure way to grab attention and promote vegetarianism. Seeing as the main character’s goal is to make the world vegetarian, we’re anxiously awaiting the film’s stateside arrival. "
TRANSIT AUTHORITY REFUSES TO RUN FACTORY FARM ADS,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/transit-authority-refuses-to-run-factory-farm-ads,"AUGUST 16, 2009","While the confining gestation crates that factory farm pigs are forced to live in are common practice in the agriculture industry, the Raleigh Transit Authority has decided not to run advertisements by the Humane Society of the United States that feature pictures of the pigs in the cages. As a result, the HSUS is pressing charges against the RTA on the grounds that their first amendment rights are being violated. “The Raleigh Transit Authority cannot refuse to run this advertisement just because it is uncomfortable with showing the public how abused most breeding pigs in the pork industry are,” said Jonathan Lovvorn, who works for the animal protection litigation at the HSUS. Currently, North Carolina is one of the largest pork producers in the country. "
SALES OF BOTTLED WATER DOWN,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/sales-of-bottled-water-down,"AUGUST 16, 2009","For the past decade, bottled water has seemed to be the best thing since sliced bread. That is, until we realized those weekly 20-packs of plastic bottles are wasting resources and clogging up landfills. The voice of reason and environmentalism has kicked in and for the first time in at least five years, bottled water sales have fallen. Perhaps most notably feeling the draught is Nestlé, the US’ largest seller of bottled water. It reported Wednesday that sales in the first half of the year dropped 2.7 percent with water sales losing the most, the first drop in the past six years. With experts pointing to economic hardship as the reason for the fall in sales, some also note cities such as Takoma Park, Wash., banning bottled water from government events and offices. With tap water’s nearly free fee and reusable water bottles abound, environmentalists’ cups (or bottles) are certainly half full. "
"IF BABIES MEAN HIGHER CARBON FOOTPRINTS, SHOULD WE STOP REPRODUCING?",https://vegnews.com/2009/8/if-babies-mean-higher-carbon-footprints-should-we-stop-reproducing,"AUGUST 15, 2009","We try our best to do what we can to keep our carbon footprints low. We buy produce locally, eliminate meat from our diets, drink from reusable stainless-steel water bottles, and use efficient modes of transportation. The biggest impact one can make, however, may be to avoid having children. According to a newly released Oregon State University study, having a child impacts the environment significantly more than any other energy-saving behavior. Using the example of an American woman who takes action to reduce her footprint by investing in an energy-efficient car and recycling (among other things), the report states that if that woman has two children, her carbon footprint will rise to 20 times what she had saved from her do-gooder actions. Geographical location also plays a role, as an American woman who has a child will create more than five times the carbon footprint of a Chinese woman with a child. In 2008, the United Nations Population Fund released global fertility rates per woman. Afghanistan came in with the highest average at 7.3 children, and Germany came in at the lowest with 1.3. The US stood at 2.0 children per woman, while China came in at a 1.7 average. With US rates of birth already higher than China’s, the effects of American women having children may create an unmeasurably large carbon impact. VegNews asked women across America to weigh in on the hot issue of baby making with this question: “Considering all the environmental, ethical, and social reasons for being veg, do you have or plan on having children?” “I chose to have one child and to teach him all the wonderful aspects of being an activist and working toward positive change. I set an example for him everyday by being compassionate about the earth and all of its living creatures, and hope that he, too, will choose this path in life.”
Julie Martinez, Placentia, Calif. “Having children is inconsistent with an environmental/ vegan/animal-rights agenda. Overpopulation is at the core of all the problems we address. And who is to say your child will not decide to become carnivorous at some point in their life? We ultimately have no control of that.”
Teresa D’Amico, New York City, NY “My mother once said that if all the ethical people chose not to have children while the unethical people did, it would wipe out a whole generation of people who could make a difference in the world. I think this argument still holds up.”
Sydney Richey, Hillsboro, Ore. “There are too many humans on this planet for it to support our consumption rates. Habitat loss, species destruction, dependence on monoculture, and GMO crops all take place in the name of feeding the masses. I can’t ethically justify having children.”
Melissa Swanson, St. Paul, Minn. The baby debate is obviously highly individualized with both sides having solid arguments, but the facts are undeniable. Where do you stand? "
MEET THE ANIMALS OF ANIMAL PLACE SANCTUARY,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/meet-the-animals-of-animal-place-sanctuary,"AUGUST 15, 2009","Say hello to the recent rescues from Animal Place. These individuals share 60 acres (soon to be 600 acres after the move to Grass Valley) of forest, meadow, and hills in Vacaville, Calif., and each has his or her own interesting rescue story. This is our fifth featurette on recent rescues, and every week these featured animals prove that every life saved counts when it comes to living meat-free. Freedom and Summer the Calves
Their story: These adorable Jersey male calves (pictured above) were rescued at an auction—no farmers would purchase these babies since Freedom has no tail and Summer was extremely malnourished. This is how they arrived at Animal Place and have since regained their strength to seek out and untie shoelaces and play with hair. Freedom is the brave one of the pair—he is always eager to greet visitors, while Summer often hides behind a staff member until he gathers the courage to be social.
Favorite food: Both Freedom and Summer love grain, though Freedom does like to sample any surface available to him, including wood and metal.
Best thing ever: Both are extremely playful and love to kick their heels high and frolic in the field. Boris the Rabbit
Boris’ story: Boris was one of three individuals rescued from an overpopulated field of rabbits, and just in the nick of time—a school nearby wanted to poison them. This just happened to be the same school that started this population after a teacher let two rabbits into the field. Animal rescuers worked tirelessly for the chance to trap and spay or neuter the bunnies and place them into permanent homes. Though Boris is safe and sound now, he is still very shy around people and other rabbits.
Favorite food: Carrots and parsley.
Best thing ever: Head scratches, but Boris only accepts them on his terms! Looloo the Hen
Looloo’s story: This fluffy little baby had the misfortune of being abandoned in a neighborhood full of feral cats. Poor Looloo was attacked but was saved by the feral cats’ caregivers, who rushed to her aid and nursed her back to health. They eventually contacted Animal Place, and the shelter welcomed her with open arms. Now healthy and happy, Looloo is still shy around other birds and darts in and out of the feeding area. The roosters have accepted and are very kind to her, and she is slowly growing more comfortable with her surroundings.
Favorite food: Grapes and some more grapes.
Best thing ever: People! Looloo loves to run up to visitors and sit on their laps—she also is very interested in watches and shoelaces. Susie the Pig
Susie’s story: Kind and gentle Susie was used as a “production pig” for research with lung ventilation experiments. Pigs are often used in research because of the many physical similarities they share with humans. How did Susie get out of her horrible situation? The researcher actually had a change of heart and fell in love with her “subject” and felt obligated to save Susie’s life. Susie now roams Animal Place in search of back scratches and belly rubs.
Favorite food: Sweet cantaloupe.
Best thing ever: The legs of staff members—when utilized correctly, make great scratching posts. Need more cute? Check out the recent rescues at Pigs Peace, Animal Acres, Farm Sanctuary, and Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary. "
CHEFS SAY “NO” TO SEAFOOD,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/chefs-say-no-to-seafood,"AUGUST 14, 2009","With advances made by the European Union to ban the sale of all seal products, the movement to end seal hunting is moving in the right direction. Having decreased the slaughter of seals in Canada from 273,000 to 70,000 in 2009, chefs are contributing to the efforts to make turn that slaughter number to zero. Seventy top chefs and restaurateurs are banning together to boycott Canadian seafood until seal slaughter comes to a complete end. Seeing that the United States contributes $2.4 billion each year to Canada for seafood, the boycott will make an enormous statement, and perhaps an enormous impact. "
FISH LINKED TO DIABETES,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/fish-linked-to-diabetes,"AUGUST 14, 2009","A new Harvard study should prompt people to hold up before delving into that dish of fish—it’s been linked to type 2 diabetes. The study, featured in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that risk increase was modest for the occasional fish eater, but in women who consumed five or more fish servings per week, the risk increases to 22 percent. With standard American serving sizes, it might be pretty easy to increase one’s risk. The good news, though, is that studies have shown that type 2 diabetes can improve with the help of a low-fat vegan diet. Time to ditch the fish and make the switch. "
SPECIES THREATENED,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/species-threatened,"AUGUST 14, 2009","A taste for exotic meat has driven many species to the brink of extinction in Vietnam. Demand for wild meat used to be limited to mountain communities, but it has spread to rich urban areas. It is estimated that 3,400 tons of wild meat is being consumed each year, with about 18 percent of it being consumed illegally. Experts spoke out about the problem at a conference dealing with the protection of wildlife, and concluded that threatened species include the rhinoceros, the white-handed gibbon, the civet, and the tapir. Perhaps pubic awareness will curb this nasty habit—and there are plenty of meat- and dairy-substitutes created each year to satisfy one’s appetite for something new. "
UK GREEN AWARDS 2009,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/uk-green-awards-2009,"AUGUST 13, 2009","Not only is the UK acknowledging the green elite in its Green Awards 2009, but it’s also hosting the event in a fashion that aligns with major movements around the world. Created in 2006 to honor work that promotes the importance of sustainable developments, social responsibility, and ethical practices in marketing, the Green Awards 2009 will take place Wednesday, November 18. In support of Meat-free Mondays and londonontap.org, the reception’s menu will be completely meat-free and bottled water will be verboten. With such eco-minded party fare, this may be an awards show worthy of its own praise. "
BIXI GOES TO BOSTON,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/bixi-goes-to-boston,"AUGUST 13, 2009","It’s commonly known that grabbing a bike instead of hailing a taxi helps reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Now multiply the change one bicycler can create by the population of a city. Montreal’s biking-sharing program, Bixi, has done just that and now plans to expand to Boston and London. A healthy and eco-friendly alternative to other modes of public transport, Bixi works similarly. In Montreal, a user heads to one of the 278 stations, pays a fee, rides the bike wherever he or she desires, then places it back in any one of the Bixi stations. Already claiming to have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions by more than 909,000 kg, Bixi’s expansion in Boston is projected to have 290 stations and offer 2,500 bikes for usage. That’s definitely smart transportation. "
CUT CHRONIC DISEASE,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/cut-chronic-disease,"AUGUST 13, 2009","Though there is no real fountain of youth that will keep you sprightly in perpetuity, there are certain things you can control in order to live a healthier, longer life. According to new research in the UK, people who live a healthy lifestyle reduce their risk of developing chronic diseases by almost 80 percent. The study defined healthy living as those who exercise for at least three and a half hours per week and eat a diet that’s high in fruits, vegetables, grains, and low in red meat. Of those studied who adhered to this definition, 93 percent were less likely to develop diabetes, 81 percent less likely to have a heart attack, and 50 percent less likely to have a stroke. It’s time to load up your plates with greens and grains and get movin’! "
LUSH COLLABORATION,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/lush-collaboration,"AUGUST 12, 2009","Before you suds up or layer on some lotion, you may want to check to see whether your body potion contains palm oil, an ingredient that Lush Cosmetics has decided to eliminate from all its products. In an effort to save orangutans whose lives are threatened by the destruction of rainforests for palm oil plantations, Lush has joined forces with the World Society for the Protection of Animals to bring Charity Pot, a vegan lotion, to the market. With each purchase of this cocoa-buttery lotion, every single penny of the retail price is donated to help provide food and shelter for orangutans that have been rescued in Borneo. Borneo and Sumatra, the homes of orangutans, have seen 90 percent of all rainforests destroyed, thus leading to the possible extinction of orangutans within 10 years. Charity Pot is one little purchase that might make a big difference. "
LEATHER DESTROYS THE RAINFOREST,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/leather-destroys-the-rainforest,"AUGUST 12, 2009","A Greenpeace study has prompted several top footwear giants to demand an immediate moratorium on the destruction of the Amazon rainforest by leather suppliers in Brazil. Clarks, Adidas, Nike, and Timberland are some of the brands that are concerned about leather sourcing and the clearing of tropical forests for agriculture that supplies the fashion industry. To dramatically reduce environmental impact, a cease to sourcing leather from areas of deforestation is necessary. But wouldn’t the best way to go about it be to research and adopt leather alternatives? Perhaps the best way to go about it would be to research and adopt leather-free alternatives, but at least this is a start for the shoe mega-giants. "
FOIE GRAS LAWSUIT,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/foie-gras-lawsuit,"AUGUST 12, 2009","Foie gras turns out to be dirty in more ways than one. Not only is this process by which birds are force fed by tubes being rammed down their throats dirty, but so is the incredible amount of waste from this cruel practice that allegedly fouls up New York’s Middle Mongaup River. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) is taking a stand against it. HSUS is charging Hudson Valley Foie Gras, the nation’s largest foie gras factory farm, with over 1,100 violations of the federal Clean Water Act, and a federal court in Manhattan has cleared the way for this lawsuit. Congrats to HSUS for digging up some dirt and taking this foie gras giant to task. "
GOING GREEN FROM OREGON TO IRAQ,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/going-green-from-oregon-to-iraq,"AUGUST 11, 2009","The entire globe needs to take action to combat climate change, and Iraq is now facing the fact. Playing nice with Oregon universities and United States Department of State, 19 professors and deans from Iraq are currently in Oregon, learning the ins and outs of green building. While it may seem as though Iraq has more important concerns, officials realize that taking care of the resources they have is essential, according to the Kurdish Ministry of Higher Education’s director of engineering projects. The group is learning by visiting the location of Portland’s planned solar highway, gathering for lectures, and participating in discussions about solar power and urban heat islands at Portland State University. This Oregon-Iraq collaboration may lead to Iraq’s first big push for green power and sustainability, which is sure to be a happy development. "
BEETROOT INCREASES STAMINA,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/beetroot-increases-stamina,"AUGUST 11, 2009","Just another reason why veggies are so darn awesome: nitrate contained in beetroot juices leads to a reduction in oxygen uptake, which makes exercise less tiring. A University of Exeter team, based in the UK, found this key ingredient in beetroot, and the Journal of Applied Physiology suggests that a greater physical effect results from consuming beetroot than from regular training. The study focused on eight men who knocked back about 16 oz of beetroot juice for six consecutive days before being subjected to a series of tests. The subjects were able to bike further after having the beetroot juice versus the placebo. Take note, endurance athletes—if you want to stay on your feet, you better consume the beet! "
HORSES SLAUGHTERED IN FLORIDA,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/horses-slaughtered-in-florida,"AUGUST 11, 2009","Geronimo, a quarter horse who lived on the property of Ivonne Rodriguez for five years, was found slaughtered under a tree. Whoever killed this gentle horse covered his carcass with a tarp and palm fronds. This isn’t an uncommon occurrence in South Florida, where Geronimo lived—horses are being killed for their meat and it is suspected that many of these atrocities are not being reported. According to Scott Andress of the Miami-Dade Police Department, horses that are slaughtered are often dismembered and the meat is removed from their bodies. Richard Couto of the South Florida Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals calls it South Florida’s dirty little secret, and says that on the black market a pound of horse meat can go for $7 to $20. It’s high time for this dirty little secret to reach the public so that this sick slaughter can end. "
NC TO REDUCE WIND PROJECTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/nc-to-reduce-wind-projects,"AUGUST 10, 2009","Though wind energy can be highly beneficial to the environment, North Carolina is taking a stand against it. In the strongest vote against wind turbines in any state, the North Carolina State Senate voted 42 to one Thursday, August 6. Specifically, lawmakers voted to ban large wind turbines in the state’s most scenic Western ridgelines. The proposed bill would amend a 1983 law to allow turbines that are only 100 feet or smaller to be built on ridgelines of 3,000 feet or higher. The bill has been sent to the House of Representatives, which may take several months to be examined, and a passed bill would essentially ban two-thirds of onshore wind sources in North Carolina, according to wind program coordinator of the Southern Alliance of Clean Energy Brandon R. Blevins. "
MILLS’ NEW MARKET,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/mills-new-market,"AUGUST 10, 2009","It’s a bit of a challenge to keep track of all the things Heather Mills is up to these days, but try you must. She’s successfully launched her vegan café, VBites, is developing a new frozen food line, and has acquired The Redwood Whole Food Company, a faux-meat giant in the UK. Expanding her sights beyond food, Mills is launching a clothing line, Be@1, August 27 at Celebrity Catwalk, which raises funds and awareness for National Animal Rescue. Taking place in Hollywood Highlands, the debut of Mills’ line will feature recycled charity shop clothing that has been stylized in fresh ways. We’ll be eager to see how Mills puts her spin on eco-couture. "
BRITAIN’S VEG RESCUE PLAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/britains-veg-rescue-plan,"AUGUST 10, 2009","A whole country of vegetarians—could it ever happen? It very well might, but not because of ethical or health concerns. In the event of a world food shortage, the British population would likely adopt a vegetarian diet, according to a new official assessment on the UK’s food security. The country is currently at risk because more crops are being grown for bio-fuel instead of food, the worldwide population is increasing, and climate change is causing extreme weather patterns. A worst-case scenario would have Britain shifting the cereals used to feed farmed animals into production for human consumption. Perhaps this latest example of how unsustainable a meat-based diet is will help Britons and citizens around the globe to realize how much more efficient a vegan diet can be. "
IN-VITRO MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/in-vitro-meat,"AUGUST 9, 2009","Within ten years, in-vitro meat could be a commercial possibility, and it would be healthier for people and the planet. Jason Matheny of research group New Harvest says that it would decrease the risk of diseases such as swine flu and mad cow disease, and that scientists could grow meat in sterile conditions in contrast to crowded factory farms. The meat’s fat content could be controlled as well, and the growing process would be an Earth-friendly alternative to factory farming, which contributes heavily to climate change. But one concern is that the public won’t be interested in in-vitro meat, believing that it isn’t “natural.” In response to these concerns, Matheny says that “raising 10,000 chickens indoors and pumping them full of drugs isn’t natural, either.” Not to mention that cramping chickens into tiny spaces for their short lives is completely unethical as well. "
VEGAN KICKSTART,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/vegan-kickstart,"AUGUST 9, 2009","It may seem daunting to some at first, but the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) wants to make trying your hand at veganism as easy as possible. To help those who have ever wanted to give veganism a go, yet haven’t had the resources or the know-how, PCRM is launching a new program: the 21-Day Vegan Kickstart. Claiming to lend you a hand in whatever your food fight may be—whether it’s cheesecake, burgers, or fro-yo—this program is set up to show you that a vegan diet is not only healthful, but easy. During the 21 days, participants will be sent supportive emails and simple recipes, will view nutrition webcasts that feature Dr. Neal Barnard, and will have the support system of other participants. The program starts September 8, so sign yourself (or that friend you’re always trying to convince to go veg) up now. "
CASH FOR CLUCKERS,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/cash-for-cluckers,"AUGUST 9, 2009","Parodying the “cash for clunkers” program offered by the federal government in which car buyers who switch to more fuel-efficient vehicles are given a financial incentive, PETA is offering a one-dollar rebate for faux chicken products with its “Cash for Cluckers” program. The rebate is only being offered to omnivores and will come with a copy of PETA’s Vegetarian Starter Kit. The group says that the rebate is aimed at helping the environment, as a United Nations report found that the meat industry produces more greenhouse gasses than all the SUVs, cars, trucks, planes, and ships in the world combined. "
VEGAN SUN-CARE SAVVY,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/vegan-sun-care-savvy,"AUGUST 8, 2009","Ah, the sun. Giver of light and life, yet dually the purveyor of entropy and damage when it comes to skin. Yes, our relationship with the sun—it’s complicated. And sure, it’s nice to soak up some warmth and rays, but moderation and protection is key, unless you want those unflattering clusters of pigment known as sunspots popping up or, worse-case scenario, the big C—cancer! And we can’t forget the best reason of all to wear sunblock: You just don’t want to look like a lobster (no offense to those awesome crustaceans, it’s just not a good look for us). Depending on your planned summer activities, you’ll need the right product for the job. Let’s survey the goods, shall we? Since it’s summer, you want to splash around in the pool, then sun it up like a lazy desert lizard on a rock, skin-healthy hype be damned! We certainly can’t talk you out of basking in those rays, but we can suggest that you browse Jason’s Sunbrellas collection for some serious skin defense, and we’re talking their water-resistant, SPF 40 sunblock. That should shield you from the third degree. And if you’re not standing under Jason’s Sunbrella, you better butter your exposed epidermis with Age Reversal Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 from Dessert Essence Organics. After applying, shake your lotion-covered fist at the sky and shout, “take that, UVA and UVB rays!” Now, let’s go with a planned hike or jog scenario. That shining mass of incandescent gas will certainly threaten to blister your sensitive nose or shoulders during these activities, and a little sweat might find its way into your eyes. Athletic outdoor enthusiasts should try Jason’s Active Block SPF 40—this sunblock offers full-spectrum skin protection. And if you expect to work up a heavy sweat, go with Sport Block SPF 30 Dry Finish from Nature’s Gate. Those harmful UVA rays will be shining on someone else’s parade. Or perhaps you’re wrapped up in an air-conditioned cocoon from nine to five but still want the look of having enjoyed long summer days outdoors. There’s a sunless tanner for that. Get the glow pronto with Instant Sunless Tanner from Kiss My Face. Rub some mock melanin into your gams for a modest glow in minutes and a dark faux glow in four hours. Also, this sunless wonder allows you to see where it’s being applied so there will be no nasty streaks to foil your cover. You are good to go. One more thing: Just because you’re stuck in that stuffy office all day doesn’t mean you should deny the sun defense—factor in the work commute and office windows, people. You’re better safe than sorry. Try Alba’s Fragrance-Free Sunscreen SPF 15 for everyday, grease- and fragrance-free sun care. It’s fast absorbing, which is great considering how crazy the rush to work can be most days. Yes, the sun may be very warm and inviting, but be suspicious of its true nature and always wear sunblock!

VEGGIE CONQUEST VEGAN COOKING COMPETITION,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/veggie-conquest-vegan-cooking-competition,"AUGUST 8, 2009","From county fairs to television cook-offs, would-be chefs across the country display an unflinching desire to be judged. While most competitors ultimately fade back into the safety and obscurity of their home kitchens, a crucial demographic is conspicuously lacking from the start: where are all the veg chefs? While vegan eating recently played a supporting role on Top Chef Masters, as embodied by the lovely Zooey Deschanel, the animal-free crowd is ready for a challenge all our own. Look no further than Veggie Conquest, the explosive, strictly-vegan cooking competition straight from the brain of tofu-fueled foodie Jessica Mahady. The NYC-based contest kicks off August 22, providing a fun and exciting platform for amateur chefs to showcase their creativity and culinary skills. With secret ingredient challenges, all-star judges, and the promise of a delicious meal, chefs and spectators alike can expect a stellar show. VegNews caught up with Mahady for the inside scoop on the nation’s next cooking craze. VegNews: Tell us about Veggie Conquest.
Jessica Mahady: Veggie Conquest is an amateur cooking competition in New York City, and you can sign up as a chef or a taster. Chefs create an original recipe based on a secret ingredient that’s revealed a week before the event. They prepare their dish at home and bring it to the event to be judged and devoured. VN: What inspired you to start the event?
JM: Veggie Conquest started as an idea I had for a potluck. I talked with friends about it, and the idea grew. Before I knew it, I was planning a full-on cooking competition with a website, fabulous judges, and several tickets sold. We vegans like competitive cooking, too. Also, I think we’ve got to keep showing that vegan food can be much more than twigs and berries. VN: Who can be involved?
JM: Anyone! Though we do ask that chefs at the competitions should be amateurs. If you’re a food industry pro, you can be a judge or taster, or compete later in our professional challenge. We have so many foodies in NYC. I think all foodies love a good healthy competition. Non-vegans should see it as an extra challenge, a way to push their skills and expand their palates. We want to show non-vegans that vegan food can be easy to make and taste fabulous, too. VN: You have some pretty impressive judges for the first challenge: Joshua Katcher, Brian Preston-Campbell, and Kathy Patalsky. How did you get them involved?
JM: Yes, they’re fantastic! I just sent each a nice e-mail explaining what we are doing and how we would love for them to be involved. They didn’t need a lot of convincing. They share the love for good food and competition. VN: What are the criteria for a winning dish?
JM: A chef wins by having the highest combined score from the tasters and the judges. The winning dish must be original, be vegan, feature the secret ingredient, and be finger-lickin’ good. Winning chefs will get fantastic prizes donated by local restaurants, grocers, or kitchen supply stores. VN: How frequently do you hope to have the competitions?
JM: We are striving for every month. It might not be the normal amateur competition every month, though. For example, our upcoming professional challenge might feature a restaurant chef competing against a cookbook author! "
SAVEUR EDITOR TOUTS VEG CUISINE,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/saveur-editor-touts-veg-cuisine,"AUGUST 7, 2009","Vegan cooking went primetime Wednesday, August 6, at 10pm when Top Chef Masters took on the ultimate vegan cooking challenge. Actress Zooey Deschanel asked chefs to prepare a vegan, soy-free, gluten-free lunch, which made some chefs and judges flinch while others took to the challenge like fish to water. One judge who highly praises vegetarian cooking is James Oseland, the editor-in-chief of Saveur magazine. Oseland wrote his reflections on the challenge in a blog post, sharing that many people in the food world bash vegetarian cooking. Standing up for the meat- and dairy-free fare, Oseland posits that vegetarian cooking turns one into a more thoughtful cook, as he or she cannot fall back on the rich and robust flavors that come with butter and bacon. He says that when done right, “vegetarian cooking can be extraordinarily sophisticated and refined.” The editor and author also notes that this was the only meal of all the competitions that didn’t leave him feeling like “an overstuffed cushion.” Though Oseland does eat meat, he remembers his vegetarian periods as well rested, healthier, lighter, and clearer minded. To all vegetarian cooks, whip up an exquisite meal and bon appétit. "

ALZHEIMER’S RISK,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/alzheimers-risk,"AUGUST 6, 2009","To keep your brain in good shape, you might want to forgo the meat and dairy. A new study has discovered that elevated amounts of cholesterol, a waxy substance in fats in the bloodstream found only in animal products, may raise the risk of getting Alzheimer’s. The study followed more than 9,000 people in Northern California for four decades and found that adults who have even moderately elevated cholesterol in their early 40s are at risk for Alzheimer’s disease as well as related dementias. High-range cholesterol in the study was associated with a 66 percent increase in Alzheimer’s risk, and borderline high cholesterol pushed the risk for vascular dementia to 52 percent. For a healthy mind, stick to a healthier, plant-based diet. "
HUNTER SERVES VEGAN DINNER,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/hunter-serves-vegan-dinner,"AUGUST 6, 2009","What happens when two opposite worlds, such as meat-eating hunters and vegans who advocate animal rights, meet for dinner? Perhaps surprisingly, stimulating conversation about meat consumption in America and the shared enjoyment of delicious vegan food. The Humane Society of the Unites States’ Chief Economist and Senior State Director Jennifer Fearing challenged anti-factory farming hunter, food writer, and blogger Hank Shaw to cook a “haute cuisine” vegan meal, to which he accepted and invited Fearing to join. Fearing, who was the campaign manager for the successful Proposition 2 in November 2008, and Shaw agreed on many things discussed over dinner: both detest factory farming, and both believe that Americans need to cut back on meat consumption for health and moral reasons. Conversation came easy as they devoured the exquisite seven-course meal Shaw prepared. Feasting on tomato salami antipasti, Andalucian gazpacho, and porcini with homemade barley tagliatelle, among other courses, there is no doubt this vegan dinner was fulfilling on many levels for both parties. "
LIVE NATION GOES VEG,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/live-nation-goes-veg,"AUGUST 6, 2009","Legendary rocker and vegan restaurateur Chrissie Hynde is making more noise with her veg ways than ever before. Known for banning meat at her concerts, Hynde has been a long-time animal rights activist as well as the lead singer of The Pretenders. In order to avoid running into problems, concert promoter Live Nation has decided to completely ban meat sales from any upcoming concerts in which Hynde is performing. In lieu of cheeseburgers and corndogs, concert-goers can expect veggie burgers and dogs, and New Yorkers can even attend a pre-concert veggie barbecue. Live Nation certainly knows how to rock out the right way. "
MEAT INTO ELECTRICITY,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/meat-into-electricity,"AUGUST 5, 2009","Imagine finding out that your house is powered by meat, of all things. This could certainly be the case in the UK as Tesco, a UK-based grocery and merchandising giant, ships off 5,000 tons of meat that has passed its sell-by date to be recycled into electricity. Vegetarians International Voice for Animals (Viva!) is outraged about this fact, and believes that consumers should be informed if meat is being used to power their houses. Tesco claims that using the meat for electricity is part of a green drive, but Viva! simply sees it as proof of greed and indifference. Viva! campaigns manager Justin Kerswell says that “you have to ask yourself: why is so much [meat] left over and why are so many animals dying to provide this excess?” Wouldn’t we all like to know? "
TEEN WINS VEG SCHOLARSHIP,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/teen-wins-veg-scholarship,"AUGUST 5, 2009","Spreading the good word about vegetarianism? Now that’s something definitely worthy of a scholarship. Ryne Poelker, who graduated from Porta High School in Petersburg, Ill., received a $5,000 college scholarship from the Vegetarian Resource Group for taking a veg stand. While writing a short paper for a class assignment, Poelker discovered the truth behind how his food was made. Immediately, he ditched the meat and started to promote a plant-based diet, and is now fully vegan. Poelker has organized vegetarian potlucks and food drives as well as many protests against animal cruelty. He plans to promote meatless meals at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he will study political science. Keep up the good work, Poelker! "
"KATHY FRESTON, FASHIONISTA",https://vegnews.com/2009/8/kathy-freston-fashionista,"AUGUST 5, 2009","The same woman who wowed Oprah into giving veganism a go is now wowing the fashion elite. Kathy Freston, author of Quantum Wellness: A Practical and Spiritual Guide to Health and Happiness, has just been added to Vanity Fair’s 2009 International Best-Dressed List. The gorgeous, lithe blonde joins the ranks of fashion heavy-hitters such as Anne Hathaway, Brad Pitt, Barack and Michelle Obama, Renée Zellweger, and First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. In the Vanity Fair feature, Freston notes Stella McCartney, another chic vegan, as her favorite shoe designer, and describes her personal style as “cruelty-free.“ Freston proves that there is nothing more stunning than the combination of smarts and style.

NUTRITION ACT AD CAMPAIGN,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/nutrition-act-ad-campaign,"AUGUST 4, 2009","An 8-year-old vegetarian is about to shake things up for the sake of healthy school lunches. In a new ad campaign that aims to reform the Child Nutrition Act to include more fruits, vegetables, and vegetarian meals in school lunches, young Jasmine Messiah is pictured next to the tagline: “President Obama’s daughters get healthy school lunches. Why don’t I?” Some think the ad—which is sponsored by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine—shouldn’t mention Sasha and Malia, as the news media should respect their privacy. The ads were specifically designed to get the attention of the White House, and perhaps more nutritious veg meals for children will be a result. "
HABITAT SPREADS THE GREEN,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/habitat-spreads-the-green,"AUGUST 4, 2009","As if building homes for those in need isn’t generous enough, Habitat for Humanity International is also focusing on treating the environment just as charitably. Teaming up with The Home Depot Foundation, Habitat will be building 5,000 homes over the next five years that meet Energy Star guidelines or other nationally recognized green building standards. The $30 million program, known as Partners in Sustainable Building, includes 120 Habitat affiliates in 45 states. With grants of either $3,000 or $5,000, depending on how well a prospective house meets green standards, affiliates will build homes that use up to 50 percent less energy than conventional homes, utilize high-efficiency plumbing that cuts one-third of water consumption, and emit 11 tons less carbon and green house gas emissions per household annually. That certainly sounds like home, sweet home. "
FACTORY FARM FEUD,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/factory-farm-feud,"AUGUST 4, 2009","Wouldn’t you want a say if a factory farm was slated for construction near your home, bringing on the possibility of pollution and the merciless slaughter of animals? In Iowa, new rules could limit public input over the permit approval process for confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs). The process currently includes public concerns to be voiced before the Environmental Protection Commission (EPA) about new CAFOs that are proposed. But now the EPA is considering doing away with this democratic part of the process and only acknowledging input from representatives applying for a permit, the county board of supervisors, and the Department of Natural Resources. Iowans have until Thursday, August 6, to make a comment on the new rule. Speak up while you can! "

That’s because renowned chef, restaurateur, and author Alice Waters signed Humane Society International’s No Shark Fin Pledge, agreeing never to serve or consume products containing shark fin. A number of chefs have already created and implemented faux-shark dishes out of concern for the declining shark population. Water says she understands how serious the threat is to sharks and, in regards to signing the petition, she “encourage[s] other chefs and culinary industry leaders to do the same.” "
PLUM BISTRO OPENS,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/plum-bistro-opens,"AUGUST 3, 2009","Vegan restaurants with solid menus can be few and far between.

Check out Try Vegan’s website for the details on Try Vegan Week 2009, and get ready for a veg-tastic time. One try never hurt anyone. "
MEET MORE OF THE ANIMALS OF PIGS PEACE SANCTUARY,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/meet-more-of-the-animals-of-pigs-peace-sanctuary,"AUGUST 3, 2009","This week’s rescues hail from Pigs Peace Sanctuary in Stanwood, Wash., where they sunbathe (weather permitting) and enjoy peanut butter sandwiches. Here are four more reasons to always forgo the bacon and stick to yummy tempeh. And, as always, prepare yourself for the cuteness coma that will ensue after reading these stories.

Chester
Chester’s story: This not-so-little piggie (as you can see above: that’s him on the left with a baby Emma Sue) came to Pigs Peace from a life of confinement in a factory farm—he was to be slaughtered at five months of age. Though Chester is unable to walk due to a compressed spinal cord, this guy lives a full life at the sanctuary and is always super alert during mealtime. He puts his empty dish directly in front of his body as a reminder that it needs refilling!
Favorite Food: Bananas, pears, and watermelon all together for a sweetness overload.
Best buddies: Fern and Missy—they all cuddle up on cold nights on a big, bad bed of soft hay.
Favorite thing: New baby piglets. Chester’s a sucker for ’em, and he loves when they climb on him and snuggle next to him.

Curley
Curley’s story: This showbiz pig was lucky to have made it to Pig’s Peace to avoid the horrible fate of being slaughtered, as most piglets used for commercials are. Curley’s glad to be away from the cameras and at the spacious sanctuary, where he spends his days exploring the grounds and hanging out with visitors.
Favorite food: Heaps of peanuts still in the shell. Curley’s mouth turns into the peanut vacuum when he spots a pile of these tasty treats.
Best buddy: Big pig friend Albert. These guys like to roam together into the woods and graze in the meadow. They even sleep side-by-side every night.

Emma Sue
Emma Sue’s story: This little baby was born a runt with an umbilical hernia—she was dangerously close to death when she arrived at Pigs Peace Sanctuary. With a little TLC, Emma Sue was able to recover and thrive and is 100-percent grateful for her so-called “defective” body.
Best buddy: Pricilla the potbellied pig. These two fast friends have slept side-by-side every night since they first met.
Favorite food: Blackberries. Emma Sue loves to hunt for these prized berries when she roams in the woods at Pigs Peace.

Kado
Kado’s story: This curious and sweet pig was dumped at the side of a barren country road and left to fend for himself. Perhaps he had grown too big or wasn’t “cute enough”—either way, this domestic pig just wasn’t wanted anymore by his previous guardians, but Pigs Peace certainly welcomed him with open arms. Kado has to be the happiest pig at the sanctuary: Judy Woods reports that he is always full of joy and enthusiasm for life.
Favorite thing: Tummy rubs. Kado’s always on the prowl for a tummy rub—he runs up to greet visitors, then instantly flops down, rolls over for one, and smiles when hands rub his belly. And if he sees another pig being petted, watch out! He’s there right quick to get his fair share of the action.
Best Buddy: Kado is always seen palling around with Wilbur.

WHY I WENT VEG WITH MARYLAND’S JAMIE RASKIN,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/why-i-went-veg-with-marylands-jamie-raskin,"AUGUST 3, 2009","On a cold December afternoon in 2008, Maryland State Senator Jamie Raskin lay down for a nap. Raskin was plucked from his slumber by a call from a reporter who asked: “What can everyone in our community do to be green in 2009?” The senator didn’t think twice before saying, “Everyone should go vegetarian for one week.” Though still a meat-eater at the time, Raskin had considered the potential benefits of adopting a veg diet, but lacked a starting point for changing his habits. Thanks to Takoma Park’s first-ever Try Veg Week—organized by Compassion Over Killing—Raskin got the needed push, and from April 24th through the 30th, Senator Raskin and Takoma Park City Council pledged to go veg. Now, months later, he’s sticking with a meat-free diet, obsessed with Whole Foods’ vegan General Tso’s chicken, and focusing on the environment.

VegNews: Why did you decide to stick with vegetarianism?
Jamie Raskin: Because it made me feel a lot better physically, not so full and engorged after meals. It also made me feel better politically because I finally lined up my menu with my morals. I’ve seen what the poultry industry has done to the Chesapeake Bay and I’m glad not to be implicated personally in the continuing contamination of our most precious estuary by virtue of eating chicken nuggets every day.

VN: How has your daily life changed since going veg?
JR: One thing that surprised me is how vegetarians are everywhere. The week after I launched my bold experiment, two of the people I work with closely at American University Washington College of Law came into my office and said, “Well, it’s about time!” I had no idea they didn’t eat meat. I’ve been overwhelmed by the encouragement and dinner invitations.

VN: Do you feel that it’s important for everyone to try a vegetarian diet?
JR: Any time you eat a salad or lentil soup, you’re trying a vegetarian diet. Trying the diet isn’t the hard part. The hard part is trying to assimilate vegetarianism into your self-image. I really had to face the uncomfortable fact that eating meat is not only easy and ubiquitously reinforced in our culture, but also integrated with our ideas about masculinity. I mean, you feel you’re compromising your manhood when you surrender steak and hamburgers. I recently went to a high-school reunion and some of the old jocks were making fun of me, and I just said, “Hey, going vegetarian is hard; it’s the macho thing to do. You’re not tough enough to go veg.”

VN: Should the US partake in a national meat-free day?
JR: Absolutely. The great thing about pledges, proclamations, and vegetarian days is that they counteract the basic social presumption in favor of meat. They validate changing your mind about it. When I signed my week-long pledge, I said, “If I can eat meat 51 weeks a year, I can go meatless for one week.” That was three months ago and I have found that there is a real community out there.

VN: What other efforts are you making to be eco-friendly?
JR: When I first ran for the Senate in Maryland, I said that I would never talk about the environment as an “issue” because it’s not an issue anymore, if it ever was, but the entire context in which we have to make every decision, whether about stormwater or greenhouse gas emissions or housing or education. I have a 100 percent Environment Maryland rating and am doing whatever I can to green our government and our politics. We are pushing recycling for our highway restaurant complexes, green roofs on schools and universities, innovative storm-water protection, locally grown food in our public schools. We’re going through a real environmental transformation.

SEXIEST VEG OVER 50,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/sexiest-veg-over-50,"AUGUST 2, 2009","Forever out to add sex appeal to the veg message, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) wants to include those over 50. The Sexiest Vegetarian Over 50 contest is underway and aims to showcase how sexy the veg lifestyle can be at any age. One female and one male contestant will be selected and each will receive an Organic Shining Star gift basket. Head over to the PETA Prime website to cast your vote or forward it to your friends who think they’re too old to be veg, along with the recent statement from the American Dietetic Association. You know, the one that says that veg diets are fine for all life stages. "
FARM SANCTUARY BATTLES USDA,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/farm-sanctuary-battles-usda,"AUGUST 2, 2009","Usually when one reads the word “natural,” images of sunshine and health are associated. Unfortunately, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has recently decided that labeling factory-farmed meat as “naturally raised” is acceptable. Farm Sanctuary couldn’t disagree more and is taking on the USDA with its latest campaign. Petitioning the government, Farm Sanctuary points out that factory farm animals live in confined quarters with no access to fresh air or sunlight, and that labeling this meat as “natural” is actually misleading customers. If you’d like to help out the Sanctuary as well as promote animal welfare, head over to their website to sign the petition. Avoiding the meat section in your local grocer is always helpful, too. "
SOY SEATS,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/soy-seats,"AUGUST 2, 2009","Candles are molded from it, it makes a tasty beverage, and it’s the foundation of many meat analogues. What is the mystery ingredient? Soy, and now it’s being used for—believe it or not—car seat cushions. Ford is using this renewable biomaterial for seatbacks and cushions to show the company’s commitment to the environment, and it can be found in nine of its vehicle platforms. Ford even plans to take it a step further and is researching the use of soy flour and soy meal in floor mats, door seals, and underbody shields. The use of soy seats helps decrease Ford’s use of petroleum oil and helps reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. Now they just need to take it a step further to be eco- and animal-friendly by removing leather from all vehicles as well. "
VEG RESTAURANT WATERCOURSE FOODS EXPANDS TO MEXICO,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/veg-restaurant-watercourse-foods-expands-to-mexico,"AUGUST 2, 2009","Imagine waking up well-rested in a beachside cabin, steps from the Pacific Ocean. After taking a few deep breaths of crisp ocean air, you work your way through an energizing breakfast: fresh-squeezed juice, granola, soy yogurt, homemade pastries, and locally roasted coffee. After fueling up and taking in your share of Puerto Escondido’s ocean views, you debate how to spend the day—surf the famous “Mexican Pipeline,” take a culinary tour, or perhaps lounge in a hammock and relax with a good book. Now imagine enjoying all of this for as little as $15 per night. You’re not dreaming: This is Osa Mariposa.

Translated to mean “Bear Butterfly,” Osa Mariposa is the easy-going, good-natured cousin to WaterCourse Foods, a veg landmark in Denver, Colo. Owned by Daniel and Michelle Landes, WaterCourse Foods maintains an award-winning reputation for comfort cuisine, with menu items such as the Buffalo Tofu Sandwich and a selection of vegan milkshakes. The international travel hostel joins the ranks of the Landes’ other successful endeavors, including WaterCourse Bakery and City O’ City. Their first international venture, Osa Mariposa offers guests affordable lodging in a peaceful, scenic town, complete with an on-site chef. Opened with partner Dave Paco, the Landes’ vacation destination is slated for success. VegNews caught up with Daniel to get the dish on this new vacation hot spot.

VegNews: Where does the name “Osa Mariposa” come from?
Daniel Landes: We wanted it to reflect our love of Colorado and Mexico. My wife Michelle has had many incredible encounters with bears in Colorado and Dave connects with butterflies. So there it is—Osa Mariposa.

VN: What inspired you to open an international hostel? How did you choose your location?
DL: Our inspiration came from my family’s love of traveling south and an unquenchable sense of adventure. Michelle, our sons Charley and Henry, and I have been traveling down to Mexico and Central America for the past 10 years. An ex-employee and her husband spent the last few years building the hostel and then decided to become missionaries and had to relinquish all their obligations outside the mission, including the hostel. They called us to see if we interested in purchasing it—we were. We went down to Oaxaca, fell in love, and somehow made it work.

VN: What features make the hostel special?
DL: Our restaurant’s menu is by me and other chefs from our famous vegetarian restaurants, WaterCourse Foods and City, O’ City, in Denver, Colo. Our bar features the local liquor Mezcal, a smokier and mellower version of tequila. Oaxaca itself is a magical destination with lots to explore.

VN: What does the future hold for Osa Mariposa?
DL: Our hopes for Osa Mariposa are for it to become a real destination place for world travelers. I envision nights under the palapa with tables full of people speaking different languages and partying together. I would love for Osa Mariposa to give back to the Oaxaca community; we are seeking out worthy community-service projects to contribute to. I see Osa Mariposa being important to many people’s lives.

INTERVIEW WITH THE MAKERS OF THE BLUEPRINT CLEANSE,https://vegnews.com/2009/8/interview-with-the-makers-of-the-blueprint-cleanse,"AUGUST 2, 2009","As intimidating as cleanses can be, one company is doing everything it can so that all you have to do is drink. Blueprint Cleanse (BPC), based in New York, NY, allows you to order a nutritional juice cleanse for any number of days—depending on you and your willpower. The day you start your cleanse, fresh-pressed juices arrive at your doorstep, all numbered in the order in which to drink them. Our tester discovered that not only is the system easy to follow, but the juices are also downright delicious. Ending the day with a cashew-vanilla-cinnamon smoothie? Divine. VegNews chatted with BPC co-founders to get the nitty gritty on the cleansing company.

VegNews: How did Blueprint Cleanse all begin?
Zoe Sakoutis + Erica Huss: We created BPC for ourselves and the many like-minded people who live at a demanding pace, but are searching for a practical, accessible system of cleansing to help them maintain their health and balance.

VN: How is BPC different from other cleanses or detox programs?
ZS+EH: What’s different about BPC is that our juices and nut milks are made with 100-percent fresh fruits and vegetables and are never pasteurized. It is a nutritional cleanse. Most people have forgotten or never really known what fresh juice is. Flash pasteurized still means you’re cooking the juice, destroying the natural enzymes. We only deliver pure, unadulterated juice. We use a special hydraulic press that yields a far superior product than standard juicers, allowing live enzymes to stay intact for an extended period. Each day’s supply features six 16-ounce bottles of juice with flavors like pineapple-apple-mint and spicy lemonade.

VN: The cleanses cost $65 per day. Why should people choose BPC over cleansing on their own?
ZS+EH: It comes down to our mantra of “We Think. You Drink.” We didn’t just whip together some tasty juices and put them in bottles. They are specifically made with fruits and vegetables for maximum cleansing benefits, as well as aiding in the function of many of our other parts. Clients also find having the support of our team and guidance they receive to be instrumental in helping them get through their cleanse. While the cost might seem steep, if you tried to recreate this quality of juice at home, it would be a major investment in the hydraulic juicer for a start, not to mention the amount of time and money you’d have to spend to get the equivalent of 15 pounds of produce into each day’s worth of juice.

VN: How do you see customers utilizing the cleanses? Once in a blue moon or once a month?
ZS+EH: In a perfect world for most people we would recommend doing a cleanse once a month for at least three days. This allows your body the proper rest and recovery time it needs to maintain optimum health. We know that’s not doable for everyone, so we also recommend cleansing when you’re experiencing fatigue/general lack of energy, sleeplessness, anxiety/depression, digestive problems, at the first sign of a cold and of course, the always dreaded (yet loved) holiday indulging.

BOLIVIA BANS CIRCUS ANIMALS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/bolivia-bans-circus-animals,"JULY 31, 2009","For years, animal-rights activists have been fighting to make people and governments aware of the horrific treatment of circus animals. Though kids and families may get pleasure from seeing animals perform various tricks, government officials in Bolivia finally recognize the use of animals in circuses as nothing more than an act of cruelty. In the world’s first ban on all animals—wild and domestic— in circuses, Bolivia is giving operators one year from July 1, 2009 to stop usage. Thanks to an undercover investigation by Animal Defenders International, the law was proposed and passed. Authorities will now be monitoring operators to ensure that they don’t eliminate the animals by killing them. Any violations or infractions will warrant a fine, and the authorities have the right to confiscate animals if need be. Perhaps Bolivia’s bold move will open the eyes of other bodies of government around the globe as well. "

After watching contests prepare countless meat-based meals for reality TV cooking shows, chefs will actually prepare a vegan meal on the show Top Chef Masters. Actress Zooey Deschanel will be a guest, and along with being vegan, she is gluten intolerant and soy-free. It should be exciting to see what plant-based meals these chefs whip up for her and her closest friends, so tune into Bravo to see how it goes down. Here’s hoping that the chefs do their homework and get it right! "
FLAT-BED FARM,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/flat-bed-farm,"JULY 30, 2009","With city dwellers able to step outside the office at lunch and find a killer taco truck or even a gussied-up veggie dog, it seems as though truck food is making a huge comeback. In Brooklyn, however, citizens have been able to get food from a truck of a different kind. Filmmakers Curt Ellis and Ian Cheney took a cue from urban rooftop farming and decided they could make a garden out of a truck bed. Filming their success with growing and selling assorted veggies with a solar-powered camera, Truck Farm the film is currently in the works. The truck even has its own CSA following with members paying $20 for their share of greens. Be on the lookout for the film’s winter release to see how the filmmakers give a whole new meaning to food-on-the-go. "
NANOTECHNOLOGY TO FIGHT OBESITY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/nanotechnology-to-fight-obesity,"JULY 29, 2009","Most animal products are bad for you—they’re full of cholesterol and are linked to certain types of cancer. Still, people want a way around this inconvenient fact. Scientists are now attempting to use nanotechnology, the manipulation of matter at a scale one-1000th the width of a human hair, to tranform milkshakes and mayonnaise into healthy foods that fight cancer and reduce obesity. By manipulating the food’s structure, techniques could be developed to deliver delicate vitamins to a certain area in the digestive tract. Also, droplets of fat that aren’t bad for consumers could be created. This vision of nanotech foods is far from completion, but in the meantime, the perfect low-fat and nutrient-dense foods are out there—they’re called fruits and vegetables. "
VEG COOKING COMPETITION,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/veg-cooking-competition,"JULY 29, 2009","A new cooking challenge is about to take vegan food preparation to a whole new level. An Iron Chef-style competition named Veggie Conquest will take place in New York City each month, and contestants will prepare a vegan dish at home that will incorporate a secret ingredient provided by Veggie Conquest. The hopeful chefs will then bring the dish to a selected venue to be judged and tasted for prizes and prestige. The first competition will feature bloggers Joshua Katcher and Kathy Patalsky and food stylist Brian Preston-Campbell as judges. As the Iron Chef would say, whose cuisine will reign supreme? "

Nominations for the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards have just been released, and Whale Wars has received a nod. Nominated for “Outstanding Cinematography For Nonfiction Programming,” the show that follows the ever-courageous Sea Shepherd is pitted against Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, Deadliest Catch, Expedition Africa, and This American Life. The five cinematographers on-board have managed to capture hours of captivating footage from the Shepherd’s encounters with the Japanese whaling fleet. Tune into the Emmy’s on September 20 on CBS to see if they can also capture an award. "
SOY CUTS STROKE RISK,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/soy-cuts-stroke-risk,"JULY 28, 2009","Whoever out there is still weary of soy better take a good look at a new study published in Neuroepidemiology. New research confirms that the more soy you consume, the greater your chance is for reducing stroke risk. Research found that consuming 50 grams of soy products a week reduces stroke risk, while consuming 50 to 300 grams results in an even greater drop. The greatest health benefits come with consuming 300 grams or more per week. The study was conducted in Southern China but the effects should be the same with Western diets, says Colin Binns, a professor at Curtin University of Technology who led the research. So, spread the good word about the bean curd! "

VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN GRANTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/vegan-and-vegetarian-grants,"JULY 28, 2009","Other than feeling better, potentially lowering your cholesterol, and gaining the sense of peace that comes with knowing that no animals died for your meal, shouldn’t there be some sort of compensation for maintaining a veg diet? Two new veg funds for the elderly are here to add to the rewards. Veggies who are over the age of 65 are eligible for a grant of almost $5,000 in the UK. The grants are offered by Vegetarian for Life (VFL), an advocacy group for older vegetarians and vegans, and will provide ramps, grab handles, minor kitchen and bathroom adaptations, and more. The goal is to help independent living—VFL thinks that senior veggies stay out of care homes more often than non-veg seniors because they are healthier and independent-minded. "
COK TAKES ON DUNKIN’,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/cok-takes-on-dunkin,"JULY 27, 2009","As the slogan says, “America runs on Dunkin’.” Compassion Over Killing, a Washington, DC-based animal advocacy organization, recognizes that, and thinks America needs to run on Dunkin’ Donuts, veganized. With an estimated 6,400 stores in the US alone, Dunkin’ is providing everyone with plenty of egg- and milk-laden dough. Little do consumers know that the eggs in all 52 varieties of doughnuts come from hens in factory farms, where living space for animals is minimal and harmful. COK is pushing Dunkin’ to revamp its menu and supply vegan options for the masses. Join the Dunkin’ Cruelty campaign by heading to COK’s site and contacting Dunkin’ headquarters. Doughn’t delicious, sweet, ethical doughnuts sound like the kind of fuel on which Americans should run? "
SILVERSTONE’S ECOTOOLS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/silverstones-ecotools,"JULY 27, 2009","Alicia Silverstone, vegan actress and activist, seems to be doing it all these days. Not only is the stage beauty heading to Broadway, but she’s also managing to find time to pair up with EcoTools to create a new line of natural beauty supplies. EcoTools is a flourishing company that supplies beauty products that are eco- and animal-friendly, and with Silverstone on-board, the company will be releasing her line of hemp-based beauty supplies and bags with recycled lining in December. The five-piece brush set and bag may be enough to hold her stage makeup as she travels from LA to NYC at the end of the year—how fashionable and ethical. "
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE DELIVERY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/fruit-and-vegetable-delivery,"JULY 27, 2009","Eating healthy doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg, but what if you live in an area surrounded by fast-food restaurants with no supermarket? Clacton pretty much fits that definition and was named among the most deprived five percent of wards in the UK in 2004. The National Health Service (NHS) has a plan to get healthy options to the area: Vans will deliver produce to areas in Clacton where poor health is a problem. The vehicles will be filled with fruit and vegetables that will be sold door-to-door at reduced prices. Not only will the NHS provide healthy foods, they will also provide recipe suggestions and possibly cooking clubs and tasting sessions. Now, when will this new plan be imported to the states? "
MAGUIRE PUSHES VEG OPTIONS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/maguire-pushes-veg-options,"JULY 26, 2009","Tobey Maguire—the vegetarian actor of Spiderman fame—is doing much more than webbing from building to building these days. Taking a stand for public school students, Maguire sent a letter to US Representative Nancy Pelosi pushing lawmakers to re-evaluate the Child Nutrition Act standards. As the act already is to be re-authorized this fall, Maguire made a move at a smart time. In his letter, he notes that the government’s food programs distribute surplus beef to schools, which then end up with menu items such as beef nachos. In lieu of the unhealthy and unethical food options, Maguire suggests veggie burgers in their place. Helping kids eat healthfully and ethically is certainly a superhero effort. "
BAD FOR BOWELS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/bad-for-bowels,"JULY 26, 2009","And now for another reason to skip red meat and encourage family and friends to do so, too. A report published online in the journal Gut says that consuming too much linoleic acid—which is a fatty acid found in beef, pork, sunflower oil, and some margarines—can increase the risk of ulcerative colitis, a serious bowel condition. The illness causes inflammation in the bowels and can be disabling, and smaller amounts of the fatty acid are found in fish and white meat. Ulcerative colitis isn’t common, but if you want to keep your bowels healthy, be weary of those foods high in linoleic acid. "
DECIPHERING FOOD LABELS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/deciphering-food-labels,"JULY 25, 2009","With our jam-packed schedules and supermarket shelves filled with a cornucopia of vegetarian convenience foods, it’s often easy to choose the quick-prep, prepackaged route for easy eating. While whole foods are undoubtedly full of nutrients, faster-food alternatives can’t be that bad, right? Unfortunately, many of these items are full of any combination of processed flour, sugar, salt and oil—the very culprits that lead to obesity and ill health in mainstream omnivores. Commonly used labels like “organic,” “trans-fat free,” and “all-natural” invite consumers to indulge, providing a safety blanket of health-conscious endorsements. Even the most educated consumers can fall prey to masterful marketing. While some products may, in fact, be healthy, many labels can be misleading. Read on for VegNews’ guide to some of the most commonly used packaging language. “No Trans Fat”
Trans fats are definitely something to avoid. Over the years, consumption of trans-fatty acids has been linked with diabetes, coronary heart disease, and sudden cardiac death. Looking for a “no trans fat” label on your food is a step in the right direction. But beware—the FDA allows products to contain half a gram of trans fat and still be labeled “zero.” The key is in the ingredients list: partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is a red flag. In addition, “no trans fat” does not mean that the product is free of artery-clogging saturated fats, nor does it mean that the product is low-fat. “Fruit Sweetened”
When we think of fruit, we think of a healthy part of our daily diets, and rightly so. So if a product is sweetened with fruit sugars, it’s logical to conclude that the product is also a much healthier alternative to one sweetened any other way. However, as far as the human body is concerned, sugar is sugar is sugar, no matter what the source. There really is no “healthy” sugar, and this includes “natural” sweeteners. As a general rule, try to limit foods with added sugars. “100 Percent Organic”
Organic products have been grown in accordance with organic standards—without the use of irradiation, genetic modification, pesticides, sewage sludge, or artificial fertilizers. This is great news for your health; eating organic products will certainly keep you from consuming hidden food dangers. Remember, though, that organic foods can still be fried, sugary, and full of ingredients that give little nutritional bang for their caloric buck. “All Natural”
The FDA held a 1970 proceeding to define the then-blossoming label “natural,” but has yet to regulate the term nearly 40 years later. Without regulation, the updated “all natural” term can be slapped on just about any product on supermarket shelves and still contain large amounts of decidedly unnatural ingredients. What does all this mean for those who want to have their vegan cake and eat it, too? Should we just give up on our beloved meat analogs, crackers, and cookies? Absolutely not. Just read labels and make sure that you understand all of the ingredients in your food. This way, you can make informed decisions on what you’re consuming. Monitor portion sizes, eat plenty of whole foods, and make sure you get at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day. If you’re doing all this, you can safely include your favorite foods into your diet, in moderation. Because let’s face it—we could all use a cookie now and then. "
DAIRY-FREE ICE CREAM DAY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/dairy-free-ice-cream-day,"JULY 24, 2009","National holidays are only fun when you can partake in the festivities. That’s why Turtle Mountain, makers of non-dairy milks, ice creams, and yogurts, are stepping in and trying to help those who don’t do dairy. Established by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, every third Sunday in July is National Ice Cream Day. Twenty-five years later, we now know that over 50 million Americans can’t consume dairy, whether it’s for lactose intolerance or ethical reasons. To jump-start the campaign for the fourth Sunday in July to be National Non-Dairy Ice Cream Day, Turtle Mountain is doling out free frozen delights at Alton Baker Park in Eugene, Ore., on Sunday, July 26, 10am to 4pm. To help Turtle Mountain (and millions of Americans) win President Obama’s favor, head over to the park for a free sample and to sign the petition! "
HOTDOG WARNING LABEL,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/hotdog-warning-label,"JULY 23, 2009","No matter which way you cut it, hotdogs just aren’t good for your health—a fact that most veggies know. But is the general public aware that these processed meat foods put consumers at risk for colorectal cancer? The Cancer Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to cancer prevention, is convinced of the risk and is holding hotdog companies accountable for not providing warning labels on their products. The Cancer Project filed a class-action lawsuit against Nathan’s Famous, Kraft Foods/Oscar Mayer, Sara Lee, ConAgra Foods, and Marathon Enterprises in Essex County, NJ, this week. This group wants the companies to put a label on the foods stating: “Warning: Consuming hot dogs and other processed meats increases the risk of cancer.” If the labels ever become a reality, veggie dogs are plentiful and a perfect alternative for health-conscious consumers. "
VEGAN WELLNESS CENTER,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/vegan-wellness-center,"JULY 23, 2009","“Vegan” and “wellness” go together like peas and carrots—studies on living animal-free prove again and again how healthy this lifestyle option is. The Ritz-Carlton, Charlotte, is scheduled to open in October this year and has taken the hint. The hotel will have a wellness center that incorporates Eco-Luxe treatments and all of its products will be organic and vegan. The hotel is making a good effort to be sustainable and will reduce water usage with high-efficiency plumbing fixtures and with complimentary transportation in hybrid vehicles. Now, if only the hotel would go that extra step and get rid of the leather furniture and BLT Steak Restaurant, then they’d be truly sustainable. "
VEGAN PIZZA REVOLUTION,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/vegan-pizza-revolution,"JULY 23, 2009","For years, vegans have been able to enjoy pizza alongside their non-veg friends, but it was always missing something: that ooey-gooey, chewy cheese topping that blends so perfectly with delicious dough and fresh veggies. “Cheeseless pizza” no longer has to be in vegans’ ordering repertoire—Daiya cheese is here to save the day. Made from cassava, this vegan cheese has the ability to melt and stretch just like its dairy counterpart. Los Angeles pizzerias have quickly jumped on the new product, most notably with Cruzer Pizza using the cheese with its faux-meats, and even adding vegan calzones, macaroni and cheese, and lasagna to its menu. Since having started to use Daiya mozzarella, Cruzer has seen a 63 percent sales increase in its Los Feliz store, and vegan items have outsold all other menu items. We sense a pizza revolution. "
VEGAN ULTRAMAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/vegan-ultraman,"JULY 22, 2009","For anyone who has ever thought a solely plant-based diet is not enough for successful athletes, think again. Rich Roll was your average busy American: full-time lawyer, husband, and father. On the cusp of his 40th birthday, Roll took a good look in the mirror, didn’t like what he saw, and decided it was time for an overhaul. His makeover started with a seven-day juice cleanse, which then led him to what he believes is the optimal long-term diet: veganism. He also reacquainted himself with regular exercise. Two years later and 30 pounds lighter, Roll competed in the Ultraman World Chamionships, a race in which competitors swim 6.2 miles, bike 260 miles, and run a 52.4-mile double marathon. Now named by Men’s Fitness as one of the “25 Fittest Guys in the World” in 2009, it’s clear that vegan athletes can and will leave competitors eating their dust. "
WAL-MART’S GREEN PLAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/wal-marts-green-plan,"JULY 22, 2009","Though Wal-Mart is often controversial, the mega store’s latest move is toward transparency. Consumers may be able to know how good a product is (or isn’t) for the environment just from reading its label. Wal-Mart executives are looking to create a universal system that rates exactly how environmentally and socially sustainable products are. Ideally, each item will include information about its carbon footprint, the gallons of water used to produce it, and the air pollution created by its making and shipping. Working in the same manner nutrition information does, Wal-Mart’s goal is for this rating system to be universal among all retailers. There’s no word yet on whether meat and dairy products will be labeled in the same manner. Now wouldn’t that be good? "
SILVERSTONE ON BROADWAY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/silverstone-on-broadway,"JULY 22, 2009","Long gone are the Clueless days of “as if” and plaid skirts with Mary Janes. Alicia Silverstone, known for being a long-time animal-rights activist and vegan and for her role in the aforementioned ’90s comedy, is taking the stage in New York. Having just starred in the LA production of Time Stands Still, a play about a journalistic couple’s return to New York after reporting from the Middle East, Silverstone will help the play make its Broadway debut. Silverstone will be heating up the stage as a younger woman who woos the male lead from his wife. To catch the vegan star in action, grab tickets for the show’s official opening in January 2010.

NATURAL GRASS FOR DAIRY COWS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/natural-grass-for-dairy-cows,"JULY 21, 2009","Livestock is called one of the most serious near-term threats when it comes to climate change, says the United Nations. Now that this threat is being recognized, some farms in New England are attempting to reduce cow emissions by switching up cow feed from corn and soy to alfalfa and flaxseed. The latter replicates spring grasses that cows have evolved to digest and therefore reduces the methane that cows emit. With the United Nations estimating that factory farming is more dangerous to the atmosphere than all modes of transportation combined, perhaps those who aren’t currently veg should consider a diet switch as well. "
EAT YOUR VEGETABLES!,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/eat-your-vegetables,"JULY 21, 2009","A parliamentary inquiry addressing food shortages says that Britain must grow more fruit, vegetables, and grains. The inquiry recognizes that more grains will be used to feed livestock and poultry in the future, and to stimulate higher fruit and vegetable production, consumers are encouraged to eat “5 a day” portions of fruit and vegetables. For those who are sticking to meat and dairy, Members of Parliament (MPs) believe that those consumers should be made aware of the impact that those industries have on the environment. MPs also say to lay off the fish and that the government’s promotion of eating two portions per week should be reconsidered due to declining fish stocks. "
MILLS BUYS VEGAN COMPANY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/mills-buys-vegan-company,"JULY 21, 2009","Heather Mills seems to be unstoppable lately. Fresh from launching her vegan café, VBites, Mills has just acquired The Redwood Wholefood Company, based in the UK. Operating five food lines, Redwood Co. creates natural, GMO-free vegan deli meats, cheeses, sausages, fish-style alternatives, organic faux-meats and schnitzels, and even non-dairy fudge. Rod Garland, director of Redwood Co., says that Mills is going to help the company flourish globally, as she has a strong passion to promote veganism through her restaurants and brands. Having just won in the Best Meats category in the 2009 Vegan Environmental Awards, it’s no wonder Mills is calling her recent acquisition “a dream come true.” "
MEXICO WORST VEG DESTINATION,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/mexico-worst-veg-destination,"JULY 20, 2009","Though most vegetarian and vegan globetrotters like to optimistically believe that they’ll be able to find good veg grub in every country and city, the unfortunate truth is that it’s not always easy. According to editors and members of VirtualTourist.com, Mexico came in first place for the “top five worst places for vegetarians and vegans” for 2009. The organization says that the problem with Mexican fare is that it poses challenges with the abundance of both meat and cheese. Filling in places two through five were Spain, Germany, Cuba, and central Asian nations. Perhaps with preparation, vegetarians and vegans will still be able to enjoy a little Mexican fiesta getaway.

VEGETARIAN LICENSE PLATES,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/vegetarian-license-plates,"JULY 20, 2009","When drivers want to make a statement with their cars, they usually plaster the trunk with bumper stickers. Now, residents of Virginia may soon be able to get their message across with a brand-new, special license plate. With the forces of the Richmond Vegetarian Festival, Vegan Action, and the Vegetarian Society of Richmond, a specific license plate for vegetarians and vegans may be available to Virginians. The proposed plates will read “vegetarian” or “vegan” and will feature reasons as to why people live their lives veg. In order to make the plates a reality, 350 prepaid applications are to be submitted by October 15, 2009, alongside the design package. By then, let’s hope Virginians can pimp their rides, veg-style.

VEGETARIAN ROBOT,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/vegetarian-robot,"JULY 20, 2009","Despite public concern about a robot that eats human bodies, flesh eating-robot fears are unfounded for now as Robotic Technology Inc.’s Energetically Autonomous Tactical Robot (EATR) only consumes meat-free materials. The EATR will not eat humans or animals, and Bob Finkelstein, the president of RTI, says that the robot will be programmed to recognize vegetable materials: “There are certain signatures from different kinds of materials that would distinguish vegetative biomass from other material.” The robot will be able to roam for months and fuel itself with twigs and grass clippings. Well, that is unless this plant-based robot discovers the vast array of yummy vegan food currently on the market. "

INTERVIEW WITH MAT & NAT’S INDER BEDI,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/interview-with-mat-andamp-nats-inder-bedi,"JULY 20, 2009","Ever daydreamed of owning your own, vegan business? Of course! Who wouldn’t want a career in line with the call to be passionately committed to the veg lifestyle? By following your ethics as well as your bliss, business can really boom. Case in point? How about Matt & Nat, the ultra-hip, totally glam accessory line that can be seen on A-listers all over, and proves once again that living a veg life does not mean sacrificing. With a new sister line, Samsara, just launched earlier this year, you might say that the company has success in the bag. Inder Bedi, founder of Matt & Nat, chatted recently with VegNews about starting vegan company, building ethics into every aspect of a business, and how success enables him to give back. VegNews: How has being a vegan company—and one that promotes veganism—affected your business?
Inder Bedi: Very rewarding on a personal level, but difficult sometimes in fashion circles in the past when you have to explain how the quality of synthetics are comparable to leather, etc. They are more open minded these days as veganism is starting to be recognized as a green movement and many retailers are seeking eco-responsible products. VN: Would you say that the majority of your customers are attracted to the fact that your bags are cruelty-free, or are they simply interested in the high-fashion look?
IB: Our customers are more interested in the look, however they do appreciate the fact that the company stands for something beyond dollars and cents. VN: How do you see your role in the business world, as someone who is actively making eco-friendly, vegan products high-fashion and highly desirable?
IB: I often take on the role of marketing spokesperson, educating all different partners of the business—especially retailers—the importance of balancing fashion with social responsibility. This is important to myself on a personal level first and it has also become our niche approach. VN: Matt & Nat seems to be thriving, to what do you most attribute your success?
IB: People recognize the positivity in our company and products, our customers have been the biggest ambassadors of our brand, our approach has been grassroots and underground, and we also have a great team for all aspects of business from design to logistics. VN: As a successful business, what kind of responsibility do you have to give back to the community?
IB: We give back to many different types of charities all over North America and Europe, from animal-rights to battered women’s shelters to feeding 400 homeless people a vegetarian meal twice a year in Montreal. An example of all this is a new brand we just launched, Samsara. One dollar for every bag sold goes to the charity of your choice. In three months since the launch, we’ve already committed more than $16,000!

INTERVIEW WITH VEG CYCLING SUPERSTAR CAT JOHNSON,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/interview-with-veg-cycling-superstar-cat-johnson,"JULY 16, 2009","OrganicAthlete, an organization set up in 2003 to “create a better world through sport,” brings together professional athletes to promote the health and environmental benefits of a vegan diet. Among its activists is Cat Johnson, a cyclo-crosser who is wheeling her way up the biking ranks. Johnson originally joined the vegan world for animal-rights reasons. ”I just didn’t want to cause any unjust suffering,” she says. After she became vegan, Johnson started marathon running and then short-track bicycling. This segued to cyclo-cross, a hybrid of cycling and running.

Now one of the fastest, literally, up-and-coming stars of cyclo-cross, the only suffering she inflicts is on herself during her challenging workouts. Constantly growing stronger and faster, Johnson took some time off the bike to catch up with VegNews and share how she fuels her powerhouse self.

Sport: Cyclo-cross
Diet: Vegan since 1998
Recent record: I won my first Omnium [a track cycling race in which cyclists compete in five different disciplines] in the spring. It was the first one I had ever done! Then we had a Women’s Series, which I also won. We started racing in Colorado Springs about a month ago, at the 7-11 Olympic Training Center Velodrome. It has been awesome! I am doing a solid job in those races, but they are at a high level with a lot of very experienced track racers, so they are tougher and it’s a steep learning curve, for sure! I went from being a Cat 5 on the Track to being a Cat 2 (Cat 1 being the level just below Pro. I’m not quite there, yet!) in just 6 months from when I started learning to ride at the Velodrome in January. I definitely think my vegan diet is keeping me strong, feeling good, and recovering between races very well. It keeps me really lean, and I need to be as lean as possible to race at high speeds.
Staple meal: A good sandwich with avocado and a smoothie.
Weekly workouts: Some people think I am a little over-extended this summer. I race on the road often on Saturday and Sunday, race my mountain bike on Wednesday in the hardest Women’s category, and then race track all night on Thursdays with the hard-core track girls. But I am having the time of my life, and feeling great! I definitely am attributing this to my vegan diet and my conscious choices to get in a lot of calories, and stay healthy by also getting things like omega-3s in flaxseed oil, omega-6s in pistachios, and omega-9s in avocados. My smoothies now typically consist of fruit, soy ice cream, flaxseed oil, Vega, and Hemp Protein Powder from Living Harvest.
Favorite supplement: Brendan Brazier’s Vega Complete Whole Food Health Optimizer because it has a lot of great nutrients in it that I know make me stronger and faster! Hemp powder has all the complete proteins I could ever want and need, so that is a change in my diet that I think has been really positive and has made me a better, and quickly improving athlete.

BOSTON ZOO TO CLOSE,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/boston-zoo-to-close,"JULY 15, 2009","The Franklin Park Zoo may have to close its doors. Facing extreme budget cuts by Governor Patrick Degal, zoo officials say they will run out of money by October and will be forced to shut down two locations, one in Franklin Park and one in Stoneham. Already searching for solutions for the animals, the zoo officials say they’ve only found homes for 80 percent of the animals, and those without placement are to be euthanized. Though the plans to close are not yet finalized, it’s certain that the situation is dire for the animals. "
VEG DINNER WITH CLINTON,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/veg-dinner-with-clinton,"JULY 15, 2009","How would you like to dine with former President Bill Clinton? And, more importantly, how would you like a spectacular veg meal? The Art for Life Garden Party Benefit scheduled for July 18 will offer attendees the chance to have a plant-based meal with the former president. A vegan dinner with Bill Clinton will be auctioned off, and the meal will take place at Russell Simmons’ private residence in New York on July 20. There will be 35 other guests in attendance and proceeds will benefit Simmons’ Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation, which connects disadvantaged youth with art programs. A great meal with the former decider that also supports a great cause—sounds like a win-win-win. "
EARTH-FRIENDLY FILM,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/earth-friendly-film,"JULY 15, 2009","How did the majority of people come to recognize the problem of climate change? It is now viewed as a serious threat, and Robert Stone’s new film Earth Days, a documentary about the environmental movement, aims to show the steps we took to get to this point. The film, which is set to open in theaters soon, is a Sundance Official Selection and features personal testimonies as well as rare archival footage. Featured in the film are Former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, biologist Rusty Schweickart, and renewable energy pioneer Hunter Lovins. It’s certain to make viewers appreciate just how far we’ve come with going green. "
MEET THE ANIMALS OF FARM SANCUTARY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/meet-the-animals-of-farm-sancutary,"JULY 15, 2009","It’s time for another round of recent rescues. This week our featured four-legged and feathered friends hail from Farm Sanctuary, which has two locations—one in Watkins Glen, NY, and another in Orland, Calif. One of the many perks of eating a meatless meal is that you can be sure that no cuties like these were harmed in its making. Gideon the Turkey
Gideon’s story: This feathery guy was left to suffer under the sweltering summer sun in a cardboard box with three turkey pals. With no food or water, these baby birds would’ve succumbed to the heat if it weren’t for a kindly couple that took them home and nursed them back to health. Gideon now resides at Farm Sanctuary’s California-based shelter.
Favorite food: Grapes! And you can’t go wrong with bananas or pumpkins either.
Best buddy: Gobbell, a resident turkey at Farm Sanctuary who showed Gideon the ropes when he first arrived.
Favorite way to show off: Gideon loves to greet and dazzle visitors with his brilliant white plumage. Ady the Sheep
Ady’s story: Wendy, Ady’s mother, was rescued from a muddy roadside ditch in Sacramento and was in desperate need of medical attention when she arrived at Farm Sanctuary’s California shelter—she survived her ordeal and gave birth to not one, but two beautiful baby sheep: Colvin and Ady. Poor Ady didn’t arrive in the best of health either—he showed signs of respiratory distress and impaired mobility. Despite his rough start, Ady has recovered and is livin’ it up on the farm.
Best buddy: Colvin, Ady’s twin brother.
Ady’s heroes: The folks at the University of California, Davis Veterinary Hospital for Animals who supplied Ady with lifesaving oxygen and antibiotic treatments.
Favorite place to sleep: On a big heapin’ bed of straw. The Doctor
The Doctor’s story: This little pig was one of the most injured animals rescued from the Iowa floods last summer. Trapped on a levee for weeks without food or clean water, the doctor’s sensitive skin was burned by the scorching sun and he suffered from pneumonia. Tended to by Farm Sanctuary National Shelter Director Susie Coston, The Doctor has made a full recovery.
How The Doctor got his name: During Farm Sanctuary’s search-and-rescue operation in Iowa, Susie recalls one little pig who would put his head on her shoulder and talk while she was caring for the other pigs. It was if he was giving her directions on how to treat them. She asked him, “What are you? A doctor?” And the rest is history.
Best buddy: Susie Coston. The Doctor likes to plop his 350-pound frame in Susie’s lap whenever she comes to visit. Boba the Chicken
Boba’s story: Two young sisters found Boba (pictured above) nesting under a bush … in Manhattan’s Fort Tryon Park! The girls and their family knew they could not accommodate Boba in their Big Apple walk-up, no matter how cuddly she was, and allowed Farm Sanctuary to take the feathered fugitive in. Boba now resides in their New York shelter.
Boba’s new family: A flock of about 50 other rescued chickens.
Favorite activity: Taking a nice, long and relaxing sunbath. Need more cute? Check out the recent rescues at Pigs Peace, Animal Acres, Animal Place, and Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary. "
FIELDER WINS HOME RUN DERBY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/fielder-wins-home-run-derby,"JULY 14, 2009","Who says meat-free athletes can’t whoop their omnivorous counterparts when it comes to sports? Prince Fielder, a vegetarian athlete, won the 24th annual Home Run Derby. He’s a first baseman who happens to be the youngest player in Major League history to score 50 homeruns in a single season. The man who cleaned up the competition with 23 homeruns total also cleaned up his diet after his wife showed him the best-selling book, Skinny Bitch. The information about animals’ mistreatment in factory farms convinced Fielder to cut meat out of his diet for ethical reasons. No animals suffered in the making of this homerun victory. "
UK TO HARNESS WIND ENERGY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/uk-to-harness-wind-energy,"JULY 14, 2009","Though it’s often to blame for a dreaded bad hair day or a stressful car ride, wind is Britain’s answer to cutting carbon dioxide emissions. With the Renewable Energy Strategy, released Wednesday, July 15, the UK government plans to quadruple the number of wind turbines over the next decade. Part of the plan may include 4,000 turbines placed on high ground for all to see, and 3,000 turbines built at sea set to cut 34 percent of CO2 emissions by 2020. At the moment, the UK boasts 2,327 onshore wind turbines that supply enough wattage to power 840 homes. Perhaps with the release of the Renewable Energy Strategy the UK’s carbon dioxide woes will be gone with the wind. "
MILLS OPENS VBITES,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/mills-opens-vbites,"JULY 14, 2009","Yet another all-veg eatery is available for ethical eaters in the UK—Heather Mills’ vegan café, VBites, is now open for business. Earlier this month, the 41-year-old climbed up a ladder to announce the restaurant’s opening from its rooftop, and she was sporting a short new ‘do. The menu offers meals with meat substitutes, baked goods, and vegan soft-serve ice cream. The restaurant has a cake and coffee bar as well. Mills has also launched a line of frozen meals with the VBites moniker that features meat analogs such as breaded fish-style fingers and fish cakes. These foods can only be shipped to destinations within the UK—as if you really needed two more excuses to cross the pond. "
FACTORY FARM FIRE,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/factory-farm-fire,"JULY 13, 2009","The minimal animal-welfare standards and cramped conditions of factory farms ensures a terrible life for animals, and when it comes to fast-spreading disease or—in this case—fire, these facilities are a deathtrap. Last Thursday, July 9, a fire caused the death of about 800,000 chickens at Cal-Maine Foods in Parmer County, Texas. The chickens were in five houses, and flames engulfed four laying houses while smoke inhalation was the cause of death for chickens in the fifth house. The cause of the fire is uncertain, but an investigation is taking place to determine the fire’s origin. Cal-Maine produces the largest amount of shell eggs in the US, and while the company has suffered some financial loss, it’s important to consider the unfortunate loss of life as well. "
ECO-FRIENDLY TRANSPORTATION,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/eco-friendly-transportation,"JULY 13, 2009","As unglamorous as taking a bus may seem, the truth is that public transportation is the smartest mode of transport when it comes to helping the environment. TransMilenio, a line of low-emission busses in Bogotá, Colombia, has not only helped the flow of traffic and lower smog, but also has reduced green house gas-causing emissions. The busses, known as bus rapid transit (BRT), run like a subway with seven lines and enclosed stations, yet have the accessibility of being above-ground. Since its opening in 2001, TransMilenio has made it possible for the city to remove 7,000 private busses, thus reducing the use of bus fuel and its associated emissions by 59 percent. Developing cities such as Cape Town, Jakarta, Indonesia, and more are looking into adopting the BRT system to make improvements similar to TransMilenio’s. Now that’s smart travel. "
NEWKIRK LAUNCHES LATEST BOOK,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/newkirk-launches-latest-book,"JULY 13, 2009","There may be no better place to launch an animal rights book than a vegan restaurant, which is just what People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) President Ingrid Newkirk did Sunday, July 12. Hosted in the ever-popular and elegant Sublime Natural & Organic Restaurant & Bar, guests sipped wine while listening to Newkirk discuss her experiences with PETA. After enjoying Sublime’s hors d’oeuvres, guests chatted one-on-one with Newkirk and received signed copies of her book, The PETA Practical Guide to Animal Rights, now available nationwide. A night of wine, delicious food, intelligent conversation, and books? Sublime, indeed. "
"CHIPOTLE SCREENS FOOD, INC.",https://vegnews.com/2009/7/chipotle-screens-food-inc,"JULY 12, 2009","Chipotle Mexican Grill was originally put on the foodie map for gut-busting burritos and veg options galore, but now the company is trying to dole out more than just food. In order to promote awareness about the origins of our food, Chipotle is sponsoring free screenings of the film Food, Inc. in 32 US cities. Chipotle strives to provide natural, mostly organic foods with its “Food With Integrity” discipline, and wants to align its positioning with that of Food, Inc., a documentary that unveils the truth behind the US food industry. There’s no word yet on whether you can sneak in Chipotle chips and guacamole into the show. "
MEET THE ANIMALS OF ANIMAL ACRES,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/meet-the-animals-of-animal-acres,"JULY 11, 2009","Living an urban life doesn’t always leave much time for getting down to the farm. We often hear about farmed animals in lifeless statistics, but what about the individuals behind the numbers? They’ve got personality!

Here are some brief profiles from Animal Acres in Acton, Calif. Just who will steal your heart in this compilation of adorable critters? Good luck with picking a favorite—each of these profiles is sure to leave you in a cuteness coma.

Jumper the Pig
Jumper’s story: This little piggy was the runt of the litter at a crate facility in Southern California. She was constantly picked on by the other piglets and even suffered bite wounds. It was a worker who took pity on Jumper and contacted Animal Acres, and she was rescued when she was four weeks old. Jumper is currently the smallest and youngest pig at the sanctuary, but her size certainly doesn’t keep her from running the show!
Favorite food: Chicken feed.
Best way to get at said chicken feed: Wait by the courtyard gate until a new and unsuspecting volunteer opens it. Then, make a beeline for the chicken feed and never look back.
Favorite activity: Rolling over for a nice, long belly rub. She contently snorts while you scratch!

Pinto the Cow
Pinto’s story: Baby Pinto was found in a crate, unable to stand during an undercover investigation of a California calf ranch. The young calf was rushed to Animal Acres for emergency veterinary care and, with treatments and lots of love, made a full recovery. These days Pinto can be found playing chase games with his best buddy Punky and napping in his straw-filled barn.
Best attribute: Pinto’s soulful eyes. They charmed an avid hunter named George on an episode of 30 Days.
Favorite food: Apples—and lots of ‘em!
Favorite thing ever: Never-ending chin scratches.

Judy the Chicken
Judy’s story: Judy was brought to Animal Acres by a family that could no longer care for her, which saved her from the fate of ending up at a livestock auction. Judy has adjusted well and has grown to be very comfortable around people, so much so that she doesn’t mind grabbing a snack from their plates!
Alias: “Picnic chicken,” because of her picnic table antics—she loves to grub on other’s meals when Animal Acres has lunch guests.
Favorite food: Coleslaw smothered in tasty Vegenaise.
Favorite way to get coleslaw: Stealthily approach and jump onto the picnic table if the scent of Vegenaise is in the air. Then, proceed to shamelessly devour the yummy dish in front of the poor lunch guest.

Faith the Goat
Faith’s story: Faith’s mother, Hope, was severely emaciated when she was rescued from an abandoned home. Shortly after arriving at Animal Acres, Hope went into labor and was somehow able to give birth to Faith. Sadly, Hope died after the birth, but Faith was able to thrive and became the center of attention. After being doted on for so long, Faith seems to prefer the company of humans over fellow goats.
Favorite game: King of the Mountain. Faith loves to run to the top of the hill and “defend” her territory from the other goats and sheep.
Most mischievous activity: Always running away when it’s time for bed. All goats and sheep are tucked safely into their barn at night, but Faith thinks she’s the exception! She has to be picked up and carried back to the barn, and some suspect it’s her sneaky way of getting an extra snuggle. Need more cute? Check out the recent rescues at Pigs Peace, Animal Place, Farm Sanctuary, and Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary. "
SUMMER GUIDE TO MUSIC AND VEGAN FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/summer-guide-to-music-and-vegan-food,"JULY 11, 2009","All across the country, summer music festivals are about to rock, which means that no matter where you live, we salute you. Of course, no vacation plan would be complete without a sampling of incredible vegan food. Thankfully, any city that has a music festival also has a plethora of veg dining options, all without so much as leaving your hometown. If you’re the more adventuresome type, make like a rock star by hopping in your trusty VW bus—the official touring vehicle for any true concert-goer—and taking this guide with you on the road as you putter across the country on a multi-city tour. Rock out, eat well, and be happy—it’s summer!

Go West, Young Fan
In San Francisco, summer doesn’t really start until August (when the fog finally clears), just in time for the Outside Lands Music & Arts Festival in Golden Gate Park. Beginning August 28, revelers will be steeped in an insanely awesome mix of bands including Pearl Jam, M.I.A, Beastie Boys, and soulful vegan Jason Mraz. The verdant venue is ideal for cycling to and from, and valet bike parking is just one of the perks for greenies. Also on offer will be cell-phone recycling stations, an eco-village with solar stage, and hey: did we mention San Francisco is home to Herbivore and Millennium? Before you get too far away from the West Coast, take a few days in Yosemite National Park. Your eardrums will thank you for treating them to days of peaceful silence as you hike, camp, and climb your way through this breathtaking park. Unleash your inner Ansel Adams and snap up all the panoramic photos you can, then either head home or venture east for the next stop on your cross-country journey.

Mid-West Must-See
With so many killer festivals clustered in the mid-west, it feels a little sad to drive right through Utah, Nevada, and Colorado, but when the 10,000 Lakes Festival north of Minneapolis beckons, well, you gotta do what you gotta do. Headliners at this veg-friendly event include Dave Matthews Band, Ozomatli, and Mason Jennings. The four-day shindig starts July 22, and you’re sure to find your fill of falafel, corn on the cob, lemonade, and French fries at the venue. Of course, if you’re looking for something sweet, take a little trip to the Twin Cities and gobble Go Max Go Foods’ new line of candy bars at Fast and Furless, a vegan emporium where you can also stock up on clothes, shoes, and pretty much anything else you might need to re-enter the urban landscape after your time in the lakes. With just a little extra car time, you can also take in one of the country’s favorite roadside stops, Wall Drug, in Wall, South Dakota. The kitschy superstore advertises itself on billboards for many hundreds of miles in every direction. Resurrecting dime-store days and the trading-post era, Wall Drug is something to behold with a blend of postmodern humor and curiosity.

Great Lakes Loop
Take a quick dip in the Great Lakes and check out its trove of music festivals. Chicago’s predictably awesome Lollapalooza—the definition of which is “something outstanding or unusual”—stays true to its name. It’s not hard to find any number of remarkable events at this massive jamboree. It started as a touring festival but now takes place in downtown Chicago’s Grant Park, slated this year for August 7 to 9. While a veritable bazaar of vendors and artisans makes for great between-sets diversions, the big draw is always the headliners. This summer you can look forward to heavyweights Depeche Mode, The Killers, Kings of Leon, and Jane’s Addiction, just to name a few. Remember The Gaslight Anthem, one of the many bands featured back in our Music Issue? They’ll be playing on Friday! In an effort to make the experience green all around, the vegetarian food options will be plentiful. Don’t miss the Chicago Soydairy booth for all your vegan ice-cream-cone needs. If you can tear yourself away from the stage long enough to venture into Chi-Town, check out The Chicago Diner, Karyn’s Restaurant, and Green Zebra.

Hopefully, tucked safely in your VW’s glove box is that crucial doc that you’ll need for your next concert: your passport. Not only will it come in handy if you’re after affordable healthcare, but it’s also your ticket (well, kind of) to the hottest Canadian music event this summer: Guelph, Ontario’s annual Hillside Festival, July 24 to 26. Festivities include spoken-word artists, workshops, and sensational performances by the likes of Tokyo Police Club and Dancehall Free For All, who you’ve got to love based on name alone. Expect a veritable smorgasbord of veg-food options (hello vegetable roti, African peanut stew, and cool noodle wraps!), but if you choose to stay in town to avoid cramped camping quarters, check out Guelph’s Wild Organic Way Café.

East or Bust
Now that you’ve had the chance to canoodle with the Canucks, you might as well haul east and join the ranks of the Yanks at the Central Park SummerStage from June through August. Held at Rumsey Playfield in Central Park, you’ll find performances by musicians, dancers, filmmakers, comedians, and writers, all free of charge—yes, you read right—courtesy of the City Parks Foundation. The 2009 musician line-up features some heavy-hitters spanning a variety of genres and world cultures. Check out vegan-restaurant owner Chrissie Hynde with her day job (aka The Pretenders), Cat Power, Dinosaur Jr., and others. And foodies, rejoice: the vegan joints in the Big Apple can’t be beat. Ditch your VW for the subway and head to Candle Café or ‘Snice, and then hit up Lula’s Sweet Apothecary for the biggest sundae of your life.

When you’ve had enough of the urban scene, pop over to Connecticut’s Gathering of the Vibes, which has become one of the Northeast’s premier summer-festival destinations. This while. Set for the weekend of July 23 to 26, this musical happening has a dynamite lineup that includes Crosby, Stills & Nash, Guster, Buddy Guy, and more. For a final thrill in the Tri-State area, stop in Jersey for All Points West Music & Arts Festival. APW is a green festival with on-site parking for carpoolers only, and ample veg-friendly fare. 2009 headliners include Vampire Weekend, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Beastie Boys, and frequent Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary supporter Janeane Garofalo. You know what you need after seeing so many spectacular sets? Cupcakes. Hie thee to Sweet Avenue Bakeshop for your post-festival fill of sweets. With daily rotating specials that include such alluring flavors as Cotton Candy, Cinnamon Sticky Bun, Key Lime, and Mocha Madness, there’s sure to be at least a dozen treats with your name on them. Bon (mini) voyage, and bon appetit! "
VEGGIES’ DEMENTIA DEFENSE,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/veggies-dementia-defense,"JULY 10, 2009","Want to keep your brain on the ball? Dr. Robert Williams’ studies suggest that you should eat your veggies. At the British Pharmacological Society’s Summer Meeting in Edinburgh, the doctor made the claim that there is evidence that certain flavonoids (which are chemicals found in and derived from plants) might provide Alzheimer’s patients with therapeutic benefits. Dr. Williams says that there have “been some intriguing epidemiological studies that the consumption of flavonoid-rich vegetables, fruit juices, and red wine delays the onset of the disease.” These findings combined with the recent link between dementia and meat just might push those with cognitive concerns to eat more plant-based meals. "
WINDOWSILL GARDENS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/windowsill-gardens,"JULY 10, 2009","Fresh vegetables are the key to preparing a great tasting meal, but what if you have no space for a garden? The National Trust says there’s always room. The group has launched an initiative across the pond to urge flat owners to grow their own vegetables on their windowsills. Over 600 acres of window space exists in the UK, according to the National Trust, and with just two boxes, anyone can grow a meal. Tips and vegetable recommendations can be found on the group’s website, so take a peek if you want to avoid store-bought vegetables that inevitably will go bad in your refrigerator. "
BROADWAY HOSTS ADOPT-A-THON,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/broadway-hosts-adopt-a-thon,"JULY 10, 2009","Is there a better combination than Broadway musicals and animal adoption? For a chance to mingle with Broadway stars and partake in a cat and dog adopt-a-thon, mark your calendars for the 11th-annual Broadway Barks today, from 3:30 pm to 6:30pm on Shubert Alley. Bernadette Peters and Mary Tyler Moore will be hosting the adopt-a-thon, which benefits New York animal shelters and adoption agencies. At the gathering will be dogs and cats from over 20 animal rescues alongside musical stars from shows such as The Wiz, West Side Story, Guys and Dolls, and Bye Bye Birdie. Grab your checkbook and your camera, and get ready to adopt the day away, Broadway style. "
FAST FOOD’S OFFENSIVE ADS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/fast-foods-offensive-ads,"JULY 9, 2009","After offending women with a sexist advertisement last month, Burger King has now offended Hindus with an ad depicting a deity who’s dangerously close to a meat-based sandwich. In the ad, the Hindu goddess Lakshmi floats above what looks to be a sandwich with ham and cheese—all of which are animal-derived ingredients that strict Hindus never consume. The ad suggests that the Hindu goddess condones and eats meat and the depiction has angered many Hindus. Burger King has withdrawn the poster and has apologized to the Hindu community. With all the focus on BK’s advertising and not on its goods, the company’s food must be as tasteless as its ads. "
CHEESECAKE FACTORY FARM,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/cheesecake-factory-farm,"JULY 9, 2009","Known for enormous portions and a vast variety of cheesecake, The Cheesecake Factory is now becoming known for where it gets its eggs. Behind the effort named “The Cheesecake Factory Farm,” East Bay Animal Advocates are trying to stop the California-based company from using eggs from hens that are confined in battery cages—the very cages the state of California is outlawing in 2015. With locations in 30-plus states and an entire menu page dedicated to “eggs & omelettes,” The Cheesecake Factory Farm needs a lot of help to revamp the chain’s cruel ways. "
PLASTIC BOTTLE BAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/plastic-bottle-ban,"JULY 9, 2009","It’s 2009 and more people than ever before tote an eco-friendly and body-safe Sigg or Klean Kanteen bottle. The truth is, however, that many people across the globe still resort to plastic disposable bottles to get their 64 ounces a day. A town in Australia has had enough. In the first ban of its kind, Bundanoon residents nearly unanimously voted for banning the sale of bottled water. The campaign behind the movement, “Bundy on Tap,” proposes selling reusable bottles at the same price in an effort to ensure that local businesses don’t lose profit. Helping the environment and the water supply? We’ll drink to that. "
DOGFIGHTING RING BUSTED,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/dogfighting-ring-busted,"JULY 8, 2009","The concept of dogfighting seems as barbaric and violent as the gladiatorial games once held in the Colosseum. At least The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) thinks so, and decided to do something about it. On July 8, HSUS combined forces with federal, state, and local authorities to rescue hundreds of dogs from multiple dogfighting operations—it was the largest raid of its kind in the US. Federal and state law enforcement agencies spent the day making arrests and saving dogs in Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas. The dogs are now in Missouri, being cared for and evaluated to conclude which dogs are more suitable for rescue groups or adopters. Either way, the dogs’ new homes will undoubtedly be better than the fighting ring. "
VEGAN FARE ON TOP CHEF,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/vegan-fare-on-top-chef,"JULY 8, 2009","The sixth season of Top Chef has been announced, and the odds of the chefs preparing a vegan meal are up. There has been blatant disregard for veg cooking in previous seasons, but a slated guest appearance by Natalie Portman may have Top Chef showing viewers just how tasty and alluring vegan food can be. Natalie is meat- and dairy-free and has been voted Favorite Vegan Celebrity three years in a row in the Veggie Awards. She even had a vegan shoe line called Té Casan. Additionally, Natalie was also a judge on Project Runway during its eco fashion episode. The new season begins August 26, and here’s hoping Natalie shows them how it’s done. "
ADA PROMOTES VEG OPTIONS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/ada-promotes-veg-options,"JULY 8, 2009","The American Dietetic Association (ADA) is introducing the public to veg alternatives as evidenced by its latest news article titled “Meet the Meatless.” The article puts the nutrition basics up front, stating that veggie burgers contain less fat than hamburgers and are classified as a good source of fiber—meat-based burgers have no fiber. The ADA concludes the terse report with preparation instructions for wary grillers and even provides a Meet the Meatless Nutrition Chart that has nutritional information for top-selling veggie dogs and burgers alongside their meaty counterparts for comparison. With so many yummy alternatives on the market now, the veggie dogs and burgers that consumers choose to introduce themselves to are sure to make a good impression. "
DEFINING FOOD LABELS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/defining-food-labels,"JULY 7, 2009","An unfortunate truth is that as consumers, we sometimes cannot fully trust package labels. What’s labeled as “green” may be anything but what the name denotes. In efforts to turn things around, the Leonardo Academy—a group of self-proclaimed “sustainability experts”—is in the midst of mediating the debate on how to define “sustainable agriculture.” This is a label that may be stamped on foods in the same manner “organic” is placed on so many packages seen today. Labeling woes are only one facet of the overall project named “Sustainable Agriculture Standard Development.” With this plan, the group hopes to establish standards by which success or failure of sustainability of an agricultural crop can be measured. Once the labels are fully defined, consumers will be able to determine whether the product is enough to sustain them—both mentally and physically. "
DAIRY LINKED TO SALMONELLA,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/dairy-linked-to-salmonella,"JULY 7, 2009","Salmonella has sneaked its way back into the food supply again, and this time it’s nestled in various products containing nonfat dried milk, whey protein, fruit stabilizers, and gums (thickening agents). The contamination originated at Plainview Milk Products Cooperative in Minnesota, but affects dozens of companies that obtain ingredients from this same source. Cautious consumers should avoid Malt-O-Meal’s Maple & Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal and Meijer hot chocolate mix—these are just some of the foods that may be contaminated. The recall is expected to expand as FDA investigators work to track the distribution of products. Seeing that the complete range of the contamination is not yet known, this recall may be another good excuse to dump the moo juice. "
ADA’S VEGAN FOOD PYRAMID,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/adas-vegan-food-pyramid,"JULY 7, 2009","Recognizing that as much as 40 percent of the vegetarian population is vegan, the American Dietetic Association (ADA) has introduced a new food pyramid and guide for vegetarians. This new guide has axed the familiar dairy group and instead provides examples of calcium-rich foods for each of the five groups listed: grains, protein-rich foods, vegetables, fruits, and fats. Along with listing cow’s milk as a vitamin D source in the tips for meal planning, ADA suggests daily sun exposure or certain brands of fortified soymilk and breakfast cereals. The tips also say to get a good amount of vitamin B12, whether it is from fortified nutritional yeast and soymilk or a vitamin B12 supplement. With vegan and vegetarian diets finally getting proper representation, the days of the meat-and-dairy pyramid scheme may be over. "
HUMANE SOCIETY UNIVERSITY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/humane-society-university,"JULY 6, 2009","For those who love animals and aspire to work in the nonprofit field, training for your dream job may be only a mouse click away. The Humane Society of the United States will give students the option of hitting the virtual books by offering online courses in animal advocacy and humane leadership, thanks to its new Humane Society University (HSU). Courses will also be offered in Washington, D.C., and HSU will be able to grant a B.S. or graduate degree in animal protection. At least 60 college credits are needed at the freshmen and sophomore level when applying for the program, and a minimum of 120 credits are needed to meet bachelor degree requirements. HSU courses are eight weeks long and worth three academic credits each. With more than 17,000 animal-oriented nonprofits from which to choose, there’s definitely a market for compassion. "
PRESERVATIVES’ SIDE EFFECTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/preservatives-side-effects,"JULY 6, 2009","The preservatives in meat and dairy products that help keep food toxin-free do anything but preserve the health of one’s brain. Published July 6 in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease, US doctors have discovered that preservatives added to cured meats, cheeses, bacon, and ground beef have a direct link to dementia. With the intention of killing toxins in the products, the nitrites actually react with proteins in the meat, which negatively affects human DNA cells related to aging. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s have long been thought to have been due to genetic defect, but new research concludes that environmental factors are more to blame, noting that a large increase in fertilizer and processed food sales coincided with a rising prevalence of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and type two diabetes in the US. Help preserve your brain by chucking the ground chuck. "
SALLEY PROMOTES VEG FOOD LINE,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/salley-promotes-veg-food-line,"JULY 6, 2009","Some basketball players may be known for their height, on-court skills, and after-hours escapades, but one NBA legend is determined to be known for something much more accessible—and delicious. John Salley, the former Los Angeles Lakers championship team member, is now promoting his very own line of all-natural, vegan, and organic snacks and sauces. With options such as John Salley’s Peach Chipotle Sauce, Double-Baked Herb Crisps, and Habañero Pepper Sauce, Salley is sticking to the animal-free lifestyle he promotes in his recent PSA. Knowing that livestock accounts for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, Salley shares his advice to skip the meat. That’s always a slam dunk in our book. "
VEGAN WEDDINGS 2009: JENNIFER JONES & BARRY HORTON,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/vegan-weddings-2009-jennifer-jones-and-barry-horton,"JULY 6, 2009","Jennifer Jones & Barry Horton
Fort Bragg, Calif.

Guests: 90
Price tag: $6,000
Best Wedding Gift: “The attendance and enthusiastic participation by our guests. We had a vegan, gluten-free carnival, and people dressed up and went all-out.”
Tip for success: “Be ready for something to go wrong—there’s always something. Let it be part of the memory!”
Their story: Forget the old “no fraternization” policy—for Jennifer and Barry, their nine-to-five daily grind was the launching pad for true love. Jennifer assisted the owner of the famous vegan B&B, The Stanford Inn. Through her event planning, she worked closely with Barry, chef at the adjoining Raven’s Restaurant. Spending time after-hours brought the two closer together, and eventually their friendship progressed into something more. It was a Thanksgiving celebration that sealed the deal; Jennifer created a scavenger hunt for Barry that led to dinner and a night of board games and fun. She fell for his sense of adventure, and he “realized that I was in love with her, and that this was the woman I would grow with.”

Wedding highlights: Beneath a chuppah created by their entire community, Jennifer and Barry kicked off the celebration with their self-penned service. Friends, family, and companion animals watched as the two—dressed in stylish vintage formal-wear—recited their vows. After the ceremony, guests lost themselves in the carnival-themed celebration, complete with costumes, fortune-tellers, and dance-inducing music. Barry led the execution of a delicious gluten-free menu, upsetting guests only when they were too full to eat any more. Jennifer made sure the event was as green as possible, from bamboo salad bowls to plantable paper programs. Each guest even received a tree start, with 100 percent of the proceeds going to “Trees for Tomorrow.”

METHANE SOLUTION,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/methane-solution,"JULY 5, 2009","With cattle feedlots pumpin’ out methane like there’s no tomorrow, how exactly can we ensure that there will be a tomorrow? Prometheus Energy, a 27-employee company based in Redmond, Wash., proposes that methane be turned into a liquid natural gas, and it’s developed the technology to do so. Funding for this new technology is up $20 million courtesy of the Shell Technology Ventures Fund, a fund that is linked to the largest nongovernmental producer of liquid natural gas in the world. Currently, the company collects waste gas from landfills and coal mines, turns this into methane, and then finally converts it into liquid natural gas. Seeing that this methane problem is attributed to factory farms, where’s the technology to curb America’s unhealthy appetite for beef? "
SMITHFIELD RETRACTS REFORM,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/smithfield-retracts-reform,"JULY 5, 2009","Whenever a large meat company makes a move to improve the lives of animals, it seems as though they deserve kudos for progressive thinking. Smithfield Foods Inc., however, has halted the plans it made in 2007 to better the lives of its farmed hogs. In 2007, Smithfield earned praise from animal rights groups for announcing it would replace gestation crates with roomier “group housing” by 2017, and thus allowing more freedom for pregnant sows. Due to poor business outturn—the company lost $171 million alone in the fourth quarter of 2009—Smithfield says it can’t afford the $300 million transition to group pens. Looks as though Smithfield tried to take a step forward, only to end up two steps back. "
GREENWASHING GETS BIG,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/greenwashing-gets-big,"JULY 5, 2009","A certain peace of mind accompanies purchases when they’re labeled “green” or “eco-friendly.” Not only are you helping the economy, but also the environment and the health of your family. Unfortunately, recent research by TerraChoice reveals that of 4,000 consumer products, nearly every product was a victim of “greenwashing,” or the mislabeling of something as green when it really isn’t. Scot Case, a representative of TerraChoice, informed Congress that 98 percent of supposedly natural and eco-friendly products on the market have labeling that is misleading or false. Urvashi Rangan, a representative for Consumers Union, specifically pointed to “non-toxic,” “natural,” and “fragrance free” as meaningless claims, as they’ve never been defined by the federal government. As anonymous bloggers have shown us we cannot even trust vegan restaurants’ food to be completely vegan, the same goes for “green” products. To be fully eco-conscious, do a little research before shelling out your green. "

CHINA UPS WIND POWER,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/china-ups-wind-power,"JULY 3, 2009","Believe it or not, China might be ahead of the game when it comes to being green. The country is cleaning up its act when it comes to the emission of greenhouse gases and is even vying for the top spot as the largest market for wind turbines—China is set to pass the US this year. Six wind power projects are currently in the works and each has the capacity of more than 16 large coal-fired power plants. China is also one step ahead when it comes to mandating that power companies use renewable sources to produce electricity, as it has had a requirement similar to the one the US recently passed. When it comes to the Earth’s health, there’s nothing wrong with a little healthy competition. "
BONE DENSITY DEBATE,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/bone-density-debate,"JULY 2, 2009","As children, we were constantly advised to drink our milk, or else we wouldn’t have strong bones. As adults, for those who have quit the dairy, an additional concern from others is whether vegans consume enough calcium to prevent weak bones. A recent Australian study published in the American Journal of Nutrition shows that vegans have a five percent lower bone mass density than non-vegans. The worry with low bone density is that it can lead to fractures, but Dr. Tuan Nguyen of Sydney’s Garvan Institute of Medical Research says that of the 2,749 people studied, vegans were no more likely to be treated for bone fractures, pointing to vegans’ tendencies to be generally more health-conscious people. Another bone-woe the study addresses is dairy intake. According to Dr. Rosemary Stanton, calcium is only a small factor in bone density, and the push for massive dairy intake is invalid. Vegans, keep on keepin’ on and guzzle that enriched non-dairy milk. "
GREEN BILL GETS PASSED,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/green-bill-gets-passed,"JULY 2, 2009","After years of activists urging for greener, cleaner air, the US government has decided to take action. On Friday, June 26, US Congress passed the first-ever piece of legislation to address global warming and to begin to metamorphose the way our nation uses and produces energy. The main feature of the bill is a “cap-and-trade” system that will help hamper heat-trapping gasses that lead to climate change. The system sets a limit on overall emission of carbon dioxide and allows utilities and manufacturers to trade pollution permits (allowances) among themselves. These permits will cost about $13 per one ton of carbon dioxide, with prices set to rise as the cap on emissions tightens. To take effect in 2012, this bill will also devote billions of dollars to new energy projects and electricity subsidies for low-carbon agricultural practices. Way to rock the House. "
HOT DOG HEALTH RISK,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/hot-dog-health-risk,"JULY 2, 2009","All eyes will be on President Obama as he throws the first pitch during the 2009 All-Star Game in St. Louis, but the Cancer Project will be vying for attention as well with a new billboard. The digital billboard will feature four hot dogs packed into an “Unlucky Strikes” cigarette box alongside a warning label that reads, “Warning: Hot Dogs Can Strike You Out—for Good.” The nonprofit organization aims to showcase the link between meat consumption and cancer. Cancer Project dietitian Krista Haynes, RD, says that “[l]ike cigarettes, hot dogs should come with a warning label that helps baseball fans and other consumers understand the health risk.” Perhaps patrons will think twice about ordering foot-long brats now that meat has been called out.

ADA SAYS VEG DIET IS HEALTHY,https://vegnews.com/2009/7/ada-says-veg-diet-is-healthy,"JULY 1, 2009","Vegetarians and vegans are often bombarded with questions and accusations that their diets aren’t whole enough. Now veg-heads can put the kibosh on the questioning. The American Dietetic Association (ADA) has just released an updated statement on vegetarian diets in the July issue of its journal that solidifies the facts: vegetarian and vegan diets, when appropriately planned, are “healthful, nutritionally adequate and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.” The ADA also confirms that a veg diet is healthy at all stages of life, from infancy to adulthood. Based on information collected in the ADA Evidence Analysis Library, the ADA additionally verifies that vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index and lower overall cancer rates, along with a slew of other benefits. With the strength of the world’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals behind you, continue to fly your veg flag high! "
"SYNTHETIC TREES, CLEAN AIR",https://vegnews.com/2009/7/synthetic-trees-clean-air,"JULY 1, 2009","In humanity’s quest for instant gratification and ready remedies for its consequences, a new contender has been born. Synthetic trees are in the works to battle climate change, and last month, Columbia University professor Klaus Lackner met with US Energy Secretary Steven Chu to discuss the project. Renderings of the synthetic tree show that the creation will look nothing like an actual tree but will just perform the same function as one, only better—the synthetic tree will gather 1000 times the carbon of a traditional tree and could potentially collect 90,000 tons of carbon per year. Now, that would almost be as good for the environment as switching to a plant-based diet. Almost. "
"VEG DIET, LOWER CANCER RISK",https://vegnews.com/2009/7/veg-diet-lower-cancer-risk,"JULY 1, 2009","On the heels of a US study linking meat to pancreatic cancer, a new study released in the UK says that vegetarians generally have a reduced risk of developing cancers of the blood, bladder, and stomach. Published in the British Journal of Cancer, the study monitored the diets and health of 61,566 British men and women. When it came to lymph and blood cancers, vegetarians were just over half as likely to develop the diseases, and they were also 75 percent less likely to develop multiple myeloma. Evidence for the health benefits of a vegetarian diet seem to be as prominent in the news as delicious new veggie options on grocery shelves. What was the case for eating meat, again? "
VEGAN FOOD FRAUD,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/vegan-food-fraud,"JUNE 30, 2009","There are fewer things more enjoyable than heading to a vegan restaurant, knowing you can order anything off the menu without worry. Or can you? Two anonymous bloggers have proven otherwise. With the help of Mr. Wishbone, an anonymous tipster, Quarrygirl and her partner Mr. Meaner set up a laboratory that met California Retail Food Code standards and ordered kits to test food for hen’s egg, casein (milk protein), and shellfish. They obtained samples from 17 LA vegan restaurants and immediately wrapped the food in plastic bags and placed the samples in a medical ice chest. Of the 17 restaurants tested, only 10 passed as completely vegan. The other seven restaurants’ samples showed traces of animal products, with vegan Thai food being the main culprit. The bloggers discovered that most vegan fish and meats used in these restaurants are actually packaged in Taiwan, which has just started on July 1 to enforce strict labeling laws for vegetarian foods. The next time you’re dining vegan in LA, beware. That egg-, milk-, and shellfish-free crispy soy chicken may really be full of it. "
NEW LAW REQUIRES COMPOSTING,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/new-law-requires-composting,"JUNE 30, 2009","The Board of Supervisors in San Francisco has been talkin’ trash—compost, that is. The Board passed new rules for recycling and composting, and future fines are planned for throwing out scraps, making it the toughest recycling law in the US. San Franciscans may want to think twice about putting food into their regular trash containers, as doing so may someday cost them a fine of $100. The rules designate a new green container for compost in addition to the familiar blue container for recyclables and black container for garbage. The fines for misplacing food scraps will be introduced in 2011, thus allowing residents ample time to familiarize themselves with the new system. It’s a good wakeup call for the rest of the nation to give leftovers the once-over before tossing them. "
BEEF RECALL EXPANDS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/beef-recall-expands,"JUNE 30, 2009","An expanded recall offers another great reason to forgo the beef and stick with veggies this July 4. E. coli may be thriving in a number of assorted beef products manufactured by JBS Swift Beef Co., based in Greeley, Colorado. The company has expanded its initial recall on June 22 to include about 380,000 pounds of potentially contaminated beef. This raises the recall total to about 421,000 pounds. The recall came after an investigation revealed that the meat may be linked to 18 illnesses. E. coli can be deadly and can cause kidney failure in extreme cases. Stick to faux meats so you can grill with ease and stay away from disease. "
THIS WEEK’S GIVEAWAY: VEGAN CARAMELS!,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/this-weeks-giveaway-vegan-caramels,"JUNE 30, 2009","With all this talk of caramel on VegNews.com and in the current edition of the magazine, we began craving these decadent, dairy-free candies.

CANCER-CAUSING ANIMAL FATS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/cancer-causing-animal-fats,"JUNE 29, 2009","Just in time for grilling season, a new study carried out by the National Cancer Institute discovered that people who consume animal fats have a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. In a six-year study of 500,000 people, participants kept a food diary that detailed their daily eats. Over the years, 1,337 participants developed pancreatic cancer. Of those people, participants who consumed high amounts of total, saturated, and monounsaturated fats—particularly from red meat and dairy—had 36 percent higher relative rates of pancreatic cancer compared to those who ate the least. Men with a high animal fat diet had a 53 percent higher relative rate of pancreatic cancer compared to those who consumed the least amounts, while women had a 23 percent higher rate than those who ate the least. Cut the fat and reach for a soy cheese-topped veggie burger at your next grill-out. "
COMPASSIONATE CREDIT CARD,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/compassionate-credit-card,"JUNE 29, 2009","In an economic climate when spending money can sometimes be painful, a new pairing will bring relief to many. Bank of America Credit Cards and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) have joined forces to bring shoppers and animal lovers an adorable HSUS credit card. Covered with a picture of a green-eyed, rust-colored cat, the Platinum Plus Visa card does more than pay for your groceries. For every $100 spent, Bank of America donates $.25 to HSUS. The next time you’re in a shopping mood or out to dine with friends, don’t be afraid to pull out the kitty-covered card and shop friendly. "
MENU-BOUND NUTRITION FACTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/menu-bound-nutrition-facts,"JUNE 29, 2009","Calorie counts for standard menu items will no longer be a mystery in California starting July 1. The numbers will now be front and center at 123 chains and more than 20 restaurants statewide in a bid to curb the ever-expanding waistlines in the Golden State. More than 17,000 restaurants have the option of either listing calories on menus and indoor menu boards or handing customers brochures that also detail saturated fat, salt, and carbohydrate content. Sounds like a great way to let costumers compare their standard fare to healthier veggie options and see exactly how it all adds up. "
FOUR-LEGGED FAMILY MEMBERS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/four-legged-family-members,"JUNE 28, 2009","We cuddle them, feed them, dress them, and more than anything, love them. We might as well set a place at the dinner table for them, seeing that an Associated Press-petside.com poll discovered that half of all American animal companion owners consider their four-legged friends just as much a part of the family as any other person. According to the poll, another 36 percent of people said their animal companions were part of the family but not full members. The poll also found that single women are the most likely to consider animals full-time family members. The next time the holiday family photo shoot rolls around, be sure not to forget Fido. "
MEDITERRANEAN MEALS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/mediterranean-meals,"JUNE 28, 2009","A new study on the Mediterranean diet provides more evidence for the case to go veg, especially for those who want to live to a ripe old age. Longevity has been linked to specific Mediterranean-diet aspects, such as consuming lots of vegetables and olive oils, eating meat sparingly, and drinking a moderate amount of alcohol. In the study, 23,349 participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition were followed for an average of 8.5 years, and their diets were rated in relation to how similar they were to a traditional Mediterranean diet. A moderate alcohol intake came in first as the most important aspect of the diet, with a low consumption of meat coming in second. So, respect all life, live more life … sounds like a win-win! "
KOSHER MEAT DEBATE,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/kosher-meat-debate,"JUNE 28, 2009","Last Wednesday, the European Parliament backed legalizing kosher meat in all European Union countries. The new law states that kosher meat may be sold and traded freely—a decision that animal rights groups oppose, declaring that the method of slaughter is inhumane. According to the laws of “shechita,” which dictates how animals should be slaughtered according to Jewish religious methods, the animals that are slaughtered cannot be pre-stunned. The Farm Animal Welfare Council claims that kosher and halal methods cause animals “significant pain and distress.” The ruling also comes with news welcomed by animal advocates: Slaughterhouses will have a specific person assigned to be responsible for animal welfare and to ensure that workers are properly trained. "
FAIR-TRADE FUTURE,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/fair-trade-future,"JUNE 28, 2009","Adopting a plant-based diet often signals a moral and ethical shift in a person. Through dietary choices, conscious consumerism, and dedicated activism, the veg community works to end exploitation and suffering. But are we missing something? Examine the secret life of two tasty foods considered commonplace in the average veg diet: bananas and chocolate. Begin with the banana. Who knew that the average smoothie could be so fraught with meaning? Bananas gained a steadfast place in the US largely through sheer American force. Central America—the decided territory to supply the US’ banana habit—was seen as a vast, open frontier by Boston Fruit Company (which was known soon thereafter as United Fruit Company and finally Chiquita) and Standard Fruit, which is known today as Dole. The conglomerates dominated the land, industry, and the government, all in the name of business. This is not all part of the distant past: in 2007, Chiquita was fined $25 million by the US government for giving $1.7 million to a right-wing death squad organization in Colombia. As for the workers, the average daily wages for an Ecuadorian plantation worker can be as low as $3, approximately 60 percent of the required minimum wage. Given this fact, what is a compassionate banana-lover to do? Buy fair trade. By most accounts, the organic label is not an assurance of the treatment of workers on farms; though it does mean that farm workers are not exposed to harmful chemicals, it does not mean they are paid a living wage, receive benefits, job security, or better treatment. The singular label that would cover that is the Fair Trade label, such as the one offered by TransFair USA, the only such certifier in this country. Buying your bananas fair trade is your best assurance that they were grown in a way that respects workers, farmers, and the environment. If money talks, the United States loves chocolate the most ardently, to the tune of more than $13 billion per year. What, other than the dairy that vegans avoid because of the exploitation of our bovine friends, is the problem with chocolate? Indentured child slavery and labor abuses on cacao farms, to be precise. West Africa is responsible for 70 percent of the world’s cocoa and poverty is rampant, exacerbated by the very low prices farm laborers are compensated by companies like M&M/Mars (the largest chocolate company in the world, earning more than $16 billion annually). Because of the extremely low wages—somewhere between $30 and $108 per year—and the lack of human-rights standards enforced, there exists a major exploitation problem of the most vulnerable in the region: the children. The International Labor Organization and the US Department of State report 284,000 children living in abusive child-labor conditions in West Africa. Ethical production standards are a must for truly enjoying that rich morsel of dairy-free chocolate. For those of us attempting to navigate the tricky world of conscious consumerism, the supermarket grocery aisle presents a complex quandary thanks to the unprecedented availability of food and other goods from far-flung regions that the global market offers. While 21st century information technology allows access to the backgrounds of these products, that doesn’t necessarily translate to a more simple shopping experience, nor does make it easier to stay aligned with our values. Perhaps what we will find is that even in our modern world of on-demand iced mochas and banana muffins, with a little bit of research and planning, we can make choices that move us all closer to the sort of world we want to inhabit.

ISRAEL ADOPTS MEAT-FREE MONDAYS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/israel-adopts-meat-free-mondays,"JUNE 26, 2009","First it was Ghent, then it was McCartney, and now it’s Israel. The push for one vegetarian day per week is spreading globally, now with Israel calling for meat-free Mondays. In hopes to cut down meat consumption’s environmental damage (as it accounts for 18 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions), Jana and Ilan Gur, co-owners of an Israeli food magazine, think this is a simple way for everyone to help. Stepping things up, Jana and Ilan Gur have asked restaurants to create special vegetarian dishes each Monday. They say every restaurant has been enthusiastic about the menu additions. Here’s to happy, friendly, and veg fine-dining! "
CHAIN DITCHES BATTERY-CAGE EGGS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/chain-ditches-battery-cage-eggs,"JUNE 25, 2009","Sometimes it seems as though big-name food chains aren’t mindful of how they get food on the plates or into the bags of consumers. But with one major restaurant, Red Robin, some animal issues are taking flight. Red Robin recently announced that it will no longer use battery-cage eggs. By 2010, the company will use exclusively cage-free eggs from within the US. The company is also taking a closer look at where it purchases pork, and claims to be working with suppliers to phase in gestation crate-free pork. According to Senior Vice President Susan Lintonsmith, the company has realized that customers are concerned about the origins of what is on their plates. Customers, keep questioning! "
SILVERSTONE’S SEXY STRATEGY,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/silverstones-sexy-strategy,"JUNE 25, 2009","They say a way to man’s heart is through his stomach. This week, however, PETA advertisements have been trying to win over men’s hearts through their television screens. In a recent issue of Men’s Fitness magazine, El Paso, Texas, was named one of the fattest cities. To help sway the carnivorous, meat-loving men and women from their harmful diets, PETA has selectively played Alicia Silverstone’s PSA TV ad campaign in the area. Dripping with chlorinated pool water, a nude Silverstone emerges from her swim session saying, “I’m Alicia Silverstone, and I’m a vegetarian.“ Perhaps a lean Silverstone really can convince others to cut the fat– and the meat. "
SHARKS FACE EXTINCTION,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/sharks-face-extinction,"JUNE 25, 2009","Many sharks are currently in the red, as their numbers are dwindling. Serious overfishing of sharks has put several species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species, meaning that they may soon face extinction. Over 30 percent of 64 species of sharks and rays listed are endangered, while an additional 24 percent are classified as Near Threatened. The group says that sharks are “profoundly vulnerable” when it comes to overfishing because they take years to mature and produce a small number of offspring. Finning may also be a culprit in the sharks’ decrease. A complete report will be out by the end of the year detailing the sharks’ demise. "

FISH LINKED TO MAD COW,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/fish-linked-to-mad-cow,"JUNE 24, 2009","What comes in pairs like forks and knives? Perhaps fish and mad cow disease, scientists have discovered. Robert P. Friedman, neurologist of University of Louisville, and his co-workers believe that fish that are fed cow byproducts, such as cow meat or bone meal, may be transmitters of mad cow disease. Though the doctors have not yet found whether it’s possible for a fish to transmit the disease to humans, they are urging government regulators to ban the feeding of cow byproducts to fish. Seeing as mad cow disease is untreatable and fatal, it’s best for all farmers to take caution. Stay safe by keeping your plate fish-free. "
HSUS DVD OFFERS HEALTH ADVICE,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/hsus-dvd-offers-health-advice,"JUNE 24, 2009","Need help sifting through and making sense of the most recent health and nutrition reports?

BALTIMORE DEBUTS ELECTRIC CAR,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/baltimore-debuts-electric-car,"JUNE 24, 2009","Move aside gas-guzzlers, there’s a greener way to get around in Baltimore. The city introduced the nation’s first electric car-sharing program, and it’s located at the Maryland Science Center. As of Wednesday, residents have the option to rent and cruise around town in the eco-friendly Maya 300, an electric car designed by Electrovaya. A five-door, four passenger vehicle with zero emissions, the Maya 300 can cover 120 miles on a single charge. Ten of these eco-friendly cars are currently available, and a two-hour rental costs $29. Costing only $1 in energy per 50 miles, you can rent and kiss emissions—and gas payments—goodbye. "
VEG DIET BOOSTS SPERM COUNT,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/veg-diet-boosts-sperm-count,"JUNE 23, 2009","What we eat can affect our skin, hair, mood, and overall health. Now, scientists have found that diet may even affect the strength of sperm. In a recent study, researchers found that men who consumed more fruits and vegetables, foods rich in antioxidants, saw better sperm quality. The antioxidants are believed to help lower the level of oxidative stress, which can negatively affect sperm quality, and help boost sperm concentration and mobility. This built on the earlier evidence led by Jaime Mendiola, lead author and researcher at the University of Mendiola, that unveiled that men who eat larger quantities of meat and full-fat dairy have lower sperm quality than more herbivorous males. So men, dig into those greens to boost your baby-making abilities. "
FOOD NOT BOMBS GETS THE BOOT,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/food-not-bombs-gets-the-boot,"JUNE 23, 2009","What’s the harm in sharing free, ethical vegan dishes? Plenty, according to Middletown, Connecticut, which aims to halt the potlucks of the city’s own chapter of Food Not Bombs. Middletown plans to enforce a cease and desist order for “dispensing” food, an act that must be regulated by the city’s health code. Middletown Food Not Bombs claims that it does not dispense the food like restaurants or soup kitchens do, but shares it in a community-style potluck. The group says it’s a statement of equality, a statement they’ve been making for the past 10 years. Food Not Bombs is seeking a federal injunction against the cease and desist order so they can continue their vegan potlucks and share meat-free meals with the masses. "
PLANT-BASED REMEDY,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/plant-based-remedy,"JUNE 23, 2009","Is a veggie diet the cure for what ails you? Katherine Lawrence thinks it could be. At the age of 27, she was diagnosed with severe endometriosis, uterine cysts, and ovarian cysts. Her doctor’s solution involved putting her into early menopause that would be followed by a hysterectomy, but Lawrence had other plans. She chose to clean up her diet and eat only low-fat vegan foods, and after five weeks, her health problems disappeared. She now teaches cooking classes aimed at promoting the benefits of low-fat vegan eating as part of the non-profit group The Cancer Project. And with recipes like Spicy Veggie Wraps and Guiltless Chocolate Mousse, Lawrence’s prevention plan certainly makes for one tasty remedy. "
OBAMA ON CLIMATE CHANGE,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/obama-on-climate-change,"JUNE 22, 2009","With the global average temperature having risen 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900, it’s clear that things are only getting hotter. Setting out to discover the effects of global climate change over the next century, the Obama administration released the study, Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, last week. The collaborating 13 agencies project what will happen to water supply and temperature changes regionally throughout the US. They foresee intense, heavy downpours, sea-level rises, and hurricanes that will greatly damage almost all forms of transportation. Also, they predict an increase in heat-related illnesses and deaths. The report closes with a reminder that our choices today affect the future. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, livestock is responsible for 18 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, the very gas that traps heat, which is more than the entire global transportation system. Perhaps with a little less meat-eating and a little more conscientiousness, we could cool things off. "
SCHOOL LUNCH IMPROVEMENTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/school-lunch-improvements,"JUNE 22, 2009","For students across the country, a cafeteria lunch no longer equates to cold burgers and mystery meat. Instead, the School Nutrition Association’s focus on healthy meals for kids has led to more and more vegetarian lunch options. According to the soon-to-be released 2009 School Nutrition Operations Report, nearly two-thirds of school nutrition programs offer vegetarian options, up from 22 percent in 2003. Even more progressive, the report found that 20.5 percent of programs offer vegan menu items. With lunches of luscious entrée salads and whole-grain crust veggie pizza, students can enjoy a healthy, well-rounded meal. Now that’s thinking outside the lunch box. "
NEW DOC FOLLOWS VEG TRANSITION,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/new-doc-follows-veg-transition,"JUNE 22, 2009","A man walks into a raw vegan café and is forever changed. The best part? It’s all captured on film. In the documentary May I Be Frank?, which is in its final stage of post-production, a 54-year-old meat-eating ex-drug addict with numerous health problems visits Café Gratitude in San Francisco and decides to go vegan for 42 days. His goal? To have a second chance at life in order to find love. The title suggests there is a Frank that should’ve been before all the addictions hijacked his life, and what better way is there to wipe the slate clean than to switch to a vegan diet? "
VAUTE COUTURE’S HOLIDAY LINE,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/vaute-coutures-holiday-line,"JUNE 21, 2009","On a mission to create the best vegan coats ever, eco- and veg-friendly fashion house Vaute Couture has launched its holiday line for this year.

ROOFTOP FARMING,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/rooftop-farming,"JUNE 21, 2009","When in a city, its skyline is often what’s most impressive. Recently, what’s more impressive is that topping those roofs is no longer just pavement. The green roof movement is pushing city slickers to remove the blacktop from their roofs and cover them in green. By growing vegetables, fruits, and other plants on rooftops, the movement aims to decrease storm runoff, create urban heat, and provide natural insulation. In a survey by Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, an organization representing companies that create green roofs, it was discovered that green roofs cover 6 million to 10 million square feet, a 35 percent growth since last year. Schools use green roofs to get kids involved, churches utilize their greenery to teach volunteers about growing and cooking their own food, and some green thumbs simply enjoy getting their hands dirty. Whatever the reason, green is definitely the new black. "
CHE’S GRANDKID CAMPAIGNS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/ches-grandkid-campaigns,"JUNE 19, 2009","PETA is starting its first-ever campaign in South America, and to star in the saucy ad is a woman with a revolutionary background. Lydia Guevara, granddaughter of Cuban revolutionary leader Ernesto “Che” Guevara, will be modeling for advertisements to be printed in the fall. Dressed in camouflage pants, a red beret, dog tags, and a bandolier with carrots in lieu of bullets, Guevara’s look represents the ads’ message: “Join the vegetarian revolution,” according to PETA spokesman Michael McGraw. While Che’s Marxism led to the rise of Fidel Castro and Che’s own eventual execution, Lydia’s activism will be saving the lives of animals and humans alike. "
CLEAN ENERGY CREATES JOBS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/clean-energy-creates-jobs,"JUNE 18, 2009","There may be a clean way to boost the economy and improve unemployment rates. According to recent studies by environmental groups and research institutes, the two latest clean energy provisions and acts seen before Congress can help generate $150 billion for clean energy, thus creating 1.7 million jobs. Specifically, the new provisions incorporated into the American Recovery and Investment Act (passed in February) combined with the American Clean Energy and Security Act (now before Congress) could help supply 870,000 of the 1.7 million jobs for low-income and less-educated citizens. Two reports, one made jointly by the Center for American Progress and the Political Economy Research Institute and another by Green for All and the Natural Resources Defense Council, posit that the increase in jobs and employment should raise earnings for low-income workers by two percent. Now wouldn’t that be a clean change? "
THE QUEEN GETS ORGANIC,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/the-queen-gets-organic,"JUNE 18, 2009","The latest installation into the Buckingham Palace’s garden is anything but an English rose. Queen Elizabeth recently has decided to add a plentiful vegetable patch to the vegetation, the first vegetables grown on the Palace’s lot since World War II. Full of beans, onions, leeks, beetroot, sweet corn, and carrots, this garden has been untouched by chemicals. The veggies are being watered from the palace borehole, or well, and the plants are being fed liquid seaweed to promote growth. There is speculation that the Queen has been influenced by Michelle Obama’s recent move to have an organic garden on-site at the White House. However she got the idea, way to be green, Queen! "
ENDING ARCHAIC ANIMAL TESTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/ending-archaic-animal-tests,"JUNE 18, 2009","University of Cardiff cell biologist Kelly BéruBé is a rat’s best friend. Her work, if ultimately successful, could eliminate rat testing by providing a superior alternative: a microlung. Instead of using about 200 rats to inhale a chemical to see whether it’s toxic—or using around 3,000 rats for chronic tests—the microlung could be used in their place. BéruBé creates the lung by growing cells on tiny plastic spheres that replicate the function of the cells inside human lungs. Already, two companies are testing drugs on the microlung, but for it to be fully operational, the microlung needs to be a 3-D organ instead of the 2-D structure it currently is. "
SEALS SPARED DURING HUNT,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/seals-spared-during-hunt,"JUNE 17, 2009","The 2009 seal hunt season is over, and about three-fourths of the animals slated to be bludgeoned were spared. More than 300,000 seals were scheduled for the hunt this year but only about 72,000 seal pups have been reported killed. The low number is being attributed to a decrease in the price of seal fur as demand drops and a European Union-wide ban on the import of seal products from commercial hunts—so far, 30 countries have banned seal products. The EU decided to ban seal products because of the cruelty involved in the hunt. With any luck, it’s a blow from which the seal trade won’t recover. "
UK’S CYCLING CAMPAIGN,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/uks-cycling-campaign,"JUNE 17, 2009","There couldn’t be a lovelier way to enjoy a sunny summer day than hop on a bike in lieu of riding a car. Seeing that it also helps your health and fitness, supermodel Elle Macpherson has joined forces with Britain’s latest cycling campaign, Skyride, as an ambassador. The campaign, put on by UK cycling company, Sky, and British Cycling, promotes cycling as a healthy way to travel and spend time with family. To get people pumping, Skyride is hosting 400 local rides in four city centers—Manchester, Glasgow, Leicester, and London—that will shut down several roads so that people can bicycle freely. Biking to promote family, fitness, and fun? Now that’s model behavior. "
BEEF CORRUPTION CASE,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/beef-corruption-case,"JUNE 17, 2009","Beef giant JBS, located in Brazil, is corrupt in more ways than one. The company is currently being investigated for allegedly adding water to its meat to increase weight and for bribing inspectors and public servants to OK the quality of its meats for consumption. The sting operation (dubbed “Operation Slaughter”) involves 250 police officers and has resulted in 22 arrests so far, with many people from the beef, dairy, and leather industries currently being held in police custody. Brazil’s cattle industry already has a bad reputation—environmentalists have long criticized the industry’s part in deforestation. Let’s just hope the investigation results in a few new vegetarians as well. "
VEGAN EARTH DAY,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/vegan-earth-day,"JUNE 16, 2009","It may not seem as though the terms “Ohio congressman” and “vegan” go together, but Dennis Kucinich is proving otherwise. Kucinich, representative for Ohio’s 10th congressional district, is in full support of honoring Vegan Earth Day on June 21. As told to Bob Linden of the radio program Go Vegan with Bob Linden, Kucinich’s Press Secretary Nathan White revealed that the congressman is currently creating a proclamation in support of Vegan Earth Day. Kucinich, a vegan himself, will deliver his statement from the floor of the United States Congress, which will be televised by C-SPAN. Speaking to the need for increased global awareness of the environmental, health, and economic benefits of a vegan lifestyle, the congressman is sure to capture audiences, both congressionally and globally.

ROCKIN’ ANIMAL-FREE FOOTWEAR,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/rockin-animal-free-footwear,"JUNE 16, 2009","With vegan footwear abound in shoe stores these days, there is a style out there for every taste. A new all-black trainer can be added to the options thanks to Green Day’s Mike Dirnt. In collaboration with Macbeth, the Green Day bassist has designed a leather-free shoe that has a canvas and synthetic patent upper, a rubber sole, and brass lace loops. The shoe’s high-top version (the Schubert) costs $79.99, while the low-top version (the Matthew) costs $64.99. The design is the latest in a variety of vegan shoes from Macbeth, and these cruelty-free kicks are definitely made for rockin’. "
FAUX MEATS NOT VEG,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/faux-meats-not-veg,"JUNE 15, 2009","As vegetarians, we often rely on prepackaged meal-makers, like veggie burgers and soy jerky, and find comfort knowing we are eating cruelty-free food. A recent investigation in Taipei, however, has proven that consumers shouldn’t be so trusting. Of 31 vegetarian food samples collected from vendors in Taipei City and County for safety checks, 17 samples contained meat. Perhaps more startling was the discovery of 20 percent beef or pork found in vegetarian patties, ham, and shredded pork from the two most serious cases. Taipei’s Investigation Bureau has vowed to refer vendors who knowingly added meat for prosecution on fraud charges. If you find yourself in Taipei anytime soon, use caution when selecting substitutes. "
SEXIEST VEGETARIANS ANNOUNCED,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/sexiest-vegetarians-announced,"JUNE 15, 2009","Who’s the sexiest vegetarian celebrity of them all? The results of PETA’s 2009 Sexiest Vegetarian Alive poll point to country singer Kellie Pickler and actor Milo Ventimiglia of Heroes fame. Ventimiglia is a lifelong vegetarian, while Pickler cut out meat after Googling “PETA” and watching the group’s online videos. The pair has stolen the title from last year’s champs, pop star Leona Lewis and Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis. Portia de Rossi topped the list for Australian celebrities in a similar poll hosted by one of PETA’s affiliates. Thanks to these celebs for being shining examples of the beauty of a plant-based diet.

The chain is venturing into the realm of wraps and flatbread sandwiches to satisfy consumer demand for healthier food options, and one new menu item is entirely vegan. Filled with red quinoa, hummus, and fresh field greens and served with mango vinaigrette on the side, the Greens and Grain Wrap is meat- and dairy-free and is already available in select locations across California. The wrap will be available at 222 California locations this month, and the rest of the nation will be able to enjoy this grab-and-go option over the next year. "
"SAYONNARA, FOIE GRAS",https://vegnews.com/2009/6/sayonnara-foie-gras,"JUNE 14, 2009","Costco often serves as the go-to place to stock up on large-scale grocery items. You can find family-size tubs of hummus, great deals on produce, and even quality cereal. What you’ll no longer find is foie gras, or fatty duck liver. Produced by fattening ducks and geese by shoving feeding tubes down their throats and over-filling them with food, foie gras has caused states and cities to want to remove the controversial meat product, with a complete ban going into effect in California in 2012. Costco’s food buyer Mike Dorpat said that because ducks’ necks are so small, he couldn’t ensure whether they were treated properly in the feeding process. Way to go, Costco! "
FIERCE FURLESS FASHION,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/fierce-furless-fashion,"JUNE 14, 2009","As fierce as fashion can be, with new designers constantly creating outfits over which fashionistas drool, one former fashion statement is decidedly “out.” The fur has got to go. In recognition of this, Parsons The New School of Design is teaming up with The Humane Society of the United States to better educate its students about the materials they use. HSUS representatives will inform Parsons’ fashion design and fashion marketing students on animal cruelty, advertising and labeling issues, and environmental impacts, all in relation to fur usage. Simon Collins, dean of fashion for Parsons The New School of Design, wants students to recognize the global impact of the apparel industry as well as the mistreatment of animals. "
FUR-FREE FIRST LADIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/fur-free-first-ladies,"JUNE 14, 2009","First ladies Michelle Obama and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy (hailing from France) are up in arms against wearing fur. In response to a query made by PETA, Bruni-Sarkozy wrote, “I do not wear, buy, or own fur.” The organization was concerned that a recent fashion choice was real, not faux. Obama’s deputy press secretary Semonti Mustaphi was equally to-the-point on the subject, confirming that Michelle “does not wear fur.” Here’s to knowing that US’ first lady will continue to choose bare arms over (bear) fur. "
MEAT MYTH UNDONE,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/meat-myth-undone,"JUNE 12, 2009","Think humans needed meat in their diets in order to evolve? Best-selling author Kathy Freston of the Huffington Post says it isn’t so, and that you needn’t look further than your own hands for proof: “[O]ur hands are perfect for grabbing and picking fruits and vegetables,” she writes. There’s more, and it has to do with agriculture, the length of our intestines, and basic physiology. Her conclusion is that just because we choose to eat meat doesn’t necessarily mean that we have the physiological make-up to be omnivores. Numerous diet-related health problems—heart disease, obesity, cancer—should be enough evidence for that. "

"FOOD, INC. PREMIERES",https://vegnews.com/2009/6/food-inc-premieres,"JUNE 11, 2009","Tonight, you could head to the movie theater for a lighthearted laugh, but instead, why not opt for a fascinating and educating film about something we all do: eat. Food Inc., produced and directed by Robert Kenner, lifts the veil that’s been hiding the truths of the USDA and FDA, the organizations responsible for how your food gets to your table. The documentary highlights how our nation’s food supply is controlled by only a handful of large corporations, which are solely driven by profit. Featuring industry experts like Eric Schlosser, author of Fast Food Nation, and Michael Pollan, author of In Defense of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto, the film explores issues like our country’s health, factory farming, genetic engineering, the environmental impact of transporting food, foodborne illnesses, and much more.

FRESH PRODUCE FOR ALL,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/fresh-produce-for-all,"JUNE 11, 2009","Convenience stores and gasoline stations are ubiquitous across America, but fresh, wholesome fruits and vegetables are often a rare find. The New York City Council has decided to change that, finding that low-income neighborhoods have the least access to healthy produce. The council has approved 1,000 mobile food carts in five boroughs where produce resources like markets and grocery shops have been absent for far too long. The Green Carts—the carts’ official title—are 200 strong right now, but will eventually spread and provide 1,000 jobs as well. Green Carts do not yet accept food stamps, and operators are required to stay in designated boroughs and sell only raw fruits and vegetables. Now this is a change we couldn’t be happier about. "
MODERN-DAY SLAVERY?,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/modern-day-slavery,"JUNE 10, 2009","In a recent op-ed, Jim Motavelli, senior writer at E/The Environmental Magazine and blogger for the Mother Nature Network, argues that meat-eating is the slavery of our time. Motavelli believes that we simply must become a vegetarian planet. The writer bases much of his argument on the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) 2006 report, “Livestock’s Long Shadow.” The FAO’s report reveals that livestock accounts for 18 percent of all greenhouse emissions, which is more than the entire global transportation system. Adding to that, 33 percent of fertile land is devoted to growing crops for animal feed while grazing leads to deforestation. Motavelli posits that we’ll be forced into vegetarianism by 2025 because “we simply won’t have the resources to keep up the [meat-eating] habit.” "
FIT FELINES AND CANINES,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/fit-felines-and-canines,"JUNE 10, 2009","As obsessed as humans are with fitness and weight, we are not the only ones who need to be concerned. Along with their overweight guardians, cats and dogs are also putting on extra pounds. Dr. Robert Kushner, an obesity expert and professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, says that dogs pick up the activity and eating habits of their human companions. Like Kushner, people have taken action to halt animal weight-gain by writing fitness guides for animals and humans, developing doggie gyms, and even “doga” (dog yoga). It’s easier to help dogs lose weight, as they are more willing to play fetch or go for a walk with humans, but cats tend to overeat and under-exercise. To help get cats involved in your workouts, celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson suggests tying a toy around dumbbells or using a flashlight while doing crunches to grab cats’ attention and get them moving. If desperation knocks, take cats in hand and use them as weights, as can be seen on the entertaining catworkout.com. "

You can eat to show support. With the power of daughter Stella and other family members behind him, McCartney is pushing for Meat-Free Mondays. As meat production is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions, the singer believes that one meat-free day per week is one way every person can make a meaningful change and help make the world cleaner and more sustainable. Joining McCartney in his quest for vegetarian Mondays are fellow famous faces such as Chris Martin, Kevin Spacey, Yoko Ono, and Woody Harrelson. One day a week sounds like a beautiful start! "
TAIWAN REVAMPS LABEL LAWS,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/taiwan-revamps-label-laws,"JUNE 9, 2009","Sometimes an ambiguous “for vegetarians” label can leave one questioning a food’s real content, Taiwan’s Department of Health has noticed. Starting July 1, ambiguity will be transformed into certainty with the newly required specific labeling. All packaged food in Taiwan must be labeled with one of five specific vegetarian categories, detailing all ingredients. Defined by the DOH, the five groups are “vegan,” “ovo-lacto vegetarian,” “ovo-vegetarian,” “lacto-vegetarian diet,” and “Wu Shin vegetarian diet,” which includes scallion, garlic, onion, leek, and hing, a spice traditionally used in Indian cooking. If products are found without proper labeling, companies can be fined anywhere from NT$30,000 ($913.58 US) to NT$150,000 ($4,567.91). "

COK TARGETS TEENS WITH NEW AD,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/cok-targets-teens-with-new-ad,"JUNE 8, 2009","MTV-watchers are normally seen as nonchalant teens who spend their days doing, well, whatever it is that teens do. It turns out that this demographic is also compassionate and takes notice. After more than a million views on MTV, Compassion Over Killing’s commercial, “A Side of Truth,” opened viewers’ eyes to the benefits of becoming vegetarian. A powerful commercial combined with an overwhelmingly positive response made for an inevitable award-winning formula. “A Side of Truth” has just been awarded a 2009 DoGooder TV Nonprofit Video Award. In the commercial, a young woman pulls up to a drive-through and orders fast-food fare. The drive-through worker responds with a slew of information about how pigs, chickens, and cows are mistreated in order to provide animal food products. It makes one think: what if we were served a side of truth with our meals? "
PUMP UP THE PROTEIN?,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/pump-up-the-protein,"JUNE 8, 2009","A recent study finds that pumping up the protein may help improve the health of your heart. The study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, tested whether among vegetarian diets, a high-protein, low-carbohydrate improves cholesterol levels. Of 47 overweight males and females with high total—and LDL— cholesterol levels, half the group was supplied with a high-protein, plant-based diet (eating foods like tofu and legumes) for one month, only consuming high-fiber oats and barley in small amounts. The other group was placed on a high-carb, low-fat, lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, which included low-fat or skim dairy, and egg whites or egg substitutes. At the end of the month, both groups had lost the same average weight, nine pounds, and both improved their cholesterol and triglyceride levels and blood pressure. The high-protein group, however, saw greater improvements. "

In an effort to stop the controversial horse-drawn carriages, a well-known NYC vegan boutique—that would be MooShoes, in case you’re wondering— and design agency, Raven and Crow Studio, are banding together. These two companies are combining forces with the Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages to create posters they hope city residents will post throughout town. One poster features vibrant prints of horses and reads, “Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages,” and another reads, “London Paris Toronto Beijing: Join the list of cities that give a damn, New York.” Their faded orange, vibrant violet, and fiery red are sure to capture attention.

VEGAN FOOD DRIVE,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/vegan-food-drive,"JUNE 3, 2009","Food drives are always a wonderful way to help the community. The Massachusetts-based Salem Vegan Society is stepping up by kicking off its fourth annual Salem Vegan Food Drive for 2009. The drive has grown annually, and this year the organization has turned tech-savvy, as people can now donate via Facebook’s Network For Good application. With an updated logo and new corporate sponsors, the group advocates being compassionate to both the homeless of Salem as well as to all living beings, so a vegan food drive seemed only natural. The Salem Vegan Society will be collecting wholesome vegan food until the end of June. "
NEW VEGAN LOGO,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/new-vegan-logo,"JUNE 2, 2009","Labels can be misleading. That’s why Plamil, a UK-based producer of vegan chocolates and mayonnaise, removed the Vegan Society’s trademark symbol and replaced it with a modernized version. The Vegan Society, a non-profit organization in England that provides a logo to companies they certify, allows for products to be labeled as vegan with an accompanying statement that says: ‘may contain milk/eggs/fish’ for companies who may not be able to ensure their products are animal-free (mostly due to processing on shared equipment). Plamil prides itself on its “free-from” standards, manufacturing products that are dairy-free, gluten-free, non-GMO, and made in a nut-free factory. It hopes its updated label will assure customers that its products are made to the highest vegan standards. "
SOY-FOODS SALES,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/soy-foods-sales,"JUNE 2, 2009","While the overall economy saw a downturn in 2008, the soy-foods product industry grew.

Seeing the most growth were large retailers, like Wal-Mart, where soy-rich sales increased by three percent, thus surpassing the sales of conventional retailers and natural supermarkets, where growth averaged about 1.4 percent. Authors of the report say that increased consumer knowledge about soy’s health benefits and soy’s increased availability are to thank for the sales boost. Customers filled their carts in 2008 most with soymilk, meat alternatives, tofu, and snack bars. "

Sliding into second place is San Francisco Giants’ AT&T Park followed by Colorado Rockies’ Coors Field. "
INTERVIEW WITH PETA’S BRUCE FRIEDRICH,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/interview-with-petas-bruce-friedrich,"JUNE 1, 2009","Bruce Friedrich’s efforts have supported prisoners, the hungry and homeless, peace advocates, and, of course, animals of all kinds. Though not yet 40, Bruce Friedrich has already lived an accomplished life. His Catholic Worker values were awakened when he was barely a teen, and there appears to be no progressive cause that he hasn’t been involved with. Friedrich believes that how one lives says far more than what one says, and his actions prove he walks his talk. VegNews: You live in Washington, DC. How has the Capitol changed since Obama’s inauguration?
Bruce Friedrich: There is a new energy—it’s really quite something. I bicycle commute about 15 miles per day, and I pass a lot of other cyclists and joggers every day. Where people used to pass with at best a nod, now people seem to genuinely acknowledge one another—everywhere I go, people just seem friendlier, like we’ve come out of a cave after a war has ended and we’re emerging into the bright light of peace. There is, despite the tough economic times, a real sense of optimism that is palpable everywhere my wife and I go. VN: You have just written, along with Matt Ball of Vegan Outreach, The Animal Activists’ Handbook. How did you and Matt team up to write this book, and what are your hopes for it?
BF: Matt and I have been discussing animal-rights strategy for more than a decade, and his ideas have had a profound impact on mine. For years, we at PETA have been holding these small regional conferences, and the most popular element of the conferences—by far—are the “effective advocacy” and “effective conversations” presentations. It occurred to me that it would be worth having a reference book that builds on PETA’s grassroots campaigns experience, Matt’s and my experience and discussions, and all we’ve learned from the tens of thousands of grassroots activists who volunteer for PETA and Vegan Outreach. I asked Matt to collaborate with me on the book, and he agreed, and PETA President Ingrid Newkirk very graciously agreed to write the introduction. Our hope is that the book will gain wide readership among animal advocates, that other advocates can learn from our mistakes and be more effective at advocating on behalf of animals, and that we’ll hear from people about how to improve the book—new tips that we missed—for the next printing. VN: As PETA’s Vice President for Policy & Government Affairs, what’s your average day like?
BF: Every day varies wildly. I just returned from Vancouver, where we had a successful press conference to announce our plans to use the 2010 Winter Olympics in Canada to focus attention on the horror of the annual Canadian seal massacre. Much as human-rights activists used the Beijing Olympics to focus attention on China’s human-rights failings, we will work with activists globally to finally put an end to the mass killing of more than 200,000 animals every year. Anyone interested in participating in that campaign should give me a ring. PETA is opening a DC office soon, and we hope to really shape the culture of this city. VN: Way back in August 2001, you and your bare bum appeared on the cover of VegNews. Please explain.
BF: Right! George Bush was due to arrive at Buckingham Palace for lunch with the Queen, and there were huge anti-Bush protests. I happened to be in London at the time, and we needed something that would get noticed among the thousands of anti-Bush protesters, so I got naked and charged the motorcade with “goveg.com” on my chest and back. It worked! We received massive traffic to the site. Mission accomplished. "
MILLS VEG EMPIRE,https://vegnews.com/2009/6/mills-veg-empire,"JUNE 1, 2009","With hopes of appealing to vegetarians and meat eaters alike, Heather Mills, a former model and wife of Sir Paul McCartney, is opening a vegan restaurant, V-Bites, in England this July. Mills, 41, signed a deal with Big Fish Café on March 13 to makeover the restaurant into a fun, healthy, and plant-based eatery. She has been working on a menu with items that will draw in all types of customers, saying, “what is definitely going to shock people is the meat replacements.” “They have a real meat taste to them,” she says. Whether vegetarians will enjoy the “real meat taste” will be seen upon the eatery’s opening, but kudos to Mills and her team for creating this soon-to-be veg destination. "
CREATURES WITH CONSCIENCE,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/creatures-with-conscience,"MAY 31, 2009","Cooking doesn’t cut it. Tools have been outruled. So, what exactly is it that separates humans from animals? Well, it certainly isn’t the ability to feel complex emotions or tell right from wrong. Professor Marc Berkoff from the University of Colorado at Boulder considers animals ranging from mice and rats to dolphins to chimpanzees in his new book, Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals. Using examples such as the spindle cells in their brains that cause dolphins to feel empathy for other species, Berkoff argues that morals are hard-wired into the brains of all mammals, providing further proof that humans and animals are not so different after all.

"LESS SLEEP, MORE MOOD SWINGS",https://vegnews.com/2009/5/less-sleep-more-mood-swings,"MAY 31, 2009","The battle between night owls and early birds rages on. While people who prefer to stay up late may be more focused later in the day, recent evidence suggests they may also be more negative. In a study published in Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, scientists discovered that night owls were almost three times more likely than early risers and five times more likely than intermediate snoozers to suffer severe symptoms of depression. Even slight variations in sleep patterns appeared to drastically affect mood. While it seems plausible that shifting your sleep schedule may improve your mood, scientists have already discovered a gene responsible for causing some people to rise early and others to sleep late, regardless of what time the alarm goes off!

INTERVIEW WITH WORLDWIDE VEGAN BAKE SALE ORGANIZER GARY LOEWENTHAL,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/interview-with-worldwide-vegan-bake-sale-organizer-gary-loewenthal,"MAY 31, 2009","Advocacy doesn’t always mean taking to the streets armed with leaflets and picket signs. Sometimes the whisk is mightier than the sword, and it’s that type of thinking that got the folks at Compassion for Animals sweet on the idea of doing a Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale (WVBS) June 20-28, 2009. VegNews catches up with organizer Gary Loewenthal to discuss how to serve your cookies with a side of compassion. VegNews: Where did the idea for WVBS come from?
Gary Loewenthal: Last fall, when Compassion for Animals was getting started, the three other co-founders and I were talking about what kinds of outreach we wanted to do, besides the usual. Someone suggested bake sales. I loved the idea. We could leverage this widely accepted, traditional, and fun activity to introduce the public to veganism and melt away some misconceptions about vegan food. VN: How many people and countries will be participating in the bake sale this year?
GL: My goal was to have 30 bake sales this year. We’re on track so far; in fact, it’s looking like we’ll do better than that. So far, we have participants from Australia, New Zealand, Nigeria, the UK, Canada, and the US. If there are any translators reading this, we’d love to have some materials in French and Spanish to help us better reach out to countries in which those languages are spoken! VN: What is your ultimate goal for putting on this event?
GL: The WBVS has five main goals:
1. Promote vegan baked-goods, and veganism in general, in a friendly, upbeat, and engaging way
2. Encourage non-animal-related and/or non-vegan groups to try their hand at vegan baking, which, perhaps, will lead to further inquiries about veganism
3. Provide an outreach outlet for vegans who may not be interested in other forms of activism such as leafleting and protests
4. Present an opportunity for participants to experience the camaraderie resulting from others doing similar activities during the same short time period
5. Provide a vehicle by which groups or individuals can combine vegan outreach with helping a cause of their choosing VN: Participants can also do a giveaway sponsored by VegFund. How does that work?
GL: VegFund has offered to consider funding baked-good feed-ins or other no-charge events that are done in conjunction with the WVBS. People interested in this option would give away rather than sell their vegan baked-goods, and, once their plans are in place, apply for funding by going to the VegFund website and follow the instructions there. VN: How can potential participants get involved?
GL: The short answer is to secure a venue for the bake sale—the rest is relatively easy. The longer answer is find and reserve a location for your bake sale. Set a date. Let us know. Get volunteers for baking, tabling, and promoting. Decide where the proceeds will go. Take pictures. Let us know how you did. Have fun. Change the world. VN: What’s your favorite vegan baked good?
GL: That’s a tough one because I like them all. But I would have to say chocolate-chip cookies—which may partially explain the WVBS logo. "
WHY SAVING DRINKING WATER IS IMPORTANT (AND HOW TO HELP),https://vegnews.com/2009/5/why-saving-drinking-water-is-important-and-how-to-help,"MAY 31, 2009","From space, Earth looks like a cool, thirst-quenching ball of liquid. But less than three percent of the world’s water is fresh, and only about one-third of that is potable, since much of it is inaccessible in aquifers and icebergs. The one percent of the planet’s water that is safe to swallow is unevenly distributed, with some countries awash in freshwater lakes and underground sources and other populations left high and dry. For example, Brazil, the world’s wettest nation, has an average annual renewable freshwater supply of 8,233 cubic kilometers per year (roughly twice the amount of H2O annually consumed worldwide), while Rwanda only has about five. Such disparity has international water experts and leaders debating the fairest and most efficient way to deliver a scarce supply. Is water a natural resource and free to all, like air? Or is it a commodity, like oil, for which people should pay? Of course, people are already paying for their liquid’s pedigree. Annually, it’s a $50 billion worldwide industry that has become the new SUV, but bottled water is more than just a symbol of waste to many social activists. It represents a host of other problems, including unsustainable and expensive water delivery. “In this state and across the globe, water corporations are transforming a public resource into a high-priced luxury,” says Deborah Lapidus, national organizer with the Think Outside the Bottle campaign in Boston, Mass. “And to add salt to the wound, corporations like Coke are disparaging public tap water, bottling it, and then selling it back to us for more than the price of gasoline.” (An average 20-ounce bottle of water costs about $1.39—that’s nearly $9 per gallon.) The Think Outside the Bottle campaign works to reduce the negative effects of bottled water and stimulate support for public water systems. The campaign is led by Corporate Accountability International, which in 2007 successfully pressured Pepsi-Cola into revealing the source of its Aquafina water. Turns out the second-best-selling bottled-water brand in the US is purified tap water. Same for Coca-Cola’s Dasani, the number-one brand. Whether it’s purified, mineral, or spring water inside, the bottle itself usually ends up as litter or in a landfill. US consumers discard an estimated 60 million water bottles a day, most of which are not recycled. Fortunately, there is some indication the reduce-reuse-recycle message may be getting through. For the first time in a decade, sales of bottled water slowed in 2008, growing just 6.7 percent, versus 6.9 in 2007, according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation, a US trade group. Not much, but it’s a start. Perhaps the most disturbing issue, however, is pollution caused from raising animals for food. Much of the 500 million tons of waste generated by billions of chickens, pigs, cows, and other animals confined in US factory farms every year is stored in huge manure “lagoons.” These holding pools can leak or spill and pipelines can rupture, tainting surface and ground water. Just last year, a lagoon pipe at a Maryland dairy burst, spewing 560,000 gallons of liquid manure—nearly enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool—into a nearby creek and contaminating the town’s water supply with E. coli. The good news is being water-wise doesn’t mean resorting to a monthly bath. Lifestyle changes such as eating a plant-based diet, installing low-flow shower heads, opting for public tap water over bottled water, and simply being mindful about water use all help make the most of the planet’s limited supply.

21ST CENTURY DETOX,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/21st-century-detox,"MAY 31, 2009","Ideally, all we’d ever have to do is focus on eating healthy, exercising our bodies and minds, and thinking happy, healthy thoughts. With summer right around the corner, now’s a great time to lighten up, break some bad habits, and kick-start a new routine, but incorporating change can seem overwhelming when there are little things called “work,” “family,” and “needing to do 800 things in the next five minutes thank you very much” in our lives. Enter the online cleanse. In the new world of digital everything, the spa comes right to your screen with tips, recipes, and support. VN talked with healthy-living guru Moira Nordholt about an online 21-day cleanse that she’ll be supervising. VegNews: Is it important for everyone to do a cleanse?
Moira Nordholt: Yes. No matter how healthy we think we are, we can always go a step further toward impeccable health. We’re living in a toxic world. Almost everything we inhale, ingest, and absorb contaminates our body. But the awesome thing about our body is that it’s self-healing. When given an opportunity, it will perform miracles. VN: What kinds of foods should one eliminate when on a cleanse?
MN: All fast food, fried food, processed food, packaged food, most restaurant food, meat, wheat, dairy, coffee, sugar, white flour, white table salt, any refined sugars—like corn syrup—alcohol, tobacco and recreational drugs, anything that irritates or inflames, of course, anything that’s been proven to be an allergen to you, soda pop, hydrogenated and saturated fats, empty calories like chips and crackers, anything with more that one or two ingredients listed on the can, ans basically anything refined beyond recognition as a whole seed, nut, grain, or plant. VN: What foods will you feature throughout the cleanse?
MN: I’ll be featuring super, simple, seasonal, and sustainable foods throughout the 21 days. “Super” are foods recognized to have awesome healing benefits to the body, like garlic, ginger, pumpkin seeds, tomatoes, walnuts, spinach, kale, hemp, shiitakes, sea vegetables, and miso. “Simple” are everyday fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds you can find in their whole form at your local farmers’ market or health food store. “Seasonal” is what’s available in North America right now. “Sustainable” means realistic, down-to-earth preparation that won’t overwhelm or have you spending all day in the kitchen. VN: How do participants balance their cleanse with their real lives?
MN: This cleanse is designed for people at home who can’t make it to a spa for an intensive cleanse. The way I integrate it into my life is to let everyone around me know I’m doing it (that in itself often inspires others to do it along with me and now I have a support group of friends). I prepare mentally in advance by clearing off my calendar as much as possible and literally booking time for myself as if it’s the highest priority. I refrain from eating in restaurants as much as possible, but of course it’s almost impossible to go three weeks without having to meet someone for lunch or coffee, so I just choose the healthiest restaurant in town. And I don’t beat myself up if I screw up a day. VN: How have you benefitted from regular cleanses?
MN: Cleansing has become an essential part of my healthy lifestyle. Four times a year, I look forward to preparing food from scratch, spending more time in the kitchen, eating very consciously, pampering myself as if I’m at a really nice detox center. It’s done wonders for me and I’m convinced that when practiced regularly, cleansing can stabilize weight, bring emotions into balance, strengthen your organs, energize your spirit, and jump start your life into new areas you may have once found too challenging.

CLIMATE-BASED CASUALTIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/climate-based-casualties,"MAY 29, 2009","In recent years, rising sea levels, desertification, and changing rainfall patterns have emerged as symptoms of the overall climate change that Earth is experiencing. Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, speaking on behalf of The Global Humanitarian Forum, released the think-tank’s recent discovery that climate change causes 300,000 deaths a year, primarily in developing countries. In fact, the study showed that 99 percent of the effects were hitting developing countries the hardest, despite the fact that they’re collectively responsible for less than one percent of the world’s carbon changing emissions. The silver lining? Annan’s think-tank hopes this data will support a global treaty, designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions, that’s up for consideration in Copenhagen this December. "
PUPPY MILL MAYHEM,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/puppy-mill-mayhem,"MAY 27, 2009","More than 400 dogs were rescued on Wednesday from horrifying conditions at a Washington-based puppy mill. Benton County Sheriff, Larry Taylor, led the raid at Sun Valley kennel, which breeds miniature American Eskimo dogs on its 2-acre property. The mill is owned by 66-year-old Ella Stewart, who has pled not guilty to charges of second-degree animal cruelty. Officials and animal-rights groups involved in the efforts referred to the situation as “one of the worst cases” of animal abuse they had ever witnessed. The malnourished and neglected canines were found in makeshift kennels coated with feces and urine. All of the dogs will receive much-needed medical care at emergency kennels set up at the local fairgrounds. "
DHA DEFICIENT?,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/dha-deficient,"MAY 26, 2009","Think you’ve got your fatty acid situation under control? Even if flax seeds and walnuts are staples of your diet, there’s a good chance you may not be getting enough long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. A study of Austrian vegetarians and vegans found that both groups were at a greater risk of EPA and DHA deficiency, which leads to increased cases of dementia, depression, inflammatory diseases, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and allergies. Want to make sure you’re getting enough? Have a blood test done to determine your body’s level. Though fish and fish oil are often cited as prime sources, you don’t have to compromise your morals to keep your body healthy. Algae-derived DHA is not only safe for vegans and vegetarians, but some nutritionists believe it’s better, considering there’s no risk of mercury contamination. "

There is, however, one Golden-Arched giant from the fast-food block that has yet to make such concessions. McDonald’s—with the help of Michigan State University, University of California Davis, and the United States Department of Agriculture, among others—is currently investigating housing alternatives for hens. Humane living quarters are the ultimate goal, but some critics wonder whether this is just a stalling tactic, since the study will take two years to complete.

If so, you’re most likely taking in excess sodium, fat, and calories, suggests the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI). If you’ve made every attempt to maintain your “ignorance is bliss” mindset, your efforts might be hindered by the Menu Education And Labeling (MEAL) Act, introduced by Senator Tom Harkin and Representative Rosa DeLauro. The legislation would require that any eatery with more than 20 locations inform patrons of menu items’ calories, sodium, saturated and trans fats, and carbohydrate content. But, with some restaurants dishing out plates containing more than the average person’s daily calorie allotment, it doesn’t sound like such a bad idea! "
BISPHENOL BAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/bisphenol-ban,"MAY 17, 2009","Following in the footsteps of Minnesota and Suffolk County, NY, Chicago became the first city to ban the sale of Bisphenol A (BPA)-ridden baby bottles and sippy cups. Although its own regulatory agency (the FDA) still supports its safety, Capital Hill is currently considering a similar ban, in light of hundreds of independent studies attributing hormonal and developmental disruptions to BPA ingestion. Many manufacturers have already eliminated BPA from children’s products, including Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, and Nalgene. But kids aren’t the only ones at risk; A recent Harvard study found that one week of adult BPA bottle use increased urinary chemical concentrations by 69%! If you don’t happen to live in Chicago, you can still limit your exposure by avoiding canned food and plastic containers. "
CONSTRUCTIVE DAYDREAMING,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/constructive-daydreaming,"MAY 17, 2009","Next time your boss finds you daydreaming the day away, you can rest assure him or her that you were actively engaged in a mindful problem-solving technique—because you were. A recent study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that daydreaming allows us to enter an important and unique cognitive state in which we can focus on important issues in our lives, rather than the task at hand. Which is a good thing, considering previous studies have shown that we sometimes spend as much as one third of our waking lives in said state! "
CELEBS’ ORGANIC GARDENS,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/celebs-organic-gardens,"MAY 16, 2009","From DC to LA, organic gardens are cropping up everywhere! Most recently, Nicole Richie was caught with shovel in hand at Helen Bernstein High School in Hollywood. Along with Rosario Dawson, Amy Smart, and Lance Bass, Richie offered her green thumb to the Environmental Media Association’s Young Hollywood Board. As part of the program, each celebrity will adopt a particular school within the Los Angeles Unified District, where they’ll be responsible for planting and maintaining their organic garden. Here’s hoping their plants and plots will help clear some of the most polluted air on the planet! "
"EATING VEGAN AT 40,000 FEET",https://vegnews.com/2009/5/eating-vegan-at-40000-feet,"MAY 16, 2009","My 14-hour flight from DC to Tokyo provides me plenty of time to compare pre-ordered vegan meals to standard tray table fare. First I create teams: On one side sit the carnivores, which I affectionately call Carnies. On the other Veginistas. Viva la rutabaga! Our first entrées are hand-delivered, much to the anguish of the guy sitting in 32G. Couscous quivers next to a simple salad, a chocolate-chip cookie, and Rubschlager—slices of rye so dry they would make the Sahara cry. My wife receives a bland orzo-bean medley in a mystery sauce, salad, and a frail lemon cookie. As I wash down the sweaty-sock infused couscous with Japanese beer, the flight attendant quizzes the Carnies with chicken or beef. Both come with a salad, moist brownie, and a roll with margarine. Carnies 1, Veginistas 0. Anxiously, we wait for lunch. Like VIPs, we’re served first again; I feel a pair of eyes burn into my sideburns, so I turn and cast an unreciprocated smile to 32G. My snack contains white rice with pineapples, green peas, and raisins along with more dry bread. My wife is served a Mexican salad and pita bread (dry, of course). Both snacks are fresh and relatively tasty. Fifteen minutes later the Carnies are given plastic cups of high-sodium Ramen Noodles! To add insult to injury, they wait 10 minutes for boiling water. Carnies 1, Veginistas 1. It all comes down to the last supper. My tray holds soggy-but-savory roasted potatoes, fruit, and a cinnamon doughnut. My wife gets barley with spinach, carrots, and mushrooms; fruit and a sweet, dry bread roll we interpret as dessert. Not a slam-dunk. I nervously cast a glance over to 32G. Ten minutes later he receives his choice of chicken with rice or beef lasagna, both of which look uninspired. Carnies 1, Veginistas 2. Victory! Or is it? On a long flight, airline food is seldom a perfect choice. However, vegetarian meals do tend to be lighter, healthier, and easier to swallow—as long as you remember to sneak some margarine on board for all that dry bread! Airline Fare
The indistinguishable, mystery blob trying to pass for vegan lasagne on that long-haul flight to Buenos Aires doesn’t encourage sky-high dining. But, as vegetarianism continues on its trendy path, several airlines are debunking the stigma of meat-free airplane fare. Here’s what veg looks like at 30,000 feet: Aeroflot: Pasta with sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and chickpeas, mixed salad bowl, fresh fruit cup, small cake, and baguette. American Airlines: Tofu sautéed with onions and peppers over rice, green salad, roll, and vegan dessert. Air China: Sautéed vegetables with white rice, roll, side salad with baby corn and tomato, and dessert. Continental Airlines: Samosas with saffron rice, roll, green salad, and apple cake. Czech Airlines: Baked potatoes, steamed carrots and peas, whole-grain bun, fruit, and a side of fresh veggies. Hawaiian Airlines: Vegetarian meatloaf with green salad and a roll. United Airlines: Fried potatoes with peppers and onion, fruit salad, and a vegan cinnamon doughnut. "
MARINE LIFE IN JEOPARDY,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/marine-life-in-jeopardy,"MAY 16, 2009","Next time you plan a diving trip in Southeast Asia, there might not be much left to see. The Coral Triangle, an area that occupies about as much space as the US and spans Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines, is being destroyed at a rate of one to two percent a year. The culprits? Pollution, overfishing, and climate change. According to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund , the Coral Triangle may be gone by the end of the century, signifying the extinction of the more than 3,000 species of coral-reef fish, not to mention the destruction it would unleash on nearby countries. The WWF report outlines the worst and best-case scenarios, and advocates focusing on sustainable communities and immediate action to preserve this unequaled marine environment. "
VEGGIE PRIDE PARADE,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/veggie-pride-parade,"MAY 15, 2009","You won’t want to miss this one! At 11am tomorrow morning, New York’s finest vegetarians—environmentalists, animal-rights advocates, health nuts, spiritualists, and raw enthusiasts alike—will march through the Big Apple. Starting in Manhattan’s Olde Meat District, the parade will meander its way to Union Square Park. During last year’s debut, Penelo Pea Pod and PETA’s Chris P. Carrot were married in an open wedding ceremony; this year the couple will serve as grand marshals as we witness the naming ceremony of baby fruits and vegetables! So, be sure to show up or tune in to share your personal veggie pride! "
MAJOR BRANDS PUSH “LOCAL”,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/major-brands-push-local,"MAY 15, 2009","It’s hard to think of something as heavily manufactured as a bag of potato chips as a local product, but that’s exactly how Lay’s is now marketing their wares. In a new series of commercials that laud the importance of eating locally, Lay’s features five different “local” farmers—each farmer’s ad will only air in his or her home state. Other large food producers are also stepping up their game, having realized that there’s an increasing demand among consumers to know where their food is coming from. We’re happy to see more people taking an interest in what they’re eating, but we’re still pretty sure the farmers’ market is the best place to pick up tonight’s dinner. "
GHENT GOES GREEN,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/ghent-goes-green,"MAY 14, 2009","We don’t know about you, but here at the VNHQ, we’ve been imagining, dreaming of, and drooling over a hypothetical vegetarian world for quite some time. Thanks to the Belgian city of Ghent, we’re one step closer! Inspired by global warming and rising obesity rates, Ghent has officially declared a weekly “veggie day.” To help its citizens out, the city will print around 90,000 so-called “veggie street maps” complete with every vegetarian eatery available. While it’s just one small city in one little country, with livestock contributing one-fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions, every person can make a difference—including you! "
TWITTER AND SCHOOL LUNCH REFORM,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/twitter-and-school-lunch-reform,"MAY 14, 2009","His preferred method of communication may involve short, virtual posts in the blogosphere, but Twitter co-founder Biz Stone does not oppose sitting down and writing a good, old-fashioned letter—if it’s for a good cause. In response to the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act, Stone was moved to send an actual piece of written correspondence to Representative George Miller, showing his support for the bill and underlining the importance of providing vegetarian options for schoolchildren. In an unusual twist of events, Rep. Miller replied to Biz Stone via Twitter. Hey, as long as there are more veg options for school kids, we don’t mind how the word gets out there! "
MAINE BANS CRUEL CRATES,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/maine-bans-cruel-crates,"MAY 13, 2009","Hot on the heels of the legislation under consideration in New York, Maine can now count itself as a place where farm animals’ lives will be improving. Governor John Baldacci signed legislation that will prohibit gestation crates and veal crates, two types of individual cages that severely restrict pigs’ and veal calves’ movement. The Humane Society of the United States strongly supported this legislation and expressed gratitude to Senator John Nutting for playing an instrumental role in its success. Consumer demand is also driving companies like Burger King and Safeway to offer crate-free and cage-free options, which means that farms across the country are becoming just a little more livable. "
EXERCISE’S MIXED MESSAGES,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/exercises-mixed-messages,"MAY 13, 2009","Physical activity has long been touted as a disease-fighting force against everything from osteoporosis, chronic pain, and cancer to macular degeneration, heart disease, and dementia. But an anomaly study conducted by the World Health Organization suggests that one widespread epidemic may not be related to activity level: obesity. In fact, researchers found that changes in physical activity appeared to have no effect on weight, and encouraging exercise did not increase obesity risk among subjects. A supporting study in Obesity found that people who viewed posters with positive exercise messages actually ate more than those shown neutral ads. And if you are an avid exercise, you may want to reconsider your one-a-day, since consuming vitamins C and E has been shown to curb its metabolic benefits. But don’t give up your gym membership just yet; for now, the pros certainly outweigh the couple o’ cons! "

These melt-in-your mouth treats are perfect for roasting over a fire, floating in a rich cup of hot chocolate, or, dare we say, chopped into homemade rocky road ice cream. We loved them so much that we’re also featuring them as This Week’s Must-Have! Simply tell us what food comes to mind when you think of summer, and we’ll randomly choose one winner to receive a box of the delicious marshmallows. Good luck! "
GERMANY’S CAR-FREE CITY,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/germanys-car-free-city,"MAY 12, 2009","Residents of Vauban, Germany, lead lives that are pretty similar to suburbanites everywhere. They go to work, drop their kids off at their friends’ houses, and do the weekly grocery shopping. There is, however, one major difference—they do all this without motor vehicles, since Vauban is a car-free community. Car ownership is not prohibited, just slightly inconvenient since driveways, street parking, and garages are not allowed. This means that the majority of the city’s residents get around via the tram, bicycles, and their own two feet. While the idea of a suburb without cars may seem like an oxymoron to most Americans, plans for a similar development are already under consideration in Hayward, California’s Quarry Village. We can’t wait to see more American cities say auf wiedersehen to automobiles! "
CONTROL YOUR CRAVINGS,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/control-your-cravings,"MAY 12, 2009","When it comes to food, do you find it challenging to choose health over flavor? If so, you may want to enlist your dorsolateral prefrontal cortex next time you open the fridge. This small clump of cells buried deep within the brain seems to be responsible for willpower, according to a Science study conducted at Caltech by neuroscientist Todd Hare. Scientists found that dieters who were able to exercise self-control used this portion of the brain, which is also linked to working memory and meeting goals. Having trouble with all three? Good news: The research team is already developing brain-training exercises to help people improve self-control, which may offer alternative treatment for over-eaters, drug addicts, and smokers alike.

LIVING LARGE FOR LESS,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/living-large-for-less,"MAY 12, 2009","Downturn, shmownturn. Just because the economy’s been circling the drain for a while now doesn’t mean we need to forego the good parts of life. While pinching pennies is never a bad idea, knowing when to let them go can be about a thousand times more fun, especially when you know exactly how to make the most of each one. Most of us probably aren’t planning any around-the-world trips right this second, but that’s no reason to think that all good times must cease until we’re magically millionaires. (OK, so maybe we weren’t all millionaires at the best of economic times, either.) Great meals, easy entertaining, and maybe just one or two splurges here and there make for a life that’s rich in experience, if not in moola. We’ve pulled together three plans, each for a varying level of income. Whether you’ve always been of the thrifty persuasion (aka been a broke college student), or you’ve been forced to downsize from your $20 million mansion to one that’s worth a mere $5 million since Madoff made off with your money, we’ve got a rundown on the best buys for vegetarians—from food to fashion. The Young & Hungry Idealist
Disposable income: $300/year
What’s in your shopping cart?: Free samples from the farmers’ market, thrift-store t-shirts
Inner circle: Colleagues from campus AR and Green Party groups, local co-op clerks
Fave dining spot: College cafeteria and grassy knoll at the park
Last vacation: What vacation?
Must-have groceries: Bananas, broccoli, dry beans, garlic, green onions, miso, multigrain bread, peanut butter, red bell peppers, rice, romaine lettuce, spinach, tofu, tomatoes, tortillas
Your story: You’re 20 years old, and one broke cookie. After moving to the big city to “make it,” you’re now just barely making rent. What you do have, though, is a teeny bit of play money—300 smackeroos, to be exact—to blow on whatever your little heart fancies. Getting freebie yoga classes by volunteering at a studio takes care of your workout requirement. For entertainment, there’s Saturday night penny poker with friends with a one-dollar buy-in, lubricated with only the finest: Two Buck Chuck from Trader Joe’s. And one mustn’t forget the 2am, 100-percent-off Dumpster Food Special—don’t knock that free-ness until you’re a hungry activist with nothing to spend but goodwill and your youth. The one thing you don’t count change on is the best body care on the market—Zuzu Luxe cosmetics, Derma e moisturizer, and Giovanni hair prods so that your hair shines like the million bucks that you so don’t have. At the market, your motto is: Waste not, want not. Frugality certainly needn’t equate with fuddy-duddyness, and with smart buys you’ll be able to make great meals—this week and next week. Combine simple flavors for scrumptious results. Make quick tacos of beans, rice, and grilled green onions; warm, homey miso soup with spinach and cubed tofu; quick, crustless quiche with broccoli and bell pepper; and, of course, all the Elvis-style peanut-butter-and-banana sandwiches you like. The Up & Coming Do-Gooder
Disposable income: $3,000/year
What’s in your shopping cart?: Weekly home delivery from local CSA, Geoff Rowley-designed Vans slip-ons
Inner circle: Friends from yoga class, the waitress at the local veg diner
Fave dining spot: Soul Vegetarian in Atlanta
Last vacation: Weekend getaway to Portland, Ore.
Must-have groceries: Angel-hair pasta, balsamic vinegar, capers, cherry tomatoes, frozen artichokes, peaches, pineapple, red-leaf lettuce, rice-wine vinegar, russet potatoes, shiitake mushrooms
Your story: Congrats! You’ve landed that non-profit job stabbing baby seal clubbers in the eye. (Figuratively speaking, duh. What? You think this work pays?) This affords you, oh, $3,000 a year in splurge funds. First big buy? That would be a Vitamix and some cookbooks, maybe Moskowitz’s, since you’re all post-punk now. Later, for a special-occasion treat, go nuts on Chinese Laundry satin flats and a real swank haircut à la Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction at your neighborhood Paul Mitchell salon. At home, get all fancy with some organic hemp sheets to roll around in while you dream of the day that the seal-pelt industry officially becomes the seal-hugging industry. Breathe a little breath of relaxation: you’ve got enough money in the bank to cover this grocery trip, and could even indulge in a post-grocery-shopping latte, so you can be a little looser with your purse strings. By adding more flavor-packed elements, like shiitake mushrooms, you’ll get more out of your meals for just a few extra bucks. Take your everyday eats to the next level this week with flavorful additions to staple meals. For dinners, make quick Italian-inspired pasta tossed with capers and artichokes or oven-roasted potatoes with a chopped-shiitake drizzle. When the urge for something sweet hits, splash fresh peaches with balsamic vinegar for a light, refreshing dessert. The High-Rolling Herbivore
Disposable income: $30,000/year
What’s in your shopping cart?: Truffle oil, Prius with hemp interior, solar-paneled summer house in the Hamptons
Inner circle: Joaquin Phoenix, Natalie Portman, and the owners of New York City’s Jivamukti Yoga School
Fave dining spot: Candle Café in Manhattan
Last vacation: Dubai
Must-have groceries: Apricots, asparagus, avocados, blueberries, Bosc pears, broccolini, fennel, French fingerling potatoes, fresh artichokes, garam masala, hemp oil, kalamata olives, raspberries, saffron, smoked paprika, star anise, white truffle oil
Your story: Sure, you’re used to a steadier—and stronger—cash flow than most, but it’s still a good idea to take stock of how your stocks are being spent. After opening your own yoga studio, it’s time to hook up a few of those young-and-hungry activists—who could have been you earlier in life—with work-trade gigs. With a surplus $30,000 to spend this year, you’ll be jetting to Thailand for the Phuket Vegetarian Festival. After that, instead of heading straight to New York City for a weekend of overindulging on Olsenhaus shoes, like you might have in years past, order those puppies online. Of course, one mustn’t forget one’s roots: make hefty donations to Food Not Bombs, Mercy For Animals, and Animal Place to fund all your fellow activists and animal rescuers, many of whom depend on donations and get really strapped for cash during hard times. Since you’ve been pretty tame in your big-time spending—not even one trip to the French Riviera this year!—feel free to indulge when it comes to food. Exotic spices are really what set this list apart, as they’ll transform any recipe into five-star fare. Fancier veggies lend themselves to more indulgent cooking, so go on, get some equally inspiring seasonings to make their flavors really pop. When you’re using top-notch ingredients, cook to impress: finish off your fingerling-potato salad with white-truffle oil, caramelize your pears in sugar and star anise, and make simple salads explode with flavor when you combine avocado, fennel, raspberries, and a hemp-oil-based dressing. Of course, hosting a dinner for a few of those up-and-comers who still can’t quite afford the goodies you can, will make everything taste better. "
LUNCHROOM MAKEOVER,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/lunchroom-makeover,"MAY 11, 2009","Does British chef Jamie Oliver ever sleep? We’re not convinced he does. In addition to authoring cookbooks, residing over restaurants, and hosting several TV shows, he also squeezes in time for philanthropy with his School Dinners program. His efforts have improved the quality of food that’s available in countless British schools—and they have not gone unnoticed. After airing a surprisingly popular segment on Jamie’s School Dinners on his KISS-FM radio show, Ryan Seacrest decided it was time for Jamie to take his show on the road. The show, which will air on ABC, will tackle unhealthy foods in schools and workplaces while offering more healthful alternatives. Although the diet he’s advocating isn’t purely veg, Jamie’s emphasis on locally produced whole foods is certainly better than the latest fast food offering. "
AG REFORM IN NEW YORK,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/ag-reform-in-new-york,"MAY 11, 2009","Farm animals in New York may find themselves living slightly happier lives in the near future. Assembly member Linda Rosenthal has put forward bill A08163, which would prohibit the confinement of breeding pigs, calves, and egg-laying hens to cages that severely restrict their movement. The Humane Society of the United States and Farm Sanctuary have already expressed their support for this bill, which is strikingly similar to the California Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act passed last fall. The New York bill currently awaits approval from the Agriculture Committee. If it passes, New York will be the seventh state to implement this type of farm reform. Seven down, 43 to go … Hey, at least it’s a start! "
BARBARA WALTERS TALKS VEG,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/barbara-walters-talks-veg,"MAY 10, 2009","There are few things in the world that make us happier then hearing a well-known and respected public figure champion vegetarianism. Well, maybe hearing about happy animals would do the trick. Which means that today is one pretty amazing day, because Barbara Walters, moved by the story of Molly, a cow who escaped from a New York slaughterhouse, declared her intention to go veg, and even went so far as to say she’ll be bringing her own personal supply of veggie burgers with her to DC if need be. If you’d like to show your support for Barbara’s new pro-veg stance, be sure to send a message to The View. "
CASH FOR CLUNKERS QUESTIONS,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/cash-for-clunkers-questions,"MAY 10, 2009","When we heard that Congress was considering legislation that would allow SUV owners to trade in their gas-guzzling vehicles for cash, our first reaction was, hey, that’s not a bad idea. Unfortunately, things are never as simple as they seem, and this deal is not quite the victory for the environment we initially thought. In order to qualify for the $4,500 paycheck, car owners are asked to trade in their current vehicle for one that gets better gas mileage, which is great, but unfortunately the requirements are pretty lax. Cars that get 22 mpg, SUVs that get 18 mpg, and trucks that get 15 mpg would all qualify as “fuel efficient.” Do those numbers seem suspiciously low to anyone else? Just checking. "
MICHELLE OBAMA’S PSA,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/michelle-obamas-psa,"MAY 8, 2009","Joining a motley crew of alumni that includes the likes of LL Cool J, David Beckham, and Johnny Cash, Michelle Obama has shot a public service announcement with one of the most well-loved and recognizable celebrities of our time—Elmo. When she recently spoke before the United Nations in New York, Obama admitted that she was still on a high, and appearing on Sesame Street was the best thing she’s done all year. The short video shows the First Lady chatting with Elmo about her plans for the day, including eating a healthy lunch, reading a book, and going for a walk, and encourages parents to set a good example for their children. We wonder how Cookie Monster feels about all this … "
VENDING MACHINE REVAMP,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/vending-machine-revamp,"MAY 7, 2009","One of the most pervasive fixtures of the school hallway is creating a hostile environment and making it hard for students to lead normal lives. No, we’re not talking about the school bully, but a different source of unhappiness—the junk food vending machine. With 32 percent of American children estimated as overweight and 16 percent considered obese, it’s no secret that salty, sugary, and fat-filled snacks are doing nothing to remedy the situation. US Senators Tom Larkin and Lisa Murkowski are taking on this issue by introducing a bill that will establish nutrition standards for food and beverages sold in school vending machines. Here’s to helping kids make healthier choices! "
PBS TAKES ON TOXIC WATER,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/pbs-takes-on-toxic-water,"MAY 7, 2009","Think your triple-carbon-filtering, reverse osmosis-ing, super-distilling water purifier is doing the job? We hate to break it to you, but, quite frankly, it isn’t. The PBS Frontline story “Poisoned Waters” offers a startling and fascinating exposé explaining why. According to scientists, our water systems are saturated with waste particulates from synthetic drugs, agricultural pollutants, home waste treatments, lawn care chemicals, and household cleaners, many of which no water treatment system in the world is high-tech enough to trap. The good news is that the future of our water quality is in our hands. So do your part by going toxic-free by investing in environmentally friendly cleaning and beauty products, furniture, and even clothing—every little bit helps! "
FRANCE BOASTS BEST SLEEP,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/france-boasts-best-sleep,"MAY 6, 2009","As if we don’t have enough reasons to be jealous of the French already. In addition to their 35-hour workweek and amazing nationalized healthcare system, they excel at something, well two things, actually, that we Americans can’t seem to get right—eating and sleeping. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s most recent Society at a Glance report, the French spend more time eating every day than any of the other 18 developed nations they surveyed. Add that to the fact that they also spend more time sleeping—a full nine hours on average—and we’re starting to think that maybe it’s time to bid America adieu. But before you don the beret and baguette, take heart: Americans come in second with an average of 8.7 hours of sleep. "
AMAZON’S IMPROVED KINDLE,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/amazons-improved-kindle,"MAY 6, 2009","Ever wish you could bring all of your favorite veg reads with you wherever you go and get your hands on the most recent releases at the touch of a button? Well, now you can. And, thanks to Amazon’s new super-sized Kindle electronic reading device, you won’t need a magnifying glass to reference your tried-and-true recipes! Larger and more expensive than its predecessor, the new gadget, which will be released this summer, was designed with newspapers, magazines, and textbooks in mind. Weighing in at 10.2 ounces and capable of storing 3,500 books, this handy dandy tool will allow you to keep every VN issue right by your side! "
STARBUCKS’ GLUTEN-FREE GOODS,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/starbucks-gluten-free-goods,"MAY 5, 2009","With most of its menu items infamously far from free, Starbucks’ latest baked good is certainly free of one thing: gluten. For about two dollars, customers can now purchase a 100 percent gluten-free Valencia Orange Cake sold in an individually wrapped package. Although vegetarian, the cake does contain eggs, so if you’re looking for something vegan to go with your triple-mocha-latte-double-espresso-Frappuccino, you’ll have to stick with the oatmeal or fresh fruit for now. But that’s not to say that this new item appeared out of nowhere; in fact, it was supplied, like most things, upon demand. Starbucks’ website conveniently allows customers to submit ideas for how to improve the company and its menu. How about more cruelty-free coffee companions? Just to throw one out there… "
CHOCOLATE & VEGETABLE BIOFUEL,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/chocolate-andamp-vegetable-biofuel,"MAY 5, 2009","It’s no big secret that the VN staff doesn’t operate optimally without chocolate, but apparently we’re not the only ones. Drs. Kerry Kirwin, Steve Maggs, and James Meredith at the University of Warwick in the UK have invented a race car that runs on our favorite treat. Technically—and thankfully—the first biofuel-based race car will be fueled with chocolate waste and vegetable oil, rather than squares of Green & Black’s. The “WorldFirst Formula 3 racing car” also boasts a steering wheel made from carrot and other root-vegetable-based fibers and a seat made of flax fiber and soybean oil foam. Oh, and engineers hope it will reach speeds upwards of 145 mph. Not too shabby for a plant-based diet! "
EU BANS SEAL PRODUCTS FROM TRADE,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/eu-bans-seal-products-from-trade,"MAY 4, 2009","Today marks victory for Canadian seals and the ProtectSeals campaign, as The European Union (EU) has finally declared an official ban on trading products derived from the annual seal slaughter. The legislation will result in catastrophic economic losses for Canada, with experts estimating that the prohibition will cost the industry an average of $5.6 million each year, well over 90 percent of its usual annual revenue. With 60,000 seals killed so far this season, sealers are already well below their quota of 280,000. Thanks and congratulations to the myriad animal rights advocates around the world who lobbied, petitioned, and protested against the seal slaughter atrocities! "
RECORD-BREAKING HEALTH PROBLEMS,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/record-breaking-health-problems,"MAY 4, 2009","From antibiotics to X-rays, medical technology impacts our health on a daily basis. While we’d like to think that our lives are improving and sickness is diminishing, a recent article on Live Science examines why humans are actually suffering from some illnesses at record-breaking rates. Diabetes, obesity, and even hay fever are now more common than ever. It’s no secret that increasingly sedentary lifestyles and junk-food-fueled diets mean childhood obesity and asthma occurrences are also at all-time highs. Their standard prescription seems to persist: move more and eat less to live a longer, illness-free existence. "
COK URGES EGG-FREE PLEDGE,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/cok-urges-egg-free-pledge,"MAY 3, 2009","Now that Easter is over, the egg industry is finding itself in a bit of a slump. The solution? Encourage mass consumption of eggs through its “National Egg Month” campaign. Compassion Over Killing is rolling the situation on its elliptical head by kicking off its second annual Crack the Cruelty campaign and urging people to take a month-long pledge to eliminate eggs from their diet. But this campaign is about more than saying “no” to eggs—it’s about saying “yes” to innovative recipes, amazing veg products, oh, and maybe there’s an issue of VegNews in it for you, too. That’s right: The first 200 people to sign the online pledge will receive a free copy of our humble little publication. So come on, we don’t want to hear any “egg”scuses! "
SUNLESS TANNING,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/sunless-tanning,"MAY 2, 2009","Maybe you want all the bronze glory of having spent roughly six hours a day in direct sunlight, but you happen to have this little thing called a “life” that prevents you from spending that much time totally inert. Or, maybe your neighborhood park is just a teeny bit too cold/creepy/dog-poop filled to bust out your bikini right now. Whatever your reason, if you long for the same ad-tan-tage as people who live in the Florida Keys, without risking overexposure, look no further than Alba Botanica’s Golden Tan Sunless Tanning Lotion. This totally vegan, orange-residue-free balm gives a subtle, golden base that will make it look like you don’t live in a cave. Of course, if you aren’t laying out, don’t forget to fortify your diet with a little extra vitamin D! "
GREEN YOUR OFFICE,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/green-your-office,"MAY 2, 2009","Maybe you work at home and your idea of “going to the office” is staying in bed and typing while still wearing your pjs, with a puppy curled up at your feet and never-ending access to your kitchen—just in case you decide to whip up a mid-morning snack that didn’t come packaged in foil. Well, kudos. Chances are, if you have a home office, you’re your own cleaning crew, and you wouldn’t dream of using anything other than natural, eco-friendly products to spruce up your space. Since you wouldn’t use them in your home (even if it isn’t also your office), why allow nasty chemicals into your workplace? For those whose commute is farther than the couch, here are a few handy tips for giving your cubicle the green spring clean befitting of a home-away-from-home. The Clean Sweep
Of course, the obvious place to start is with actual cleaning products. Say you happen to have someone who’s something of a klutz for a co-worker, and he or she is continually spilling coffee all over creation. In case said coffee has landed on your clothing, we know one thing that is sure to get it out: Holy Cow Concentrated Cleaner. Designed to clean everything—and we mean everything—this green-liquid-filled spray bottle is your one-stop shop for spills of all sorts and really, actually, reliably gets ink stains out. Trust us, when that pen explodes in the pocket of the fancy French-cuff shirt you just splurged on, Holy Cow will become your new deity of choice. Break It Down
Ah, the break room: repository for scary, foil-and-sticky-note-clad leftovers, battleground for “who drank the last of my soy creamer!” fights, and littering locale for altogether too many spent sugar packets. First step to greening up the workday watering hole is to make sure that it’s free of nasty bits—aka meat and dairy. Since we know that animal products wreak havoc on the environment, it’s best to exclude them from the get-go. Soy creamer, fair-trade coffee and tea, and bulk sweeteners (think agave) will get your brain buzzing. Should some of said sweetener drip on the counter, would you be caught dead with a paper towel in hand? Definitely not. Get ye a Twist Sponge Cloth, which is totally biodegradable and lasts 1,000 times longer than even the brawniest paper towel. Agent Orange
OK, maybe this isn’t something you want to read aloud in polite company, but definitely needs discussing—if only to ensure that, oh, say, your next big-time client meeting isn’t derailed by a malodorous bathroom odor. It can certainly be tricky to maintain a professional demeanor when the office atmosphere is more reminiscent of a boys’ locker room than a place of business. To freshen up, spritz a little Air Scense about, or, if your workspace isn’t a paper-laden fire hazard, light up your favorite A Scent of Scandal candle. "
INTERVIEW WITH ANIMAL PHILANTHROPIST JOSH HOOTEN,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/interview-with-animal-philanthropist-josh-hooten,"MAY 2, 2009","Josh Hooten wears a lot of hats: business owner (he’s the founder of Herbivore Magazine and Herbivore Clothing), family guy (dad to daughter Ruby and husband to wife Michelle), blogger, and now, philanthropic adventurer. On May 6 Hooten leaves his home in Portland, Ore., will climb upon his two-wheel steed, and will head in the direction of Orland, Calif. Why? To raise $10,000 for Farm Sanctuary, celebrate 10 years of being vegan, and inspire others to adopt a compassionate lifestyle. Before hitting the road, Hooten chatted with VN about food, philanthropy, and farm animals. VegNews: Six hundred miles. Sheesh! I’m already tired and you haven’t even left yet. Why a cycling fundraiser instead of, say, a bake sale?
Josh Hooten: Why didn’t I think of a bake sale?! I could have avoided riding up so many damn hills! Actually, if I had a bake sale I’d eat everything before it even got started, and I’m chubby enough as it is, so that’s out. You know, I’m just a big fan of bikes as a mode of transportation. I wish more people would ride them, as the benefits to our bodies, our inner lives, our planet, etc. are huge. Perhaps someone will be inspired to start commuting a few miles to work by bike when they see me taking this on. I believe bikes connect us to our own bodies, our communities, and our environment in a very meaningful way, so I’m trying to promote that as well. VN: What is it about Farm Sanctuary’s work that prompted you to make the organization the beneficiary of this fundraiser?
JH: I’ve been fortunate enough to visit both farms, and I think those lovely creatures that are lucky enough to live there have so much power to inspire people to go vegan, which is the best thing anybody can do to help animals. The power those animals have when we are allowed to watch them live free of torment and confinement is just amazing to me. It’s hard to go there and not leave changed. I’m really looking forward to getting back down there and hanging out with the critters again; it just never gets old, and the re-invigoration I feel never wanes. VN: You’ll be camping out most nights, eh? What kind of campfire fare will you be tucking into each night? What kinds of comestibles will you be carrying with you?
JH: First, you spelled “cosmetics” wrong. I will be carrying lots of black eyeliner and black fingernail polish so as to appear more emo and piratey. And, yes, camping most nights. I’ll have my little camping stove and one decent-sized pot. I’ve mapped out the grocery stores along the way, so I will have access to pasta, veggies, oatmeal, black tea, bagels, beans, peanut butter, tofu, and, if the fates are on my side, soy ice cream, preferably Temptation from Chicago Soy Dairy. VN: What’s happening at Herbivore Clothing Company these days?
JH: We’re doing tons of new designs on hoodies, belts, shirts, all kinds of stuff. We’re always adding new cookbook titles to our offerings. When I get back we’re going to get a couple of books off to the printer that will feature collected interviews from Herbivore Magazine. Most of our issues are now out of print, so we’re going to anthologize the best stuff. I helped found the Let Live Conference, which is coming up June 26?28. I’m going to be tabling with our stuff at most of the bigger conferences this summer and Fall, so hopefully folks will stop by and say hi. We’ve got some other book projects in the works as well, and I’m sure I’m forgetting something! VN: What’s next?
JH: I’ve been urging people to try and get creative in their advocacy for animals for a long time now. Figure out what you’re good at and what you enjoy, and find a way to help animals doing it. I’m trying to walk that walk with this bike ride, so whatever is next will be along those lines. "
JACK-RUSSELL MUMMY FOUND,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/jack-russell-mummy-found,"MAY 2, 2009","It’s no secret that ancient Egyptians were skilled at embalming and preserving their dead. For quite some time now, archaeologists have been unearthing mummified humans, cats, birds, and even crocodiles, but a recent discovery has researchers a little surprised. A tomb inscribed with the phrase “Hapi-Men” contained not only a human mummy, but a dog resembling a Jack Russell terrier, which researchers are now calling “Hapi-Puppy.” There is some evidence of ancient Egyptians keeping dogs as companions, and even giving them names such as “Brave One” or “Useless.” However, with very few mummified dogs having ever been found, Hapi-Puppy has a claim to fame as one of the rarest mummified animals. We can’t say we find this all too surprising, though. After all, who could resist the adorable face and extreme intelligence of a Jack Russell terrier? "
THIS WEEK’S GIVEAWAY: VEGAN CANDY BARS!,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/this-weeks-giveaway-vegan-candy-bars,"MAY 2, 2009","Being vegan is easier than ever, especially with the occasional sweet indulgence that makes us so very happy. VegNews couldn’t be more excited to report the launch of four decadent new candy bars by Go Max Go Foods in flavors that may sound familiar. We went nuts for the Mahalo bar, an Almond Joy-like treat filled with coconut, almonds, and covered with a rice-milk chocolate coating. The Twilight bar features rich caramel, chocolate nougat, and a chocolate coating, while the Jokerz is loaded with peanuts, nougat, and caramel. Yum. VegNews has a sample pack of all four bars, and we’d love to give them away to one lucky winner. Simply tell us your favorite sweet indulgence, and we’ll randomly choose one person to receive these incredible candy bars. Good luck! "
VEG DIET DOMINATES DIABETES,https://vegnews.com/2009/5/veg-diet-dominates-diabetes,"MAY 1, 2009","Meet diabetes’ newest nemesis—your vegan diet! With more than one in 10 American adults already dealing with the disease, discovering an antidote for diabetes ranks right up there with finding a cure for heart disease and cancer. A recent report, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, offers some promising implications. Researchers found that diabetes patients following a low-fat, vegan diet not only lost weight, but also improved their blood sugar levels and cholesterol over the course of one year. This was the first study of its kind to assess the long-term effects of meat-free eating habits on glucose control. Whether you have diabetes or not, weight, blood sugar, and cholesterol are always good things to keep in check! "
SNEAKY SALT AFFECTS HEALTH,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/sneaky-salt-affects-health,"APRIL 30, 2009","Think reducing salt in your diet just means reaching for the shaker a little less often? Sure, that’s part of it, but it turns out that the majority of the sodium in Americans’ diets comes not in those visible white granules, but from processed foods, such as deli meats, canned goods, fast foods, and even breakfast cereals. Scientists have linked excessive salt consumption to increased risk for hypertension, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and stroke; in fact, the American Medical Association estimates that if Americans cut their salt consumption in half over the next 10 years, 150,000 premature deaths will be prevented annually. The New York City Health Department and Mayor Bloomberg have taken this issue to heart, teaming up with food industry leaders to reduce the amount of salt in their products. As always, the bottom line stays the same: Read labels religiously and rely on whole foods to maintain the healthiest possible diet. "
SILVERSTONE’S NEW VEG BOOK,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/silverstones-new-veg-book,"APRIL 30, 2009","Of all the words we typically use to describe American diets, “kind” is just not one you hear all too often. But that’s about to change, thanks to Alicia Silverstone’s yet-to-be-released diva diet book. In The Kind Diet, which is set to hit shelves this fall, Silverstone dishes a three-step wellness program in addition to 75 macrobiotic and vegan recipes. Following in the footsteps of Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin, this long-time vegan and animal-rights advocate aims to address the physical, emotional, and environmental effects of our diets, thereby encouraging people to make more compassionate choices. So, if you haven’t updated your reading list already, now’s the time to go ahead and jot this one down! "
“SUPER” TOMATOES HIT SHELVES,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/super-tomatoes-hit-shelves,"APRIL 29, 2009","Regulars of the packed lunch crowd know that tomatoes can either be friend or foe to the lovable lunchbox. While it’s true that they make for a tasty addition to just about any sandwich, if left to sit for too long, they seep into the bread, making everything soggy and unappetizing. This may not be the case for much longer, though, thanks to the super non-leaking tomatoes that have already hit the market in Britain. The supermarket chain, Tesco, just released these Dutch-grown super-fruits, which allegedly only lose three percent of their moisture compared to an average tomato’s 12 percent. While it’s an interesting idea, we think we’ll stick with our organic heirlooms and assemble our sandwiches just before eating. "
US AIR QUALITY STILL LOW,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/us-air-quality-still-low,"APRIL 29, 2009","According to the American Lung Association, most Americans will want to keep their deep yoga breathing to a minimum. In its 10th annual State of the Air report, which ranked the top 25 most and least air-polluted places, the organization warned that, although air quality has improved over the past 40 years, its condition is still considered unhealthy for most Americans. Since unclean air is a serious risk factor for lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, and shortened life span, check out your local results to see if you should consider moving “up where the air is clear,” e.g., Fargo, ND or Wahpeton, Minn. Or take less drastic measures to reduce pollution by conserving energy, reducing driving time, and burning eco-friendly kindling. "
RECYCLING ON THE RISE,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/recycling-on-the-rise,"APRIL 28, 2009","Have you already put aside plastic in favor of glass food containers and reusable shopping bags? Regardless of your personal plastic policy, you’ll be happy to know that by the year 2015 plastic bags will consist of 40 percent recycled content. At least that is the goal of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), which has invested $50 million to that end. Although bag recycling increased by 27 percent from 2005 to 2007, the EPA reports that in the US, the majority of plastic bags still end up in landfills or in natural wildlife habitats. Do your part to reduce unnecessary waste by remembering your reusable or recycling your plastic! "

SWINE FLU SPREADS,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/swine-flu-spreads,"APRIL 27, 2009","So, by now, you’ve probably heard word—and hopefully steered clear—of the swine flu virus that’s infected hundreds and swept the world with fear. With over 200 cases already reported across the globe, the virus appears to pass easily from person to person. It remains unclear where the illness originated, although the majority and most severe cases have been reported in Mexico. An influenza strain called H1N1, which has genetic material from the viruses that typically attack birds, humans and pigs, is being blamed for the outbreak. With an estimated three quarters of human illness originating with wildlife, some experts are already pointing fingers at the filthy conditions of factory farms. Funny how they seem to be taking the rap for many of the world’s maladies these days. "
VEGNEWS WINS TWO MAGGIES,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/vegnews-wins-two-maggies,"APRIL 27, 2009","Every year the Western Publishing Association gets together to examine all periodicals produced on the West Coast and decide which are the best of the bunch. Approximately 100 judges spend three days deliberating entries for more than 100 categories in editorial, design, and promotion. At this year’s 58th award ceremony, held in Los Angeles on Friday, April 24, VegNews walked away with not one, but two of the 78 Maggies presented! Attended by more than 500 publishing professionals, the black-tie event is the largest publishing awards ceremony in the Western United States. Publishers and co-founders Joseph Connelly and Colleen Holland were there in person to accept the awards for Lifestyles & Alternative Lifestyles and Best Web Publication Website.

That’s Prince Charles, of course, who will join the growing list of celebs and political figures taking on the world, quite literally. This week he announced his involvement in a forthcoming book and documentary. Both works will explore how humans can harmoniously coexist with nature and examine how to achieve a balance between ecology and economy. The proceeds from the book, called Harmony, will go to his charitable foundation, The Prince’s Trust. We wonder if he’ll enlist the help of his cute-as-a-button sons William and Harry to star in the movie. Here’s hoping! "
FLEA COLLARS’ HAZARDS,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/flea-collars-hazards,"APRIL 26, 2009","Protecting your family and animal companions from fleas and ticks sounds like a great idea. Upping their risk for cancer and neurological damage, on the other hand, sounds like, well, not such a great idea. However, a startling new study suggests the two may be intrinsically linked. In fact, levels of propoxure and tetrachloryinphos, known carcinogens and neurotoxins, were found at a level 1,000 times higher than the EPA has set for children. The Natural Resource Defense Council discovered hazardous chemical residue left on animals’ fur following flea and tick collar use, even two weeks after removal. These toxins pose an even greater risk to youngsters, since their nervous systems haven’t fully developed. Our advice? Either live with the pests or opt for a natural alternative! "
SLEEP PATTERNS AFFECT FOCUS,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/sleep-patterns-affect-focus,"APRIL 25, 2009","Are you up with the sun, or do prefer to burn the midnight oil? While most people naturally fall into one of these two general camps, recent research reveals that your sleep cycle may impact more than just what time your alarm clock goes off. According to Science journal, while early birds may save money on their dinner, their concentration supply tends to be spent long before that of night owls. Scientists tested participants’ attention span 1.5 hours and 10.5 hours after waking; while they observed similar focus levels early on, night owls proved significantly more alert later in the day. Whether sleep patterns affect learning and memory, however, has yet to be determined. "
VEGFUND FEEDS THE WORLD,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/vegfund-feeds-the-world,"APRIL 25, 2009","Ever wish you could feed the world with delicious vegetarian food, if only to prove how utterly delicious veg-friendly fare can be? Well now you can—for free! Thanks, that is, to an all-vegan trio who’ve made it their mission to acquaint the general public with the joys of a plant-based diet. Zia Terhune, Rae Sikora, and JC Corcoran teamed up three months ago to create VegFund, a non-profit organization based in Gainsville, Fla., offering funding for free vegan food at mainstream events. But, wait, there’s more. Not only will VegFund pay the food bill, it will also cover the cost of supplies, education materials, and booth fees. And just to throw in a little something extra, the organization will send recipes and posters to food providers to display during the show. A compassionate network of partners around the world is also available to facilitate planning, preparing, and serving efforts. OK, so you’re probably thinking there’s got to be some kind of catch—but, for once, there isn’t. In fact, VegFund doesn’t even ask that donation recipients mention its name at the event. With a steady supply of funding from an anonymous donor, this organization has one goal in mind: To reach out to the non-veg public with delicious vegan food and literature that explains why opting for a compassionate lifestyle is such an important choice to make. Now’s your chance to help spread the word—and the food. With more than 100 international events already under its belt, this non-profit is well on its way to world veganization. “We hope to continue to spread this message internationally until the scales tip so that veganism becomes mainstream and eating animal products is a thing of the past,” explains Sikora. VegFund ’s all-volunteer staff and strategic approach means that it has plenty of food to go around. “We would love to have so many people wanting to create food for events that we have to get more funding! At this time, we are not close to having more requests than funding.” The organization is currently dishing out thousands of dollars every week to support its mission. So if you know of an upcoming event—perhaps one you are already planning to attend—that could use some cruelty-free food, be sure to take advantage of VegFund ’s offer and take it upon yourself to teach people how tasty eating veg can be. Think you’re ready to plan your own VegFund-fed event? Follow these simple steps to ensure success:
1. Before the event: Find a non-veg event, fill out a few simple forms, and prepare a menu.
2. During the event: Provide food and literature for attendees and snap some photos.
3. After the event: Send in a brief report, photos, and receipts to VegFund. Congratulations—you’re done! "
CALIFORNIA’S ECO LEGISLATION,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/californias-eco-legislation,"APRIL 24, 2009","It’s no secret that California is a trend-setting state, but Thursday, April 23 marked the start of a truly groundbreaking initiative. California’s Air Resources board approved a regulation to cut down on the carbon content of the state’s fuels by 2020. This is part of the Golden State’s larger plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the same time frame, and the first regulation of its type to be approved—anywhere. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger lauded the legislation, citing it as a way to encourage innovation. Now it’s just a matter of time until other states follow California’s trailblazing footsteps. "

If you live in Northern California, though, you’ll have to wait until early August—at least according to the Natural Resources Defense Council’s recently released “What’s Fresh Near You” online tool. This new website fills you in on what’s growing in your neck of the woods by allowing you to search by state and date to see what type of produce is ripe and ready to eat. If you’re curious as to how far your food is traveling, you can also ask your store manager, farm vendor, or the little sticker stuck on your banana. After all, local is not only better for the planet, but better for you—and your taste buds! "

No, it’s not a new club in Hollywood, New York, or even London, but an ominous mountain in Africa surrounded by volcanic peaks. It may be a little hard to imagine Justin Timberlake, Lupe Fiasco, and Kenna strutting their stuff all the way to the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania—Africa’s highest point—but that’s exactly where the trio says they’ll be heading this fall. Their hike isn’t just for kicks, though, since they’ll be using their adventure to raise awareness of the worldwide water crisis. We can’t wait to see the footage—and hope Justin and his gang are the first of many celebs who’ll take on such a worthy cause. "
CONNECTICUT’S GARBAGE MUSEUM,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/connecticuts-garbage-museum,"APRIL 22, 2009","One ton. What exactly does that hefty amount represent? Not only is it the amount of garbage and recyclables discarded annually by the average person in Connecticut, but it’s also the weight of the Trash-o-saurus, a found-item sculpture that welcomes guests at Connecticut’s Garbage Museum. This unusual-sounding facility, run by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, gives kids plenty of food for thought about what happens once they throw something away. In addition to observing recycling in action, visitors can walk through a (fake) tunnel of compost and participate in a “trash bash” game show to demonstrate their waste-related wisdom. Personally, we’ll give the compost tunnel a pass, but anything that gets kids thinking about the environment gets the (biodegradable, of course) VN seal of approval. "

Oh, and did we mention that she was named “Person of the Year” in our 2008 Veggie Awards? Well, in addition to all those awesome accolades, she’s continuing to bring veganism to the masses, as the cover girl and featured interviewee in the May issue of Experience Life magazine.

ONLINE VEGAN VIDEO STAR JOANNE ROSE,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/online-vegan-video-star-joanne-rose,"APRIL 20, 2009","For the most part, we vegetarians tend to take the cruelty-free commitment pretty seriously. But that doesn’t mean we don’t have a healthy appetite for humor. Let’s face it: being veg in a very non-veg world certainly brings about its own awkward, amusing, and oh-so memorable moments. Accomplished author, kitchen diva, model, and actress, Joanne Rose makes light of such blips in an upcoming series of video sketches, Vegan 101. As the author, co-director, and lead actress of these short films, this 32-year-old Australian native will be featured on her website. VN got all the details from this proud producer in a pre-release interview. VegNews: We were excited to hear word of your upcoming sketch comedy Dating a Vegan, going to production next month. Please do dish!
Joanne Rose: I am developing Vegan 101 as a web series and stage show, which will feature comedic sketches about being a vegan—in highly exaggerated situations. People will be able to see it online through veganvision.net and on stage in New York and Los Angeles. The idea is to inspire, educate, and entertain all at the same time. People love to laugh and be entertained, so it’s a way of informing others about veganism in a different light. VN: What is veganvision.net?
JR: Veganvision.net is a company I founded and created to provide vegan education via advice, presentations, recipes, personalized meal plans, shopping tips, children?s books, film, TV, and stage. VN: Can you tell me a little bit about the inspiration and purpose for taking on Dating a Vegan?
JR: I wanted to do a take on awkward moments, which seems to be something most vegans have encountered at some stage of dating. I hope to achieve international success so the word “vegan” becomes a strong part of global vocabulary, which will influence others to learn about the lifestyle through curiosity and fascination. With entertainment, people won’t shun away. VN: Are there any other sketches in the works?
JR: I have just completed another comedic sketch for Vegan 101 called “The Church of Vegan-ology.” I plan to do a reading in New York City this summer and a performance in Los Angeles. VN: What do you hope to accomplish in the next five years? The next 20?
JR: I would love to continue acting and establish Vegan 101 as a successful TV series. It would be great to have some celebrity vegan actors make cameo appearances, and I would love to work with Ed Begley, Jr., Linda Blair, Emily Deschanel, and Joaquin Phoenix. In the next 20 years I would love to see a massive increase in the number of vegans worldwide. VN: How long have you been vegan and what originally inspired you to give up animal products?
JR: Since 1994. I was always an animal lover but never thought about what I was truly eating. When I became aware, I was absolutely devastated. I became a vegetarian for a few months before comfortably transitioning in to veganism. I couldn’t justify doing it half way, as it seemed so wrong to depend on animals for human consumption in any sense. "

No one even checks in on them until they’ve reached their final destination and there’s definitely no such thing as a “bathroom break.” But now Count Pounce and Barky will be sitting pretty, thanks to the innovative services offered by Pet Airways. Not only does the airline assign an attendant to each “pawsenger”—to use the official airline terminology—but guardians can use an online tracker to monitor their travel progress. The downside? Pet Airways doesn’t allow “pet parents” on board, so you’ll have to find your own transportation. "

VegNews: How long did it take you to convince Amici’s to carry vegan cheese and why did you choose this chain?
Karin Olsson: I reached out to several pizza chains, and Amici’s was immediately responsive. The staff at Amici’s was wonderful to work with and recognized that offering vegan cheese wasn’t just the right thing to do, it was also good for business. VN: Can anyone convince a chain to carry vegan options, or is there a certain prestige that comes with working for a group like HSUS that makes it more likely for them to listen to you?
KO: Definitely! More than anything, customer feedback and offering examples of vegan options to chefs is most important in doing restaurant outreach. Businesses want to make sure their customers are happy. Everyone should feel empowered to reach out to businesses and request vegan options. My main advice is to keep in touch with the restaurant consistently. If restaurants know you’re not going away they’re more likely to realize how serious you are and are more likely to change. VN: What are your top three tips for asking restaurants to carry vegan options?
KO: 1. Be friendly and polite. Let the restaurant know you are a loyal customer but would love to see more vegan options on their menu. 2. Do your research. Figure out which dishes could be easily veganized, and provide the restaurant with samples of tasty vegan products that would fit into their menu. The easier you make it for the restaurant to add vegan items, the more likely they will be to do so. 3. Follow up. Follow up. And follow up. Sometimes making these changes can take time and be daunting for a restaurant. By keeping it on their radar and offering to help out, you can ensure that the restaurant follows through. VN: What’s next? Do you have another chain that you’re currently working with or is there one you’d like to focus on in the future?
KO: We’d love to see more universities offering vegan meat alternatives such as Gardein. These are a great (and delicious!) way to get students to eat animal-friendly foods, and are really easy additions to any menu. The Humane Society of the United States has had a lot of success working with universities across the country in adding vegan meat to their dining operations. This type of campaigning for farm animals is something any one individual can do. "
PHOTO FORECASTING,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/photo-forecasting,"APRIL 18, 2009","It’s time to dig out the old photo albums—and check out the size of your smile. If you’d like to learn the likelihood you and your loved one will be living happily ever after, that is. Associate professor of psychology, Matt Hertenstein, and his team at DePauw University in Indiana recently made a remarkable love-related discovery: the bigger your childhood grin, the greater your chances of successful marriage. Youthful frowners, on the other hand, were five times more likely to file for divorce than their smiling counterparts. What’s the connection? Scientists hypothesize that happy people tend to wed partners with similarly positive emotionality and generally have greater support networks. So go ahead and smile for the camera! "
CLINTON’S CAMPAIGN DEBT,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/clintons-campaign-debt,"APRIL 17, 2009","It’s not every day that you get a private audience with a former president, but that could all change today. In the run up to the 2008 election, Hillary Clinton amassed a substantial debt, and her efforts to pay it off are getting, well, pretty creative. Technically the scheme is not Hillary’s doing, since, as Secretary of State, she’s no longer able to participate in fundraising. But it’s a bit hard to believe that her former campaign manager, James Carville, came up with the idea of offering a day with Bill Clinton as a raffle prize on his own. We just hope that whoever wins has the good sense to take Bill out to DC’s newest veg haven, Café Green. "
BREAKING THE MILK MYTH,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/breaking-the-milk-myth,"APRIL 16, 2009","The only way to build strong bones is to drink milk by the gallon, right? Despite the fact that certain industries have built entire ad campaigns around that very premise, the link between dairy consumption and bone strength is now more tenuous than ever. A study conducted by Sydney’s Garvan Institute of Medical Research compared the bone densities of 105 vegan Buddhist nuns to those of 105 non-vegans in the same age group. The findings? The average bone mass of the two groups was identical, despite the fact that the vegans’ protein and calcium intake tended to be lower than the control group’s. So if you’re worried about building better bones, you can forget about the milk and pile your plate with leafy greens and whole grains. "
TELLING TAILS,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/telling-tails,"APRIL 16, 2009","Long-term surveillance and analysis of isotopes found in the subjects’ hair may sound like something out of a spy movie, but in this case, we’re talking biology, not Bond. For six years, National Academy of Science researchers in Kenya have been tracking a family of elephants, analyzing the chemical information embedded in hairs from their tails. Since water and grass from different sources contain varying quantities of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, scientists were able to get to the bottom of a mealtime mystery. The scientists concluded that the elephants had recently switched their source of grass, despite a steady supply, as a result of cattle grazing in the elephants’ usual stomping ground. Hopefully the crystallization of this conflict between the human and pachyderm eating habits gives Kenyans a huge reason to go veg. "
GMO-FREE GERMANY,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/gmo-free-germany,"APRIL 16, 2009","While the US has recently approved Monsanto’s genetically modified (GMO) sugar beets, Europe seems to be exercising a bit more caution. German Agriculture Minister Ilse Aigner has followed the lead of five fellow European nations by banning the cultivation of GMO maize, preventing nearly 9,000 acres from being harvested. France, Austria, Greece, Hungary, and Luxembourg have already outlawed Mon810, a variety of maize specifically bred to resist the corn borer, a moth larva that eats the stem of the plant. As the health and environmental side effects of GMO products have yet to be determined, European nations are justified in remaining wary of Monsanto’s methods. "
SEA SHEPHERD SAVES LIVES,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/sea-shepherd-saves-lives,"APRIL 14, 2009","If you thought pirates only patrolled the Caribbean, here’s news for you. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, with its unofficial pirate status, has made headlines across the world for its slightly-less-than-diplomatic efforts to cut this year’s whaling season short. Although the organization has taken credit for saving nearly 300 minke whales and 50 fin whales from Japanese whale hunters occupying the Antarctic, their ruthless efforts have raised valid concern. After following the Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha whaling ships for nearly 2,000 miles, the society rammed two Japanese ships and attacked whalers with acid-filled glass bottles. This clash is part of long dispute over the allowance of the annual whale hunt. Here’s hoping they’ll find a more peaceful solution! "
DANGEROUS DIETING,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/dangerous-dieting,"APRIL 14, 2009","What does going veg early in life mean for you? It may mean that you’re slimmer, trimmer, and healthier—or something else entirely. A recent American Dietetic Association study revealed that young vegetarians pick up several healthy herbivorous habits such as eating more fruits and vegetables and less fat. As a result, only 17 percent of vegetarians between the ages of 15 to 23 are overweight compared to 28 percent of non-vegetarians. However, the study also found that 15 to 18-year-old vegetarians are more likely than their peers to partake in binge eating and diet-pill popping. This disparity seems to disappear with age, which suggests that some adolescents may enlist vegetarianism as a deceptive dieting ploy. While we fully support going veg at any age, we urge teen herbivores to avoid “dieting” dilemmas and focus on staying healthy. "
OCEANIC GARBAGE PATCH,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/oceanic-garbage-patch,"APRIL 13, 2009","Trapped in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by a vortex of converging currents, there is an area larger than the state of Texas that’s filled with garbage. Oceanographer Charles Moore discovered the “Great Pacific Garbage Patch,” a mass of coat hangers, plastic bottles, truck tires, and other debris 10 years ago when sailing off the coast of Hawaii. Deeply moved by this dreadful discovery, British environmentalist and billionaire David de Rothschild has made publicizing its existence his primary goal. In a few weeks, de Rothschild will set out in a catamaran—called the Plastiki—constructed from 12,000 plastic bottles. As he attempts to sail from San Francisco to Sydney, he’ll be blogging about his voyage and uploading video footage. Here’s hoping his efforts show what kind of impact—both positive and negative—plastic has on our world. "

YOGA FOR DOGS,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/yoga-for-dogs,"APRIL 12, 2009","Regular yoga disciples are no doubt familiar with the “downward dog” position, but may be surprised to find, well, an actual dog in their class. “Doga,” or dog yoga classes offering a combination of stretches for both humans and their canine companions are being offered in studios throughout the US—and the rest of the world. If you’re looking for complete serenity and relaxation, you’ll probably want to stick to your usual classes, since some students complain about being distracted by their partners’ barking, inability to face the right direction, and incessant appetite for bite-sized treats. But to mix up your routine and spend some quality time with your pooch, it’s not a bad way to spend an hour. "
WHY WE SHOULD WATCH LESS TELEVISION (AND HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN),https://vegnews.com/2009/4/why-we-should-watch-less-television-and-how-to-make-it-happen,"APRIL 11, 2009","When my husband and I decided to raise our children as vegetarians, we did so believing this would give them the best chances of living a happy, healthy life, while also helping to change the world. But as we learned—and have observed in others—once you step off the mainstream path in any way, it can be an opening to reconsider other cultural norms. So consider television. More than anything else in our lives, television embodies, promotes, and reinforces values which we—and many other vegetarians we know—disagree with. It is a powerful voice that speaks to children, and most of what it says is contrary to our vegetarian ethics. According to Jerry Mander, author of the seminal work Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television, some technologies—television being the big one—are not neutral, but rather wield tremendous power. (Weapons of mass destruction are another example.) In fact, advertisers find television so effective at altering Americans’ behavior that, according to Nielsen Media Research, promoting specific food products is a multi-billion-dollar industry annually. Commercials getting the most air time sell the sort of fare that any health-conscious parent wouldn’t want their children to eat; think sugary, nutrient-deficient cereals, over-packaged and processed snack-foods loaded with hydrogenated fats, and saccharine soda pops full of hard-to-pronounce chemicals. But because the medium is both seductive and influential, parents aware of the propaganda can use the medium to reinforce their values rather then the cultural norm. Vegetarian values are likely to include respectful treatment of friends, family members, animals, and the natural world, which would preclude dramas depicting children and parents (or siblings) as antagonists. Commercials and dramas reinforce the unfortunate cultural norm that there is a pill for every ill—and that there’s no need to worry about the side-effects, while many vegetarians believe (and want their children to believe) that lifestyle adjustments should be our first response to pain, suffering, and many illnesses. But perhaps the one television-reinforced value that most undermines vegetarian values is that which is most basic to television itself: consumption. Commercials give impressionable minds the implication that life will be much better if products X, Y, and Z are purchased or consumed, and the message can make some feel inadequate if they don’t have access to the products peddled on the television screen. Few will argue that over-consumption is destroying the natural world, and that it is a factor in most wars. But for families who take the time to carefully select programs with age-appropriate content, your television can actually be used to enculturate children with healthy, compassionate values, and educate them in ways that promote—rather than undermine—democracy. Most parenting experts link television watching with behavioral problems, reduced academic performance, eating disorders (from anorexia to obesity) and decreased fitness. As parents, we have been more criticized for “depriving” our children of television then raising them dairy-free. But having abstained from television and videos when they were younger, at ages nine and 13, the technology itself is so novel that our children find low-key history, science, and biographical videos (from our library’s non-fiction section) enjoyable. And we are all grateful for our peaceful, health-conscious home. "
DR. GREGER’S HEDGEHOG HUMOR,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/dr-gregers-hedgehog-humor,"APRIL 10, 2009","He’s wearing a white lab coat and glasses, sitting proudly in front of The Humane Society of the United States logo, but Dr. Greger’s appearance on The Colbert Show is not nearly as serious as it sounds. Sure, he’s offering his medical opinion, but the topic is not vegetarianism or nutrition, but rather hedgehogs and the health threats they may or may not pose to the rural community of Lawrence, Kansas. Despite the fact that he’s being called on as an expert, you can always count on Dr. Greger for a dose of humor, and this little segment does not disappoint. Hats off to him for proving that vegetarians do have a sense of humor. "
NEW YORK’S SUGAR TAX,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/new-yorks-sugar-tax,"APRIL 9, 2009","If you’re on par with the rest of America, you probably pack in about a pound of refined sugar every week. While consuming such copious amounts of the sweetener, specifically in the form of soda and sports drinks, can lead to kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, and weight gain, if you live in New York City, this habit may soon lead you to the bank. Health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden—the man behind banning trans fats, disclosing chain restaurant calorie counts, and smothering public smoking—has proposed a “hefty” tax on sugar-soaked beverages in an effort to combat obesity and other health hazards. He estimates that such a tax could curb consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion in one year! "

YouTube’s EDU channel offers a rare glimpse inside the classroom doors of colleges nationwide, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and MIT. More than 100 schools have teamed up with the website, which offers everything from virtual campus tours to entire lectures.

CHOCOLATE BOOSTS BRAIN POWER,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/chocolate-boosts-brain-power,"APRIL 8, 2009","If you’re counting calories, chomping on some chocolate might help—boost your cognitive capacity, that is. Cocoa flavanols have already received praise for their depression and cardiovascular disease-fighting capabilities, but now scientists are exploring their brain-powering potential. In a recent study at the Brain, Performance, and Nutrition Research Centre at Northumbria University, participants who consumed very high levels of cocoa flavanols prior to crunching numbers performed significantly better than control subjects. Researchers credit the results to increased cerebral blood flow and improved concentration. The conclusion? Chowing down on some chocolate as you calculate your taxes may not be such a bad idea! "

MAPLE SYRUP SUPPLY LOW,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/maple-syrup-supply-low,"APRIL 7, 2009","One crucial condiment may soon be missing from your daily stack of good old-fashioned flapjacks. Industry trends suggest that America’s steady supply of maple syrup may soon be nearing its end. Since the production of sap depends so heavily upon very specific climate conditions, the past decade of warming weather and ensuing chemical pollutants and non-native pests has already taken its toll. In fact, evidence indicates that the 65-million-dollar industry will cease to exist within this century. With sap seekers in New Hampshire unable to produce any Grade-A syrup this season, others reporting significantly less sweet syrup, and prices already on the rise, the end may come sooner than expected.

But Radlo Foods has perhaps offered the best response yet. In addition to breaking its ties with Quality Egg, the corporation has pledged to phase out battery cages within the next 10 years. Animal rights organizations hope that other industry leaders follow suit in an effort to help end the abysmal abuse against these innocent animals.

ALARM OVER FOOD SAFETY BILL,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/alarm-over-food-safety-bill,"APRIL 6, 2009","Frantic emails and headlines have been flying around the past few days, extolling the dangers of the HR 875 bill submitted to the House for consideration. It will outlaw organic farming! It will make storing heirloom seeds illegal! As it turns out, neither of these assertions is true. The Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009, intended to prevent future large-scale food safety problems, does not even explicitly mention organic farming. Several organizations, including Slow Food USA and Food and Water Watch, recommend that people remain calm. They simply take issue with the fact that the bill caters to large-scale suppliers, and urge concerned foodies to tell their Congress members that the welfare of smaller organic and sustainable businesses matters when creating new legislation. So the verdict, at least for the time being, is: don’t panic, you can still go organic. "

But if they live with one, it may very well be true. In a recent study conducted at Bath Spa University in the UK, scientists asked 70 participants to match photos of dog-guardians to one of three possible breeds: Labrador, poodle, or Staffordshire bull terrier. Statistically, they should have guessed correctly 33 percent of the time, but participants made the correct match more than 50 percent of the time. The findings suggest that participants used appearances to assess how to pair a pooch to a person. So, take a look in the mirror, wrinkle your nose, stick out your tongue, and give your best bark. You may be surprised by how much you resemble your pup! "
BRONZE MEDALIST POSES FOR PETA,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/bronze-medalist-poses-for-peta,"APRIL 5, 2009","One of the most tried and true excuses for continuing to eat meat is that going veg will “interfere with athletic performance,” but now “excuse”-itarians will have to come up with something better. Sushil Kumar, an Indian athlete who won a bronze medal in Beijing, has agreed to pose for PETA and promote vegetarianism in his home country. The ads feature Kumar showing off his optimal physical physique along with the tagline “Wrestling with health problems?

ETHICAL INVESTING,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/ethical-investing,"APRIL 4, 2009","While the economic debacle that has caused rampant home foreclosures and job losses for the last few months continues to play out, the priority of the new administration is getting the economy under control. According to the “buy low, sell high” adage, if you’ve managed to stay afloat during these trying months, now might be a good time to start looking over your investment options. As a vegetarian, you’re used to going the extra mile to make sure that your consumer purchases don’t support businesses or industries that harm animals. Now you want to start planning for your fiscal future, and are prepared to put those same efforts into practice as a novice investor. However, if you think being veg in a society that exploits animals is hard, just try keeping your money clean in the complex world of financial investing. The reality is that there simply aren’t enough publicly held vegan companies (i.e., those that don’t engage in animal exploitation of any kind) to comprise a suitably diversified portfolio. Most purely vegan companies are small and privately held, requiring venture capital investments that are typically high-risk. Nearly all publicly held companies that make vegetarian goods also market products made from animals, so giving them money promotes practices that most vegetarians would consider unethical. So what’s a veggie investor to do? One solution is to consult a professional financial advisor who understands what vegetarians want an investment strategy. Brad Pappas, founder of Rocky Mountain Humane Investing is one such expert, having specialized in “cruelty-free investing” for more than a decade. “I have a lot of experience creating customized portfolios that reflect my clients? compassionate values,” says Pappas. “I believe strongly in never pressuring people to invest in something that neglects their moral stance.” Timothy Smith, president of the Social Investment Forum, the SRI industry’s trade association, urges veggie investors to use the power of shareholder advocacy to improve corporations’ animal husbandry practices. “Though animal welfare is still a relatively minor issue on the shareholder action agenda,” notes Smith, “I’ve seen a number of meaningful changes in company practices in recent years.” While some vegetarians may be uncomfortable with such minor concessions in how animals are treated, they may be necessary to bringing a more compassionate world into being. Still looking to dip your toe into the somewhat tepid stock market? A good investment for beginners, mutual funds offer instant diversification and require a relatively small minimum financial outlay.

CRUSTACEANS FEEL PAIN,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/crustaceans-feel-pain,"APRIL 4, 2009","Giving new meaning to the word “crabby,” scientists at Queen’s University in Belfast have been experimenting with hermit crabs’ response to pain. It has been widely believed that crustaceans can’t feel pain in the same way other animals experience the sensation, but this study has scientists convinced that’s not the case. Not only do crabs try to remove themselves from painful situations, but they also appear to retain memories of them. There are currently very few laws protecting the rights of crustaceans, which is why boiling them alive is a common practice. The scientists involved in this study are hoping they can use the results to encourage more humane treatment of our hard-shelled friends. "
TOP VEGAN ATHLETES,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/top-vegan-athletes,"APRIL 4, 2009","Spring is the season of love, flowers, lambs, and an abundance of colorful vegetables. What more could happy, healthy herbivores hope for, right? Well, maybe it’s also that time of year when we all start taking our workouts just a little bit more seriously, since the specter of summertime shorts, skirts, and swimsuits is starting to linger. Whether you’re a longtime, die-hard athlete or just taking your first steps off the couch, find inspiration in these three incredible, veg-powered, professional athletes. Mac Danzig
Sport: Mixed Martial Arts, Ultimate Fighting Championship Fighter
Diet: Vegan since 2004
Favorite Protein Source: “For supplemental protein, I like brown-rice protein, but my favorite protein-rich food is grilled portabello mushrooms.”
Story: Danzig is a fighter of the highest caliber. With more than 20 professional fights under his belt, he triumphed on the sixth season of UFC’s “The Ultimate Fighter.” How does he reconcile his peaceful eating habits with a career based on beating people up? “I don’t really view my career as being ‘violent.’ It’s a refined, sanctioned sport and I treat it as such. Everyone who competes makes the free-willed decision to compete and has the choice to submit during the fight, which is actually respected. I feel the term ‘violence’ involves a victim, and in the sport of MMA, there aren’t any victims, every fighter chooses to compete.” Maureen Shea
Sport: Boxing
Diet: Vegan since 2007
Favorite Protein Source: “Robert Ferguson’s protein muffins.” Though many of Ferguson’s recipes aren’t vegan, Shea is a substitutions whiz. For these muffins, ground flax are used in place of eggs.
Story: Often referred to as “The Real Million Dollar Baby,” Shea was Hilary Swank’s training partner for her Oscar-winning role. The 27-year-old fighter has everything going for her: the fame of a star sparring partner, a legendary trainer in Hector Roca, and, of course, a healthy, vegan diet to keep her going. “[Being vegan] has enhanced my athletic performance. I am stronger mentally, physically, and spiritually,” she says. With a record of 13-1, that’s 13 wins and one loss, Shea’s performance speaks for itself. Tim VanOrden
Sport: Marathon and mountain-trail running, and snowshoeing
Diet: Raw vegan since 2005
Favorite Protein Source: “You don’t need protein, you need amino acids. Fresh fruits and veggies are loaded with amino acids, so I cut out the middleman.”
Story: When Tim VanOrden (above photo) decided to go raw, he found himself with more energy than he knew what to do with. “(Being raw) created the athletic inspiration. I had all this extra energy,” he says. “I’m a vegan and a raw foodist first, and I’m an athlete to prove a point.” VanOrden, who didn’t become a competitive athlete until the age of 38, credits his raw diet with the repair of sports injuries from his high-school years and the disappearance of his athletics-induced asthma.

SAN FRANCISCO’S BAN ON FOIE GRAS,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/san-franciscos-ban-on-foie-gras,"APRIL 4, 2009","Back in September 2004, Governor Schwarzenegger signed into law a bill that bans the production and sale of foie gras in California, which will take effect in 2012, making the Golden State the first to enact such a ban. In typical San Franciscan style, District 5 Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi added to the already-victorious bill by putting forth legislation that would applaud restaurants that voluntarily remove the “delicacy” from their menus before the phase-out deadline. Shortly before the resolution was unanimously approved on March 24, there was a little local squawking about whether or not Mayor Gavin Newsom would favor the move, since restaurants owned by PlumpJack Group—of which he is the founder and sister Hilary is the president—were still serving foie gras. Thankfully, in a decision lauded by organizations such as The Humane Society of the United States, the PlumpJack Group has decided to forego the foie gras. Of course, the fewer restaurants serving foie gras, the fewer ducks and geese will suffer the force-feeding methods used to overextend their livers. Mark Caro, the Chicago Tribune entertainment reporter who brought nationwide attention to the issue of foie gras by reporting that chef Charlie Trotter was taking it off his menus, recently released his first book, The Foie Gras Wars. In researching the book, Caro spoke not only with chefs on both sides of the foie-gras fence, but with producers of foie gras, as well as animal activists, including Gene Baur of Farm Sanctuary. On his predictions of the 2012 ban going into effect, Caro says, “I wouldn’t be surprised to see another foie-gras battle erupt in California as supporters of the product try to get the ban repealed before it takes effect; the San Francisco resolution could be read as a preemptive strike against such a move. If the ban does take effect as scheduled, the country will lose one of its three foie-gras farms with national distribution, Sonoma Foie Gras, as well as a huge market for its consumption, California. The publicity over the ban also might put heat on the remaining foie-gras producers and give momentum to those who would ban foie gras elsewhere.” Caro raises the point that anyone who eats animal products is complicit in a certain degree of animal suffering, regardless of whether that animal is an egg-laying chicken confined in a battery cage, a cow separated from her newborn calf for her milk, or a duck who is routinely force-fed. He says, “There seems to be a growing gray area as people try to weigh foie-gras production against that of foods they eat every day without thinking about [the animals]. I think such overall consciousness is increasing, and the impact ultimately will be farther reaching than how people feel about fat duck livers.” Animal activists can hope that Caro is right, and that once more consumers become aware of the inherent cruelty of consuming animal-derived products, they’ll also choose a veg lifestyle.

ECO-FRIENDLY OBAMA,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/eco-friendly-obama,"APRIL 3, 2009","Obama has already taken bold environmental initiatives to protect endangered wilderness, prevent mountaintop mining, and raise the requirement for motor vehicle efficiency. Following these first few footsteps, he made a valiant vow to bring the US to the forefront of the international battle against global warming. His words are backed by a bill and budget already proposed by Congress, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent within the next 10 years. Sound ambitious? The president thinks so, too. But with recent reports suggesting complete arctic defrost may occur within the next 30 years, we don’t have much more time to sit around twiddling our thumbs. Obama plans to begin with his own home, painting the White House green with myriad eco-friendly improvements. "
MFA EXPOSES EGG CRUELTY,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/mfa-exposes-egg-cruelty,"APRIL 2, 2009","Just in time for Easter, Mercy for Animals (MFA) has uncovered a sad and startling situation behind the barn doors of New England’s biggest egg farm. Inside the factory—owned and operated by Quality Egg—MFA filmed and photographed shocking footage of rotting carcasses still laying eggs for human consumption, sick and suffering birds, atrocious abuse and maltreatment, and inconceivably cramped living conditions. State officials responded to the insider evidence by raiding the farm armed with a search warrant backed by Maine’s animal cruelty laws. While we’re hoping that the truth will set these innocent birds free, their fate ultimately rests in the hands of demand. So, next time you’re deciding between scrambled and sunny-side up, have some compassion and opt for neither. And before you dip, dye, and decorate your Easter eggs this year, consider the cruel conditions from which they may have come. "
STELLA MCCARTNEY HONORED,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/stella-mccartney-honored,"APRIL 2, 2009","As she struts down the red carpet posing for pictures, all eyes are on Stella. Well, more specifically on her skin-tight, thigh-high boots. They’re definitely not lacking sex appeal, but what they are lacking is leather—just like all of her designs. Stella’s commitment to cruelty-free fashion is one of the reasons why she—along with Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav—was honored at the Natural Resources Defense Council’s “Forces for Nature” benefit on Monday, March 30. This annual affair recognizes industry leaders committed to environmental stewardship, and the event itself is as green as they come. The menu is locally sourced and meat-free, and the daffodils used as centerpieces will later be planted in New York City. The decision to wear sexy boots, though, is left to the discretion of the guests. "
GMO BEETS ENTER MARKET,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/gmo-beets-enter-market,"APRIL 1, 2009","President Obama dislikes beets so much that he vetoed them from the White House garden. But now he—and every other American—has even better reason to push this vegetable to the edge of the plate. In response to a lawsuit filed by the Center for Food Safety and Earthjustice, the Obama administration upheld Bush’s decision to approve Monsanto’s genetically modified sugarbeets. These “Roundup Ready” herbicide-resistant roots were harvested for the first time last fall, despite considerable opposition, and have already entered the food supply—mostly in the form of sugar. The scientific community and sugar junkies aren’t the only ones scared; more than 70 food manufacturers have already joined the Non-Genetically Modified Beet Sugar Registry, agreeing not to market modified beet sugar.

BABY CHICKS SHOW OFF SMARTS,https://vegnews.com/2009/4/baby-chicks-show-off-smarts,"APRIL 1, 2009","If someone calls you a “birdbrain,” you can now consider it a compliment, since baby chicks display math skills that surpass those of most human newborns. At the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences in Trento, Italy, chicks were raised with five yellow toy balls. The chicks soon became socially attached to the toy balls and would even make distress calls if their “companions” were removed from sight. In a later stage of the study, the chicks had to keep track of the number of balls using addition and subtraction. Their behavior demonstrated that they could spontaneously choose the larger group. Experiments have only tested chicks’ mental prowess up to the number five, but researchers speculate they might be able to handle arithmetic up to ten, which would far exceed human newborns’ ability to cope with only three.

As an outspoken vegetarian and eco-activist, Anderson has admitted on several occasions that she actually prefers to be in the nude—and she’s got the barely clad PETA posters to prove it!

So far this year, the latter seems to be the case more often than not. Just when we thought we may be nearing the end of the peanut scare, another nut has claimed the salmonella spotlight. Although authorities have yet to legitimize the link, Central California-based Setton Pistachio, the second largest US pistachio processor, has already shut down its plant and recalled more than two million pounds of product. The allegedly tainted nuts have been sold in 31 states since being shipped last fall. Assistant commissioner for food safety Dr. David Acheson recommends that consumers avoid buying pistachios and postpone eating products already purchased. Walnuts, pecans, or almonds, anyone? "

Toyota plans to release the latest version of its man-made masterpiece—bigger, faster, and more efficient than its predecessors—in May. The Japanese car company first launched its dual design in 2000, and has dominated the hybrid category ever since. The 2010 update will average 50 miles per gallon, and range in price depending on whether you go with the stripped down style or fully loaded luxury version. With well over one million Prius vehicles currently on the road, and eight of ten Prius drivers satisfied with their purchase, hopes are high for round three. "

This small but significant cadre of officers has evolved over time from “game protectors” to “eco-police,” though their duties still include making the rounds in seafood markets to ensure that undersize fish (often a symptom of illegal fishing) aren’t being sold, and health conditions are being honored. It’s a tough job, but we’re glad it’s being done. "

They just need to specify what kind of milk they’d like their children to be drinking. Based on a new study, your best bet is soy. The journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention reported that adults who consumed soy at least once a week when they were children were 60 percent less likely to develop breast cancer. Didn’t get started on soy until later in life? Not a problem! Even adults who consume soy regularly are significantly less likely to get cancer. So go ahead and enjoy some soy.

INTERVIEW WITH VEG ARTIST GRETCHEN RYAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/interview-with-veg-artist-gretchen-ryan,"MARCH 28, 2009","If you wouldn’t normally give pageant girls a second thought, you’ve clearly never seen the haunting work of painter and animal-advocate Gretchen Ryan. The strangely beautiful girls that Ryan brings to life in her exhibition, “Little Pretty,” are part child, part doll, and, sometimes, part (non-human) animal. On the eve of her New York City opening, the 33-year-old, Los Angeles-based artist chatted with VN. VegNews: Why choose pageant girls as your subjects?
GR: The portraits of children began with me wanting to paint myself when I was a child. At the time I was newly disabled—using a wheelchair after a car accident as a teenager—and pretty much assimilated to the situation by getting drunk. I thought a lot about the time when I was perfect, the way we are when we’re new. I began these images of my child-self, incorporating the sense of doom that I really should have had the whole time. I ran out of photographs of myself to reference early on and found models, stand-ins for my own experience, in the children of friends. But I really didn’t have many children in my life and I wanted models I could use more formally. The pageants were such a treasure in that the girls’ parents have star aspirations for them and have trained them to be in front of a camera. The strange vision of babies in makeup and thousand-dollar dresses is so unnatural but what appeals to me is finding a real moment, the child in the doll. Pageants are a condensed, intensified version of what all girls and women go through; being judged and valued for our beauty or lack thereof. These are portraits of individual girls who are more perfect than they will ever be yet, thankfully, have no idea what that means and won’t until it is gone. They are girls who will become women, a transition fraught with peril. VN: You’re very involved with animal rights. Do you foresee including more animals in your art in the future?
GR: Yes, definitely. It is a difficult subject to incorporate into art, I feel, or to convey an animal-rights message. The images that are the strongest for the animals are the photos—especially documentary footage—of how they are treated. It’s just too horrible to believe without seeing it yourself. VN: How do you combine your roles as artist and activist?
GR: I volunteer at Animal Acres and take time out of painting to give tours to children there, and I take pictures of the animals to use in my work. I also tell everyone who will listen about veganism, and give Skinny Bitch to all the women I work with. Of course, all the food at my opening will be vegan. The art world and the animal-rights world are quite separate but being an activist for the animals is a huge part of who I am, so it seeps into everything I do and all my relationships. “Little Pretty” opens April 3 at Fred Torres Collaborations in New York, NY, and will be on view through May 13.

CARDBOARD FURNITURE,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/cardboard-furniture,"MARCH 25, 2009","Reduce. Reuse. Recycle. Three words one company has made a mainstay of its mission statement—along with its desks, tables, and stairs. Michael Jansen, founder of the Amsterdam-based advertising agency named Nothing, seems to be on to something. He recently converted his concept of creating an entire office from cardboard into 3-D reality, giving whole new meaning to the term “board meeting.” What’s even more amazing? No glue, screw, or nail was used. In fact, Nothing whittled 500 square meters of cardboard down to 1500 separate interlocking pieces to construct its office furniture. With 90 percent of all US products shipped in boxes, cardboard is certainly in no short supply here in the States. While constructing your next conference room with cardboard may seem a bit daunting, why not start with a chair and build your way up from there! "

MEAT INCREASES EARLY DEATH,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/meat-increases-early-death,"MARCH 24, 2009","If you thought consuming a diet consisting of red meat only upped your odds for clogged arteries, malignant cancers, and mad cow disease, here’s one more health malady to mark on your list: death. In the first large study of its kind, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, researchers found that regularly eating pork and beef increased participants’ overall risk for premature death. The National Cancer Institute surveyed more than 500,000 middle-aged and elderly Americans, discovering that those who consumed four ounces of red meat per day were more than 30 percent more likely to die during the course of the ten-year study. If that’s not scary enough, consider the fact that red meat intake also increases water shortages, pollution, energy expenditure, and greenhouse gas emissions—and put down your meat-filled fork while you‘re at it.

INTERVIEW WITH DONNY MOSS OF BLINDERS,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/interview-with-donny-moss-of-blinders,"MARCH 23, 2009","The idyllic image of horses clip-clopping through Central Park is often fodder for romantic comedies and has even been used in posters promoting tourism in New York City. But look a little closer and it’s easy to see that these horses’ lives are far from the fantasy. Often overworked, abused, and traumatized by the frenetic conditions of life in the Big Apple, carriage horses lead a painful and joyless existence. Donny Moss, an animal-loving New Yorker, got tired of turning a blind eye and decided to do something about it. His 50-minute Genesis Award-nominated film, Blinders, delves into the often overlooked, but heartbreaking lives of Central Park carriage horses. VN catches up with Donny before the ceremony to learn more about his first foray into filmmaking. VegNews: Where did the idea for Blinders come from?
Donny Moss: I had been walking by the horse-drawn carriages along Central Park South for 20 years, and the sight of the carriage horses made me uncomfortable, but I sort of turned the other way and kept going. And then I heard about this horrible accident where a horse spooked and ran along 9th Avenue into traffic and got killed. Then I saw protesters in the street and I thought this would be a really interesting subject for a documentary. VN: What were some of the challenges and rewards of making this film?
DM: Getting a movie that people perceive to be about animal rights shown is very difficult, because people don’t want to watch animals suffering. One of the best things for me is when non-animal people have come to see Blinders, they have said that this forced them, for the first time, to consider humane treatment of animals. So I think people will walk out of this movie thinking about animals, especially animals in entertainment, in a different light. VN: Congratulations on your Genesis Award nomination! Tell us a little bit about this.
DM: I submitted Blinders for a Genesis award, knowing that the other people submitting applications would be CNN and PBS and National Geographic—so you can imagine how excited I was when I received the letter saying that I had been nominated in the TV documentary category. I haven’t been before and I’m just thrilled to be able to go. Even if Blinders doesn’t win, this is a tremendous honor and it also helps raise awareness of the issue. VN: Tell us a little bit about Alec Baldwin’s involvement with the film.
DM: He’s been fighting on behalf of the carriage horses since at least the late ‘80s, if not earlier, and he has appeared at City Hall and testified, which is why I gave him the DVD, with the hope that he would be amenable to a screening, and sure enough he said he would do it. He couldn’t have been any more gracious and his heart’s just in the right place. VN: How can people obtain copies of the film? And what can they do to help?
DM: Copies are $15 from our website. There’s also a “What You Can Do” section, which gives instructions on how to send a letter to the mayor or the city council speaker, or if you’re a New York City resident, how to contact your City Council Member. VN: Are you vegan?
DM: I am. As I was making the movie my awareness of animal suffering—not just for entertainment, but in the clothing industry and in the food industry—was growing as I was starting to be exposed to more people and other issues. I’ve decided to abstain from consuming animals, in a large part as a result of making this movie and being exposed to the plight of animals. "
THREE GREAT ECO-FRIENDLY CITIES TO VISIT AND ENJOY,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/three-great-eco-friendly-cities-to-visit-and-enjoy,"MARCH 23, 2009","Think living green means retiring to a shack in the woods and disconnecting from society? Think again. These three eco-friendly, urban hot spots meld environmentalism, city living, and a hope for a greener future. Chicago
Mayor Richard Daley is ambitious, powerful, competitive and, lucky for Chicagoans, green. He wants Chicago to be known as the greenest city in America, and seems unstoppable when it comes to planting trees—half a million since 1989—to beautify the city and provide much-needed oxygen and shade. He’s on a roll with greening city rooftops (two and a half million square feet) to conserve energy, filter rainwater, and to buffer intense summertime heat. “He leads by example,” says Peter Nicholson, executive director of Foresight Design Initiative in Chicago, of Daley. “He’s able to motivate and inspire people to evolve better by taking intentional action—and he rides a bike.” Daley’s Environmental Action Agenda replaced 130 city vehicles with hybrids and installed 10,000 bike racks around the city, as cycling has become one of the most common methods of transportation, along with Chicago’s well-traveled transit system. Chicago is a diverse city and, according to Nicholson, it’s the diversity of the efforts under way that sets Chicago apart as a green model. “There is no part of the city that has been left untouched by the greening efforts,” he says. Now, if we could just get that foie-gras ban reinstated? Reykjavik
Not only do the numerous hot springs running beneath the world’s northernmost capital (shown in photo above) provide its denizens with a place to soak and relax, but these geothermal springs also provide almost all of Reykjavik’s heat and water. Located on what geologists call a “hotspot” with a high concentration of volcanoes, Iceland gets 70 percent of its energy from renewable resources like springs and waterfalls. In direct contrast to its name, which means “Smokey Bay,” Reykjavik is now known as the world’s least-polluted capital. As a healthy bonus for its low dependence on oil, the skies over the city are crystal clear. And because geothermal energy is so inexpensive and clean, residents enjoy the wintertime luxury of heated sidewalks. Reykjavik has green ambitions of becoming the world’s first hydrogen city by 2050, weaning itself off fossil fuels entirely over the next 40 years, converting cars, trucks, buses, and ships to run clean and quiet, opening more and more hydrogen “gas” stations. In theory, the only oil being burned in all of Iceland will be on planes landing from other countries. Kathmandu
Perhaps the most surprising city in this trio is the medieval city of Kathmandu, famous for its centuries-old architecture, rich history, fascinating culture, and stunning views of the Himalayas. Recognized and protected by UNESCO as a world heritage site, Kathmandu is taking the stage—if tentatively—as an emerging green city. The Nepalese capital recently hosted an international conference called “Ecocity: The Time to Act is Now,” where speakers in roundtable discussions voiced concerns over smog and sewage problems, and offered solutions to jump-start a revitalization of the city with the environment and quality of living as top priorities. With its narrow streets, small squares, and growing population, the city is becoming increasingly hostile to the car—a reality Register believes could be the catalyst for the paradigm shift necessary to eliminate the city’s congestion and pollution problems. Residents of Kathmandu have long known how to harness the power of the sun, and utilize their rooftops as green living spaces. Solar water heaters are purposefully placed on rooftops, where gardens flourish and laundry dries in the sun and the breeze. "

Recent bird watchers have witnessed the recovery of the bald eagle and peregrine falcons following the ban of the chemical DDT, and wetland bird populations have grown since 1968. But for the most part, things are lookin’ gloomy, so if you own a pair of binoculars, you may want to dig them out and point your eyes toward the skies! "

Before answering, consider this: a recent study at the University of Pittsburgh examined the relationship between attitude and health. People with an optimistic outlook were 14 percent less likely to die for any reason, 23 percent less likely to die from cancer, and 30 percent less likely to die from heart disease over an eight-year period. In order to determine test subjects’ outlook on life, researchers administered a survey consisting of questions like the one at the beginning of this paragraph. If you answered affirmatively, consider spending a few minutes every day thinking about things in a positive light; you’ll be rewarded immediately—and for years to come! "
JCP GOES FUR-FREE,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/jcp-goes-fur-free,"MARCH 17, 2009","Rather than make the fur fly after the Humane Society called them out on a mislabeling mishap, JCPenney has responded by shedding it altogether. With more than 1,000 stores in 49 states, the retailer has become the first major department store to take such initiative, joining a growing list of 130+ other fur-free stores. Although the company has yet to make a formal announcement, its vice president, Robert Hood, confirmed the decision in a recent letter to the Humane Society. Founded on James Cash Penney’s philosophy of doing what is “right and just,” the company has long been a champion of environmental, social, and ethical initiatives. Let’s hope other department stores follow their honorable lead and let the original owners keep their fur. "
MILLS’ MENU MAKEOVER,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/mills-menu-makeover,"MARCH 16, 2009","It’s something that most vegetarians fantasize about from time to time, but few actually follow through with. Heather Mills, however, is a clear exception. This animal-rights activist and devoted vegan has decided to live the dream by buying one of her favorite seaside restaurants in East Sussex, England. So where does the vegan part come in? She’s taking seafood—and all other surf ‘n’ turf selections—off the menu. This is not the first time Mills has donned a chef’s hat, though. She hosted a healthy cook-a-thon for families in the Bronx this past January as part of her efforts to promote the Hunts Point Alliance for Children. Looks like no matter what side of the Atlantic she’s on, Mills is making big waves—and great food—in the veg world. "
DOWNED COWS UNFIT FOR FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/downed-cows-unfit-for-food,"MARCH 16, 2009","Animal advocates, food-safety supporters—and just about every other American—had good reason to celebrate on Saturday, as President Barack Obama and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack officially banned the practice of slaughtering downed cattle for human consumption. This measure put an end to the abuse of downed cows and marked the start of a safer food supply. With 15 of the 19 reported US cases of mad cow disease related to downed animal consumption, it is a wonder why such a simple step took so long. We don’t mean to point fingers or beat around the Bush, but figure you can probably make a good guess. While it’d be great to see Obama stop factory farming and cattle slaughtering altogether, it certainly seems like he’s off to a promising start. And it’s always nice when carnivores and herbivores can find something to agree upon! "
WAIST SIZE AFFECTS LUNG HEALTH,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/waist-size-affects-lung-health,"MARCH 15, 2009","If the fast-approaching swimsuit season isn’t motivation enough, here’s one more reason to whittle down your waistline. A recent study in France, which considered more than 120,000 people’s waist sizes in relation to their overall health, has discovered a conclusive correlation between the size of your middle and your lungs’ ability to do their job. The danger zone begins when the circumference of your waist tops 35 inches if you’re a woman, and 40 inches if you’re a man. This research builds upon previous findings, which established a connection between waist size and increased risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. All of the sudden, a few sit-ups doesn’t sound like such a bad idea!   "

PETA’S SLAUGHTERHOUSE PURCHASE,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/petas-slaughterhouse-purchase,"MARCH 14, 2009","In what may at first be considered one of PETA’s more peculiar proposals, the animal-rights organization has offered to crack open its own piggy bank to purchase Pilgrim’s Pride slaughterhouse. And do what with it, you may ask? Why, transform it into a chicken empathy museum, of course! In response to Louisiana Governor Jindal’s efforts to save the company and 1,300 jobs from economic slaughter, PETA recently stepped in with this brilliant idea. Will Farmerville, La. soon offer animal empathy education in lieu of fried wings and thighs? Only time will tell, but if you’re currently unemployed, be sure to keep your eye out for an ad seeking compassionate curators … "
HOW TO KNOW WHICH BUSINESSES TO SUPPORT,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/how-to-know-which-businesses-to-support,"MARCH 14, 2009","It seems these days like every company wants to be seen as “green,” but how can consumers and investors distinguish between businesses that are doing actual good from corporate poseurs with clever packaging and PR? Berwyn, Penn.-based non-profit B Lab offers a solution: a comprehensive B (Beneficial) Corporation certification program that measures companies’ impact on society, the environment, and a host of other real-world criteria. A relatively recent arrival on the business scene, the B Corporation is a sort of hybrid of the for-profit and non-profit sectors. The concept’s originators hope this new designation will give companies incentive to make their highest values central to how they do business, and transform commerce into a driving force for progressive social change. High-powered entrepreneurs Jay Coen Gilbert, Bart Houlahan, and Andrew Kassoy co-founded B Lab in 2006 because they noticed exponential market growth in self-proclaimed “socially responsible” enterprises, but no rules to ensure that terms like “green” and “sustainable” would remain meaningful and not be specious marketing claims. Their innovative B Ratings System, designed in an open-source format with input from more than 600 business experts in diverse fields, may help fill that gap. B Lab also offers tools and resources to foster businesses’ social and environmental evolution. Consisting of a questionnaire weighted differently for the manufacturing, distribution, and service industries, B Lab’s survey rates companies based on everything from environmental practices and labor relations to philanthropic contributions, then translates the results into a numerical tally. The B Ratings System is flexible enough to credit companies for creating benefit in a variety of different ways. For instance, companies that produce vegetarian goods would earn points for using production methods that do not harm animals, and for making products that are healthier for people and the environment. Among the 160 companies certified so far, some B Corporations, such as Seventh Generation and Method, are also certified by the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics’ Leaping Bunny Program. Having more animal-friendly criteria included in the rating system would make it easier for vegetarian companies to become certified as B Corporations, and for more mainstream companies to adopt humane practices. The potential to propel cruelty-free practices into standard operating procedures is important to many vegetarians, who view this as the first step toward creating a truly humane society. B Corporations can also support vegetarian and animal-protection advocacy by donating a portion of their profits to non-profits—namely those that promote causes they believe in. Some, like office-supplies company Give Something Back, devote more than half of their profits to charitable causes, resulting in stellar B Ratings. Others—like Untours travel and Pura Vida fair-trade coffee—even create their own foundations, financed by profits that function as a non-profit arm of the company. Such “for-purpose” businesses have the potential to attract capital beyond the wildest dreams of non-profits, and could allow veg entrepreneurs to found advocacy organizations or animal sanctuaries that wouldn’t be dependent on fundraising for their operation. After passing the ratings test, companies have to do one more thing before graduating to B Corporation status: they must amend their corporate governing charters to legally institutionalize the companies’ commitment to serving not only the interests of shareholders, but all stakeholders—including employees, the community, and the environment. That means that the primary motivating factor behind corporate decision-making is not the value of company stock, but the value the company could add to the world. B Lab’s founders hope to make their certification the gold standard for socially and environmentally responsible companies. "
BALI SLAUGHTERS WILD DOGS,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/bali-slaughters-wild-dogs,"MARCH 13, 2009","When you think of Bali you probably imagine a tropical island paradise, right? Well, that’s certainly not the case for its canine population. Recent rabies-related fatalities have prompted authorities to point their fingers at the island’s wild dog population. Their solution? Cruel and unnecessary mass slaughter using a lethal injection of strychnine. What’s worse is that wild dogs aren’t the only ones suffering. Since the majority of Bali’s domesticated pups roam freely, animal companions are also in danger. Experts at the World Health Organization assert that vaccination and education are the keys to combating rabies; not murder. Help put an end to this inhumane campaign by signing an online petition from the World Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. "
OBAMA’S HEALTHY KITCHEN,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/obamas-healthy-kitchen,"MARCH 12, 2009","Much ado has been made about her toned physique, but Michelle Obama’s interest in health is about more than looking good in a sleeveless dress. In a rare glimpse behind the White House kitchen doors, she spoke on the importance of using fresh fruits and vegetables, how she’s banned boxed juices and sugary snacks from the pantry, and why she loves a (gasp) vegan recipe for creamed spinach sans cream! Admittedly, this is not her daughters’ favorite, but we have to applaud her for teaching her children early on to appreciate the taste of fresh and local produce. Here’s to a lean and green First Family! "

If a free day with Mickey doesn’t put a smile on your face, there’s more good news coming. Disney has committed to cutting carbon emissions all the way down to zero. And we’re not just talking about Disney’s theme parks; the multi-billion-dollar corporation will also be curbing carbon in its offices, retail stores, and cruise lines. Although no official deadline has been set, the company plans to look toward alternative energy sources and clean electricity suppliers in order to halve its current output by 2012. Believe it or not, the “happiest place on earth” just got a little happier! "

As author of The Green Collar Economy, a Time magazine 2008 Environmental Hero, and founding president of Green For All, this Obama appointee can only mean good things for this little planet we call Earth.

Yes, the Beehive State came out on top in a recent poll conducted by Gallup, Healthways, and America’s Health Insurance Plans. Hawaii and Wyoming were runner-ups with their genuine grins and positive outlook on life. West Virginia, Kentucky, and Mississippi were at the other end of the spectrum, earning the lowest happiness ratings in the nation. The survey, completed by 350,000 Americans, based its ratings on factors such as eating habits, exercise routine, and access to basic necessities. Not satisfied with your state’s score? The survey’s set to be repeated annually for the next quarter-century, so you have plenty of chances to up your smile stats. "

In an effort to go green, this multi-million dollar food-service company is reducing its carbon footprint, one cheeseburger at a time. A widely publicized 2006 UN report, which documented the effects of factory farming on the environment, propelled this purveyor of cafeteria fare to pare down the use of meat and dairy by 25 percent. In another nod to the veg lifestyle, the organization will continue to serve local produce during “Low Carbon Diet Days” held regularly at campuses across the nation. "

On the 220-acre Isle of Thanet, the company is using greenhouse-like conditions to produce crops that taste, smell, and look like traditional farm-fresh fruits and veggies, allowing consumers to enjoy locally grown produce year-round. However, these science-manipulated plants grow without one considerable component: soil. Instead, they thrive in a closely-monitored, temperature-controlled environment in which they are drip-fed nutrient-enriched water. Sound like something out of the 21st century? Well, welcome to it. We’ll be watching closely to determine if this futuristic food is safe and healthy. "
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/environmental-protection,"MARCH 8, 2009","Before building a new highway or dam, should agencies like the Department of Transportation consult scientists about the project’s possible impact on the local ecosystem? If your answer is yes, you’re in good company. In an effort to overturn one of the Bush administration’s midnight-hour maneuvers, President Obama signed a memorandum to help reinstate the Endangered Species Act. Obama is asking agencies responsible for large-scale construction projects to speak with scientists and determine what effects their project may have on local threatened wildlife. This gesture has already garnered praise from organizations such as the Sierra Club who applauded Obama’s efforts to respect natural resources. "
VEGNEWS INTERVIEWS VEGAN ROCKERS PROPAGANDHI,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/vegnews-interviews-vegan-rockers-propagandhi,"MARCH 8, 2009","Subtlety has never been its strong suit, but Propagandhi has always been a leader of the punk/agit-prop pack. The Winnipeg-based band’s new album, Supporting Caste—out March 10—is set to be its best yet. And with pre-release downloads directing donations to the band’s favorite charities—Partners in Health, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, and PETA2—it’s hard not to get at least a minor case of the warm and fuzzies. Bassist Todd “The Rod” Kowalski takes time off from touring to give VN the scoop. VegNews: Tell us about your new album. What should everyone know about it?
Todd “the Rod” Kowalski: We worked really, really hard on the songs, our playing, and the lyrics. We got a great painting from an artist named Kent Monkman for the cover art. I drew a picture for the inside. This is for sure our best record. A labor of love. VN: How has your music evolved over time?
TK: We practice pretty hard so our music is getting better and closer to what we are hoping to achieve. As always we’re still on the journey. VN: I read an interview with you just after the 2001 election and your outlook of the world was pretty bleak. How do you feel about Obama’s presidency? What does it mean for the rest of the world?
TK: I’m sure it’s a step forward for the world but certainly Barack will not be the savior people think he will be. I think it’s dangerous to idolize politicians and support them full steam ahead without question. I agree with the spirit that got him elected, but he’s already surrounded himself with questionable people and has said some things that show a sad foreshadow of future policies. VN: What is your relationship like with your fans?
TK: Our relationship with the fans is pretty good. We do our best to respond to our emails and letters. We always try to be nice and take time for people, even the drunk kids stinking into our faces. We do get a lot of people who give us some credit for helping them out a bit, and we appreciate it a lot. The fans are ready to rock pretty much anywhere we go. I think the fans appreciate how much we try to prepare for the shows and how much we’re putting into each show. We always do the best we can. VN: You’ve been giving free downloads of your songs to fans who donate to selected charities. Tell us more about this.
TK: We try our best to support people working for a better world and do what we can to generate interest in them. This time it was Partners In Health, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, and PETA2. We figured it would be a good thing to do with our new songs, rather than just slap them up on our website or something. It’s been going really well. People have been into the idea and going with it. We might do something like this again in the future. VN: We’d like to hear about your experience as vegans—both on the road and at home.
TK: When we’re on tour we end up going to a lot of vegan restaurants and a lot of Thai restaurants. We went to an unbelievable Thai restaurant called Peace Harmony in Sydney, Australia two days ago. We went there four times in two days! When I’m at home I usually cook my own food and every once in a while go to Merkato, my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Winnipeg. Check out Propagandhi:

In a new UK study, children’s TV watching is now linked to incidence of asthma. Anything upwards of two hours a day doubled children’s risk of developing this condition. While TV is not directly responsible, it is a symptom of a sedentary lifestyle, and hours spent in front of the tube could be better spent being active. Some scientists believe that children who abstain from physical activity may not be breathing deeply enough, so their airways are not sufficiently stretched, making asthma more of a threat. Moms everywhere can breathe a sigh of relief, as you have yet another reason to hide the remote. "

In a study funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, nearly 200 children received their usual lunches, only this time their produce came with creative names such as “x-ray vision carrots”, “power peas”, and “dinosaur broccoli trees”. Sound like fun? The four-year-olds thought so, too. In fact, changing the preschoolers’ perceptions of these vitamin-packed plants resulted in a lasting 50 percent increase in vegetable consumption. And if that’s not enough, similar results have been shown with adult subjects. So, go ahead and try this one at home! "
ANIMALS RISK HOMELESSNESS,https://vegnews.com/2009/3/animals-risk-homelessness,"MARCH 2, 2009","When the economy is stuck in a slump, it’s only natural for people to wield their wallets with more care, but what does that mean for America’s animal companions? A sharp spike in home foreclosures has led Dr. Stephen Zawistowski, executive vice president of ASPCA Programs, to warn that between 500,000 and one million animals are at risk of ending up homeless. In order to ease the burden on animal shelters and prevent these companions from being left out in the cold, there are several things you can do. Opening your home to a rescue pet (even just temporarily as a foster guardian) is the obvious option, but every effort helps, including donating used blankets, towels, and tennis balls to your local shelter.

Not only do his years of experience give him the cred to shed light on a notoriously tangled topic, but he also carries a stand-up comic gene that’ll have you laughing yourself silly while brushing up on your nutrition know-how. In his “Latest in Clinical Nutrition” paper, he condensed all of the English-language nutrition studies published in 2008 (7,326 of them, to be exact), taking information that could be considered dry and bringing it to life in an informative and thought-provoking manner. Did we mention that the good doctor also happens to be a 20-year vegan? While in San Francisco recently, Greger delivered his informative lecture in his trademark quiz-show format. In honor of his unique pedagogical technique, we bring you a brand-new VegNews Nutrition Quiz. Put your thinking cap on and see just how much you know about nutrition facts and fictions. Q: True or False: A handful of nuts a day is beneficial to your health.
A: Drum roll, please … The correct answer is … True! According to the most recent nutrition data, a daily handful of nuts like almonds, walnuts, peanuts, cashews, and pecans can cut your risk of heart attack in half. So get cracking! Q: Which is better for you—coffee or tea?
A: While two cups of filtered coffee a day is beneficial to your overall health, tea is the winner here, thanks to its antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer qualities. And while we’re talking tea, not all cups are created equal. Green tea is the healthiest of the bunch, so keep that in mind next time you’re brewing a pot. Q: How many servings of fruits and vegetables should you get per day?
A: The magic number is … nine! Q: Which food is healthier—edamame or tempeh?
A: While both are whole foods and great additions to any diet, the probiotics created in the fermentation process make tempeh come out on top here. Q: We all know the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away, but just which type of apple is best?
A: Red Delicious apples are the most nutritious, followed by Granny Smith and Gala. Q: Who smells better—vegans or meat eaters?
A: If you’re reading this, chances are you won’t be surprised by the answer, but a recent study showed that women gave higher ratings of attractiveness to body odor produced by men who were not eating meat. Best of the bunch
We all know that whole foods and fresh fruits and vegetables should form the basis of any diet, but if you want to earn a gold star in nutrition, read on for Dr. Greger’s picks. The healthiest variety of your favorite food may not be what you expect. Mushrooms

PRIMATES ARE NOT PETS,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/primates-are-not-pets,"FEBRUARY 26, 2009","The recent nationally publicized chimpanzee attack in Stamford, Conn. has propelled primate pets into the public eye. Travis—a ten-year-old chimpanzee who violently lashed out at a friend of his guardian—had been treated just like a human child. This behavior, it turns out, is not that uncommon among those who keep primates in their homes. An exposé in The New York Times profiles several chimpanzee guardians who have shared this experience—being enchanted by an infant animal, often dressing them in diapers and feeding them with baby bottles, and learning the hard way that once they hit puberty, these companions often become unpredictable and dangerous.

The organization’s carbon footprint comes to a whopping 3 percent of the nation’s total, with meat served at its network of hospitals one of the primary culprits. In an effort to step up its game, NHS is pledging to whittle that figure down 80 percent by 2050. While there are no promises to go completely veg as of yet, they are determined to omit meat from the majority of its menus, and focus instead on fresh fruit, vegetables, and grains. Taking its cue from this groundbreaking gesture, PETA is urging Massachusetts General Hospital to join the meat-free movement as well. "
FAIR-TRADE BANANA BINGE,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/fair-trade-banana-binge,"FEBRUARY 24, 2009","Being a savvy consumer means surveying not only what you are buying, but also how it was produced (check out our Food, Inc. feature in the January+February edition for a more in-depth investigation). If you’d rather take more immediate action, how about bingeing on bananas this weekend? In an effort to cultivate more compassionate consumption, UK-based Fairtrade Foundation is hosting the world’s biggest banana-eating attempt as part of their Fairtrade Fortnight. To qualify, you simply need to nosh on a fair-trade banana between noon on Friday and noon on Saturday. With more than 159,000 people signed up so far, it’s obvious they’re not monkeying around. "
COK ADVERTISES ON MTV,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/cok-advertises-on-mtv,"FEBRUARY 23, 2009","While NBC proved too conservative for PETA’s provocative veg promo, MTV hasn’t shied away from Compassion Over Killing’s cruelty-free commercials. For the next five weeks, music video lovers across America will have the pleasure of viewing a variety of 30-second pro-vegetarian ads, exposing the truth behind the animal products on their plates. While COK’s campaign cost doesn’t compare to McDonald’s billion-dollar advertising budget, the seven clips, which document the truth behind factory farms and critter cruelty, are aimed at the nation’s most impressionable minds. MTV’s bad rap for nourishing America’s teenage wasteland may change, but do you think teens will change their tune and go veg? "
SEAL SLAUGHTER,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/seal-slaughter,"FEBRUARY 22, 2009","Perhaps best known for its hockey fans, maple leaves, and Celine Dion, Canada is also home to the largest slaughter of marine mammals on Earth. Our not-as-friendly-as-we-thought neighbor to the north is responsible for hundreds of thousands of seal deaths annually. These snuggly creatures, killed for their fashionable fur, suffer a brutal death as they are viciously beat or shot to death by fishermen intent on making a profit. As the Yukon Territory prepares to host the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, it best also plan for an onslaught of criticism by animal lovers worldwide—including you!

INTERVIEW WITH VEGAN BAND TRUTH ON EARTH,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/interview-with-vegan-band-truth-on-earth,"FEBRUARY 22, 2009","Serena, Kiley, and Tess—who, channeling Cher, use only their first names—are like most teen sisters. They listen to rock music, hang out with friends, and love vegan chocolate-chip cookies. Oh, except that music they’re listening to? Their own ‘60s and ‘70s-inspired soulful tunes. And those friends? Legions of fans at the trio’s concerts. The cookies come courtesy of Kiley, who in addition to her rockstar responsibilities, has a sweet baking business on the side. Truth on Earth, their band, is dedicated to raising awareness of myriad global injustices and uses their position to encourage others to take action. With songs on topics ranging from starvation to factory farms to cyber bullying, there’s no doubt these ladies are super-serious about their mission. VN recently caught up with the trio to talk music, morals, and must-have vegan items. VegNews: What projects are you currently working on?
Serena: For the past year, all of our time has been devoted to writing, recording, performing, networking, doing interviews, podcasts, music videos, keeping up with our superstar fans, and linking with organizations that are actively working to solve the problems we sing about. Whenever we are on the road we also try to learn as much as we can about the problems the world faces and the potential solutions we can promote through our mission. VN: What is it like being in a band with family members?
Tess: Being in a band together is one of the coolest things we’ve ever been a part of. We get along really well because we are best friends. We have each other to lean on and to discuss all our ideas together. Finding practice time is easy because we are always together. It’s a fantastic experience and one that has connected us for life. VN: You often mention that you were influenced by Gandhi’s beliefs. What drew you to Gandhi to begin with?
Kiley: We feel very fortunate that our parents educated us early on about Gandhi’s philosophies and the practice of spirituality. Gandhi saw that every living creature on Earth was important, and he worked diligently towards expanding peace and reducing violence on the planet. Some of the things that drew us to him were the immense amount of courage and strength he had and the millions of people he influenced with his unique organized method of non-violent protest. We find it incredibly inspirational that one little man accomplished so much and made such a huge difference in the lives of so many. VN: You donate 70 percent of your profits to charity. Do you have a favorite organization you’d like to share with us?
Serena: One of our favorite organizations is Animal Acres. They have a farmed-animal shelter in Los Angeles where they bring in animals that were abused, saved from slaughter, or have no home. We also really like The Anti Defamation League, Seal Action Protection Group, Vegan Peace, Humane Teen, Action Against Hunger, and Mercy For Animals. VN: What vegan food could you not live without?
Serena: Silk Chocolate Soymilk
Kiley: Tofu that I make with a variety of Asian sauces
Tess: Kiley’s pies and cookies Visit Truth on Earth online, on MySpace, and on Facebook. "
INTERVIEW WITH A VEGAN DRINKS VETERAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/interview-with-a-vegan-drinks-veteran,"FEBRUARY 22, 2009","OK, you don’t technically have to be vegan to attend Vegan Drinks—no one will check your Vegan ID at the door. However, if you want to take part in a socializing opportunity that is taking the nation by storm, definitely stop by your local chapter. Even if alcohol is as verboten for you as meat, Vegan Drinks is a great way to meet other veg-friendly folk in your area, talk shop, talk things other than shop—for once!—and generally kick back and unwind, whether it’s with a custom martini, discounted brew, or tall, chilled glass of cranberry-orange juice. Getting together with other people who are as dedicated to the cause as you are—and inviting those who are just dipping their toes into the veg pool—can be a refreshing, energizing experience, not to mention a fantastic way to wind down after work. Don’t know of an event in your neighborhood? Not to worry, you can always start your own! To get a little more insight into the sipping sensation, VN caught up with Deborah Diamant, who co-organized the very first Vegan Drinks in New York City way back in May of last year. VegNews: What’s your favorite aspect of Vegan Drinks?
Deborah Diamant: I’ve witnessed many friendships form and strengthen since we launched back in May. In particular, I loved watching some of the Long Island Food Not Bombs folks meet some of their Brooklyn (Bedford-Stuyvesant) Food Not Bombs counterparts for the first time during the June Vegan Drinks. Both groups now regularly support one another. VN: Since the event’s inception last May, there are now Vegan Drinks in eight cities across the country. Did you expect Vegan Drinks would catch on in as many cities as it has?
DD: I expected that the idea would catch on, but not nearly as quickly as it did. VN: What about vegans who don’t drink? Is Vegan Drinks still fun?
DD: I can’t speak for all teetotalers (especially since I’m not one), but of my friends who don’t drink and regularly come to Vegan Drinks, I can safely say that they have a very good time. Vegan Drinks certainly isn’t for everyone—not everyone likes a loud bar—but we get many repeat attendees (drinkers and non-drinkers alike) to our event. VN: What’s the most unexpected event/connection/random circumstance to come out of Vegan Drinks so far?
DD: I met someone with the same last name as me! And, we’re apparently not related! It only took 31 years, a few months, and a vegan happy-hour to make it happen! The first installment of San Francisco Vegan Drinks will be held this Thursday, and is proudly sponsored by VegNews Magazine. Around the country there are events in Cleveland, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, Salt Lake City, the Twin Cities, and Washington DC. "
VEGAN ON AMERICA’S NEXT TOP MODEL,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/vegan-on-americas-next-top-model,"FEBRUARY 22, 2009","Though she didn’t land the coveted contract with Elite Model Management, Elina Ivanova certainly won a few fans when she managed to bring her veganism to the forefront of the hugely popular reality-television show, “America’s Next Top Model.” VN chats with the lovely 19-year-old Seattleite about animal activism, enjoying the veg lifestyle, and her time in the public eye. VegNews: What was it like being vegan on the set of ANTM? Did you have to cook for yourself or were your meals provided?
Elina Ivanova: Being a vegan on ANTM was harder than I thought it would be. The meals were provided at times, although they were mostly just vegetables and no one really knew what to give me. Everyone did the best they could, and I must say, I really appreciated the effort. At the model house we had the option of buying our own groceries, so that did help a little. I just couldn’t wait to get home, and be able to eat a balanced, nutritional, vegan diet with variety! VN: What vegan product can you not live without?
EI: Tofutti cream cheese! I have to have blueberry bagels with strawberry jelly and cream cheese! VN: What do you hope to accomplish before you reach 30?
EI: I hope to be a stable, working model, maintaining some sort of celebrity, and having a large audience to reach with my animal-rights activism. VN: If you were president, you’d …
EI: Do as much as possible to reach a place in our country where humans have barely any contact with animals and no longer use them as food, clothes, etc. VN: What responsibility do people who, like yourself, have the media’s attention for something that isn’t related to veganism (like ANTM) have to promote the cause?
EI: I have a very big responsibility, and using my platform to speak about animal rights is my first priority. Each person who is lucky enough to have the attention of the media should take advantage and speak out on something they would like to change in the world. VN: How do you see the vegan movement growing/changing in the next five years?
EI: I have noticed the level of awareness has increased in the media and fashion industry. I think more people will speak out and try everything to be effective. The smallest change always sparks hope in people who may have thought that change wasn’t possible, which inspires them to be effective, too. VN: How has the experience of being vegan changed since you first went veg two years ago?
EI: It was a challenge at first, but now it’s second nature. I sometimes forget that I’m a vegan when other people ask me, because to me it’s almost like I’m no longer aware of other diets and just think that everyone eats like I do—ha! "

SILVERSTONE TAKES TO THE STAGE,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/silverstone-takes-to-the-stage,"FEBRUARY 19, 2009","Lights! Camera! Action!—three little words vegetarian advocate Alicia Silverstone won’t be hearing anytime soon. Perhaps most famous for lighting up the silver screen in Clueless, Scoobie Doo, and more recently in a rather risqué PETA testimonial, this compassionate actress has strayed ever-so-slightly from cinema stardom to advance her red-curtain career. She hasn’t gone far from Hollywood, though. Silverstone is currently starring in playwright Donald Margulies’ “Time Stands Still,” at the Geffen Playhouse in LA. The play debuted earlier this month and will run through mid-March. So, don’t stand still—grab your tickets today to check out this vegetarian starlet! "
GORE HINTS AT VEG LIFESTYLE,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/gore-hints-at-veg-lifestyle,"FEBRUARY 18, 2009","Take Action! And go veg while you’re at it! Al Gore’s website now publicly recognizes the effects of animal agriculture on the destruction of the environment. The introduction to his long list of ways individuals can reduce the size of their eco-footprint now reads: “Since agriculture is responsible for about a fifth of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, you can reduce your emissions simply by watching what you eat.” Is Gore finally admitting the inconvenient truth of his carnivorous consumption? Unfortunately, the less-than-explicit nature of his advice points to no. In that case, this certainly seems like a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black. "
COFFEE LOWERS STROKE RISK,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/coffee-lowers-stroke-risk,"FEBRUARY 16, 2009","Coffee drinkers can now claim—yet another —good reason to feed their caffeine craving. According to the Journal of the American Heart Association, women drinking four or more cups of coffee a day witnessed a whopping 43% reduction in risk for stroke. But caffeine from your cup o’ tea, can o’ cola, or cocoa bean won’t do the job; that’s because the benefit does not appear to come from caffeine, but rather, from antioxidants and other compounds specific to coffee. If four cups a day seems daunting, you’ll be happy to know that women who averaged even one cup per day saw a significant risk reduction. So, go ahead and drink to your health! "
ALL ABOUT HEMP,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/all-about-hemp,"FEBRUARY 15, 2009","Hemp, it appears, is hip. Considering how long humans have been cultivating it—12,000 years—hemp hardly seems newsworthy. And yet this versatile plant is enjoying a genuine Renaissance. Almost overnight, natural-food stores are filled with hemp milk, hemp salad dressings, and hemp cereal, each package touting hemp as a superfood. Socially responsible companies are turning to hemp as a more sustainable source for paper goods and biodegradable plastic. Even hemp clothing is going mainstream, shedding its “burlap sack” image to become the eco-friendly choice of stylish stars and frugal fashionistas alike. Listening to advocates tell it, this vigorous plant—which is grown for food, fiber, and cold-pressed oil—is nothing short of a miracle crop. Hemp activist and author Jack Herer says its uses are practically unlimited. “Housing, paper, clothing, rugs, curtains, plastic—all these things can be made with hemp,” he says. “And it’s good for the planet.” Indeed, hemp will yield three to eight tons of fiber per acre—four times that of the average wood forest. Textiles and paper made with hemp are durable and long-lasting; it is a renewable source of fuel, and hemp is used in a natural, energy-efficient building material called hempcrete. Hempseed oil is even packed with Omega-3 and Omega-6 essential fatty acids. All this in a plant that needs no pesticides or herbicides. If only it were legal to grow this wonder flora in the United States. One needn’t dig too far into the dirt surrounding hemp to figure out the controversy here. People tend to confuse industrial hemp with the hallucinogenic hemp more commonly known as marijuana. Both hail from the Cannabis sativa family, but while its illicit botanical cousin contains high levels of a psychoactive ingredient called tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), less than one percent can be detected in industrial hemp. Ingesting industrial hemp for recreational, medicinal, or religious purposes would be like trying to get high from poppyseed bagels or non-alcoholic beer. Nonetheless, because the Drug Enforcement Administration classifies all Cannabis sativa plants as marijuana, the US has become the only industrialized nation in the world that does not allow the production of industrial hemp, though it’s fine to buy it elsewhere. As a result, US businesses like the Merry Hempsters must pay a premium to import zero-THC hemp from such countries as Canada, China, England, India, and Romania. The Hemp Industries Organization (HIA), a trade group representing more than 200 hemp companies and advocates in North America, estimates that US sales of hemp products in 2007 totaled $330 million. While that might seem like small change, “Hemp foods and hemp as a nutritional supplement will be huge,” says HIA Executive Director Eric Steenstra. “Hemp has the potential to surpass soy due to its excellent nutritional profile, being high in essential fatty acids.” Indeed, milk made from hemp seeds (specifically, the nut inside the shell) is the new kid on the beverage block, with two companies, Living Harvest and Manitoba Harvest, debuting their hemp-milk lines in 2006. “We tripled sales last year from $1 million to $3 million, and we hope to double this year,” says Christina Volgyesi, president of the Portland, Ore.-based Living Harvest. “Hemp is the fastest-growing shelf-stable milk alternative. It has a lot of versatility and great flavor.” Mike Fata, president of Manitoba Harvest, says his company is experiencing similar success with their organic hemp milk. ”Consumer demand is growing steadily and is projected to continue at a double-digit pace for at least the next few years,” he says. A farmer-owned Canadian company, Manitoba Harvest exports not just south of the border, but to Europe and Japan, where there’s been a gradual increase in exports. “Hemp has a long history in Asia, so people in Japan understand its benefits.” "
MORE SCHOOLS GO VEG,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/more-schools-go-veg,"FEBRUARY 15, 2009","Alice Waters’ Edible Schoolyard vision seems to be spreading like weeds, as educational institutions around the world consider produce-packed playgrounds and vegetarian friendly cafeterias. The idea of going veg is certainly nothing new to the Wycliffe College in Stonehouse, which has offered a meal discount to vegetarian students since 1882. Bringing a little competition to the plate, Harvard University recently hosted its first vegetarian cook-off after demand for more compassionate fare soared. A hot-off-the-press Obama-addressed PETA letter followed, arguing that all of America’s schools should adopt a meat-free menu. And grassroots organizations, such as The New York Coalition for Healthy School Foods, are doing all they can to encourage plant-based entrées and gardens. With headlines like these sprouting up everywhere, will kids be more likely to love their peas and carrots? "

Compassion Over Killing, Mercy For Animals, and the Animal Protection & Rescue League have joined forces to do just that—and invite you to lend a hand. The meat-free burger brand, first called upon to change its practices more than a year ago, concocts its vegetarian creations with eggs laid by battery-caged hens. These caged chickens, living in a space the size of a sheet of paper, are unable to bathe, nest, or walk. While many industry competitors, including Morningstar Farms, Lightlife Foods, Gardenburger, and Garden Protein have reduced or eliminated eggs from their product lines, BOCA has made little progress in the way of introducing vegan options.

"LOVE, VEGETARIAN STYLE",https://vegnews.com/2009/2/love-vegetarian-style,"FEBRUARY 12, 2009","WANTED: Tall, good-looking, funny, sexy, sensitive, creative, compassionate, emotionally balanced, supportive, understanding, non-smoking, spiritual, 20- to 75-year-old vegan who loves to cook, drives a hemp-powered vehicle and lives in a beautifully appointed earthship or solar-powered teak tree house, cares for the planet and its creatures, loves travel and moonlit walks on the beach, lives a spontaneous, bohemian, organic lifestyle, yet understands how to access all of life’s abundance—ie., American dollars—and is looking for a long-term loving relationship with an optimistic dreamer. No religious zealots need apply. It’s a jungle out there, and libidinous herbivores hunt and prowl for like-minded creatures to engage in cruelty-free romance. So just how do you find the vegetarian love of your life? Terry Jensen, a matchmaker for 12 years in the Dallas-Fort Worth area who also happens to be vegan, confirms that veggies do meet and marry, and counsels that success in meeting a match is directly proportional to effort. “The most likely person to marry a vegetarian,” she says, “is one who makes a concentrated effort to meet many other veg or veg-friendly singles.” Terry cautions, however, that it is not enough to share a common interest in eating. “For a successful relationship,” she advises, “there must be other shared interests and values as well as chemistry, or ‘sparks’.” How important is it for veg people to have a veg mate? Will strict vegans compromise diet and lifestyle for the sake of romance? Where do single vegetarians go to meet potential partners? And are vegetarians better lovers? I conducted an unscientific veggie romance survey of vegans and vegetarians from Canada, the United States, and Europe. I questioned people in health food stores from Alberta to Utah; interviewed friends, acquaintances, and veggie dating website members; talked to men and women, young and old, swingin’ singles and happily marrieds, gay and straight, Jewish, Buddhist, Christian and agnostic, in an effort to discover what’s happening in the world of veggie romance. Veggies on veggies: Is it important that your lover be veg?
Sally Grande, a youthful 54-year-old digital librarian from the greater Toronto area, has been vegetarian for 38 years and vegan for two. She was married for seven years in her twenties to a man she converted to vegetarianism. Since then, she’s had three serious relationships, two with carnivores and one with a partner who switched to vegetarianism after bypass surgery. Her focus, she says, has always been on a vegetarian/vegan household. “I feel that the kitchen is my temple, and when entertaining, I want to display the culinary diversity of my ideology, and I want to be comfortable in my own home.” Although she would settle for a part-time vegetarian mate as long as she could maintain a veggie household, Sally’s ideal is to meet a full-time vegetarian. “The person you want to build a home and future with should share at least some of your most deeply held convictions,” she says. Laura Parker, who met her husband of two years online, didn’t realize how important it was to live with another vegetarian until she did it. “There’s never a need for cooking two separate meals,” she says. “Lifetime partnerships are difficult enough without the disagreement over what foods are acceptable to eat, not only at home, but when you’re going out for meals or on vacation.” Some flesh-free folk are so focused on being with another vegetarian, however, that they become blinded to traits they might otherwise find unattractive. Fons Witteman, a vegan chef from Holland, says he compromised too much trying to date only vegetarian women. “Although being with another vegan eases the way of living together,” he says, “I realized that I was prepared to accept vegetarian women in my life without true feelings of love.” He is now engaged to a meat-eating Dutch woman whom he met while working at a vegetarian resort in France. Veggie singles’ hotspots: Where do veg singles meet?
If I were single and looking to find my vegan soulmate in Toronto, it would be a no-brainer: I’d hang out in Kensington Market, where a quiet revolution has been taking place with recent openings of several veg-friendly, organic specialty shops and restaurants, all highly concentrated within a few-block radius. I’d casually stroll through 4-Life on Augusta, sniffing organic tomatoes while waiting for him to brush my hand as he reached across to gently squeeze that perfectly yielding organic avocado; or I’d boldly meet his gaze from behind a jumbo eco-friendly corn-plastic cup of organic carrot-apple-ginger juice at Urban Herbivore, then pass him a biodegradable straw. Toronto just happens to be a particularly veg-friendly city, but for the overwhelming majority who don’t have access to wonderfully diverse veg venues, Terry Jensen recommends starting with the internet and matchmaking services but advises not stopping there. She suggests attending environmental, animal rights/welfare, and vegetarian meetings in your area, along with looking for organizations that have an active singles group, such as Sierra Singles. She’s found from experience that groups of “earth” or “green” singles attract more than groups of “vegetarian singles.” “If not actually vegetarian,” she says, “these singles are usually veg-friendly and are accustomed to eating vegetarian foods. They make suitable and understanding lovers and spouses for vegetarians.” Dirk Goldman, a 43-year-old trader from New York City who’s only been vegetarian a few months, says Whole Foods is the best place to meet healthy, active, single women. “You should see all the attractive women in organic produce!” he exclaimed. “It’s a vegetarian ‘meet’ market!” Tips for veggie dating success
In many ways, the dating challenges facing vegetarians are the same as those faced by omnivores; mutual attraction and chemistry between any two individuals is a rare phenomenon. Steve Urow of veggieedate.com advises that people not be too narrowly focused when searching for a mate, but that they also keep in mind their must-haves, or what he calls their ‘nonnegotiables,’ such as children, smoking, and animal companions, and to distinguish them from the ‘negotiables.’ “If the must-haves are not there, move on,” he suggests. “Don’t waste your time.” But he also warns that people often run into the trap of being too particular and having too many ‘must-haves.’ Matthew Levine and Jessica Coleman met on veggiedate.org eight months ago specifically because they were very particular. Neither one was willing to settle for an ‘almost,’ and luckily found a perfect fit in each other. Matthew, a vegan for more than three years, proposes doing what you love and love will find you. “In order to attract a veggie mate,” he said, “I needed to live an attractive veggie life.” He suggests closing the gap between who you are and the kind of person your ideal mate would find attractive. “I don’t just eat a vegan diet,” he said, “I live a vegan life.” Matthew volunteers at a farmed animal rescue sanctuary, hosts, and attends letter-writing parties, attends potlucks and social events, and loves to cook and dine at the many fantastic veg restaurants in the Bay Area. Jessica is happy to have met “the most sensitive man who ever lived” and says they lucked out in the chemistry department. Her advice to people looking for love is simple: “Relax. Enjoy the great food and the benefits to your health, animals, and the environment. The love you bring to the world will meet its match sooner or later.” What’s your veg love story?

"BUY EXPERIENCES, NOT OBJECTS",https://vegnews.com/2009/2/buy-experiences-not-objects,"FEBRUARY 10, 2009","Ever hear of an unhappy camper? Didn’t think so. Assistant psychology professor at San Francisco State University Ryan Howell explains why. His recent research, made public earlier this week at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology annual meeting, suggests that spending money on experiences, rather than objects, is the safest bet when it comes to investing in eternal happiness. Howell theorizes that experiences bolster well-being by offering increased connections with others and a greater sense of vitality. Although most study subjects reported overall satisfaction with purchased possessions, the initial enjoyment associated with objects tapered with time, whereas feelings surrounding pleasant memories persisted. So, if you’re deciding between a new television and a two-week getaway to Costa Rica, forgo the former to ensure perpetual pleasure. "

INTERVIEW WITH KRIS CARR,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/interview-with-kris-carr,"FEBRUARY 7, 2009","As you may have already read in the current issue of VegNews, Kris Carr is a force to be reckoned with. She’s managing a rare, incurable cancer. She’s made a documentary, written books, and toured the country giving inspiring speeches to her fellow crazy sexy survivors. This unstoppable lady also just launched a brand-new, super-fun website that brings together a group of all-star “Blog Posse” of experts, news, events, a revamped forum, videos, recipes, and pretty much everything else you could ever want in a body-cleansing, planet-saving, veggie-eating, juice-making resource. VN chats with the very busy lady to expand on her crazy, sexy philosophy. VegNews: You’ve gone through quite a bit to get to where you are now. How do you see your job?
Kris Carr: We get so caught up in our busy lives and I think women tend to definitely put themselves last. We’re the caretakers, and we always think there’ll be time for us if we finish these 100 things and freedom is just around the corner. That’s the first thing that you change when you get diagnosed. Those beliefs change immediately, and that’s a blessing. Why should I wait until I’m retired to live the life that I want to live? Why shouldn’t every day be the best life ever? It takes hard work to be happy. I quit my job, I sold my house, I went back to school for nutrition, I renovated my little black book. I cut the fat. The body is made up of all these different cubbies, and we’re stuffed. And if we’re stuffed with this bad food, we’re stuffed with this negative emotion, then we’re bound to get sick. So my job as someone who is healing and is helping to facilitate healing in others, is really just to unravel that. That’s what prevention is all about—waking people up before the tragedy happens. VN: Can people wake themselves up?
KC: Each one of us has an inner physician. When you can find the space between the noise, that’s where your inner physician lives, which is why, first and foremost, setting up a daily meditation practice is key. I’ve never met one person, and I talk with thousands of people, who tells me that they didn’t know something was coming. They might not have known it was cancer but they knew it was something. VN: What’s most important in your life?
KC: The most important thing in life is—this is going to sound really hippie-like, I swear I’m not making out with a tree right now—I would say it’s love and compassion. You can’t go wrong, you can’t make mad, bad decisions if you work from the place of love and compassion. "
ANIMAL-DERIVED PRESCRIPTIONS,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/animal-derived-prescriptions,"FEBRUARY 7, 2009","Concerned by the animal-derived gelatin encapsulating your prescription medication? Then swallow this. Pharmaceutical company GTC Biotherapeutics has genetically modified 200 goats to produce milk enriched with a human blood protein. Once extracted, this protein can be used to create a blood clot-prevention drug—a drug now approved by the FDA. While the pharmaceutical industry argues that deriving medication from animal milk, rather than human plasma and cell cultures, will lower costs and prevent shortages, animal advocates fear that the approval will open the floodgates to a host of other transgenic mammal-produced products. "
CDC’S SUSPICIOUS SURVEY,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/cdcs-suspicious-survey,"FEBRUARY 7, 2009","Contrary to what dozens of media stories have suggested recently, there isn’t much news about childhood vegetarianism based on the Centers for Disease Control study on the foods American children are consuming. Countless articles have appeared on the topic, nearly all of them alleging that the CDC found that one in 200 American children, or 367,000 kids, are vegetarian. But earlier surveys found between two and six percent of American youth are forgoing meat in their diet, which equates to more than a million eight-to-18-year-olds. Which survey do we believe? This isn’t just a matter of margin of error. For anyone who takes the time to read the actual wording of the surveys, it’s clear we’re talking apples and oranges, or perhaps, apples and hamburgers. The earlier surveys actually asked about what kids are eating, while the CDC survey barely touches on it. As some experts point out, including Jack Norris, RD, the CDC survey is in no way a reliable estimate of how many kids are vegetarian. Designed to estimate the number of Americans who use complementary or alternative medicine, the CDC only asked two questions about vegetarianism—whether or not the child had followed a “special diet” for health reasons (definitions of “special diets” included vegetarian, macrobiotic, Atkins, Ornish, Zone, and South Beach), and if the child had tried to “treat a specific health problem or condition other than weight control or weight loss” by adhering to any of those diets. In other words, a large number of vegetarian kids would never be counted in such a survey because they’re not likely abstaining from meat-eating for health or medical reasons. While there are many health benefits associated with being vegetarian, it certainly isn’t the only reason people opt to leave animals off their plates. Many kids choose vegetarianism for a whole host of other reasons such as animal welfare, environmental, spiritual, and social. The largest study of vegetarian teens ever published, which surveyed nearly 5,000 adolescents from 31 Minnesota public middle schools and high schools, found that the number-one reason given for consuming a vegetarian diet was not wanting to kill animals. While it certainly would be more helpful to have more accurate and thorough surveys, there’s an enormous amount of anecdotal evidence that a vegetarian lifestyle is catching on, and not just with kids. Whether it’s social icons such as Oprah and Ellen touting the benefits of a plant-based diet, food magazines like Gourmet adding monthly vegetarian columns, the exploding popularity of meat alternatives, or the ever-growing number of blogs, websites, and online forums dedicated to the lifestyle, it’s clear that society’s trajectory is toward more meat-free eating. If one in 200 American children are choosing vegetarian diets for health or medical reasons, surely there must be many more who choose plant-based eating for any of the other myriad reasons kids embrace such a lifestyle. We don’t know how many American children may be vegetarian, but we can say that the recent stories asserting the one in 200 number should be taken with a healthy dose of salt, and, perhaps, a veggie burger, too. Guest writer Paul Shapiro is the senior director of The Humane Society of the United States’ factory-farming campaign. "

A University of California at Riverside study accusing three of the most commonly used ingredients in sunscreens with cancer-causing free radical formation, is saying yes. But don‘t toss your tube just yet. While octyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, and oxybenzone may increase oxidative damage over time when absorbed into the skin, simmering under the sun SPF-free is not the solution.

The legal suit against Ringling Bros.’ Circus, which hit the stage nearly nine years ago, has finally made its way to the US District Court. While “The Greatest Show on Earth” continues to claim humane animal treatment, a number of animal-rights groups have forced the company into an unflattering spotlight once again—this time armed with the Endangered Species Act. The plaintiffs’ case relies heavily upon the testimony of Tom Rider, a former Ringling Bros.’ employee with eyewitness accounts of mishandling and maltreatment, included chaining, beating, and slashing. Stay tuned to see if the circus wins the act, or is forced to leave the largest land animal alone. "

ANTIBIOTICS EVERYWHERE,https://vegnews.com/2009/2/antibiotics-everywhere,"FEBRUARY 2, 2009","The phrase “food is medicine” has recently acquired a whole new—and frightening—meaning. Enlightening research conducted by the University of Minnesota suggests that even organic produce, grown in soil fertilized with manure, absorbs unwanted antibiotics. In fact, 90 percent of drugs doled out to farm animals are eventually excreted, making their way into the same water and soil that sustains your local, seasonal, organic diet. Shocked? So are we. While antibiotics put up an unparalleled fight against deadly bacterial infections, overuse has been blamed for increased rates of asthma and allergies as well as the evolution of scary superbugs. We vote is in favor of mainstreaming “veganic” produce—100 percent free of animal products and antibiotics. "

Due to the hypersexual nature of PETA’s proposed game-day ad, NBC is refusing to air the controversial commercial portraying scantily clad women seducing a plethora of fresh produce. The commercial, which suggests saying bon voyage to Viagra in favor of a vegetarian diet, apparently exceeds the networks more conservative standards.

Actor Rob Sedgwick and restaurateur Steve Horn own the parlor, where they concoct dairy-free ice cream from soy, nut, and coconut milks. Even though the prices are steep for these vegan delights—scoops start at $4.25—flavors such as bananas foster, chocolate chunk mint, salted caramel pecan, coconut almond joy, and cardamom pistachio are well worth the splurge.

Yes, that’s the same chemical found to threaten vital organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs—not to mention the nervous systems of developing infants. The Minneapolis-based non-profit scanned the shelves for products listing high-fructose corn syrup as the first or second ingredient by weight and found 17 of the 55 foods tested tainted with detectable levels of mercury. With Hunt’s Tomato Ketchup, Hershey’s Chocolate Syrup, and Frosted Blueberry Pop Tarts topping the list of contaminated products, natural sweeteners such as agave, maple syrup, and organic sugars have never looked better.

In fact, if you’re a woman under the age of 50, investing in a quality kettle could cut your risk of breast cancer by up to 37 percent. The article, published in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention, gives a gold star to green tea and its potent polyphenols.

AIR IMPROVEMENTS AND LIFESPAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/1/air-improvements-and-lifespan,"JANUARY 26, 2009","Thanks to clean-air initiatives mandated over the past two decades, Americans can now expect to live an average of 21 weeks longer. That’s right, due to a significant decline in fine particles emitted by cars, engines, factories, and power plants, now’s the time to start making plans for another five months of existence. The study, headed by Brigham Young University epidemiologist, Arden Pope, revealed that cities with greater air-quality improvement added even more years to its citizens’ lives. With an estimated 1.4 percent deaths worldwide resulting from air pollution, this encouraging news bolsters the argument in favor of regulation and proves that air quality really is a matter of life and death.

A long-time vegan and co-editor/contributor of Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions, Sunstein supports the extension of legal rights to animal and condemns acts of cruelty and exploitation. His appointment has animal-rights advocates everywhere anticipating stricter guidelines for animal-dependent industries, including fashion, science, agriculture, and entertainment. Although the “Regulation Czar” has traditionally been a position of limited scope, Obama’s call for increased regulation may grant it greater power.

Research from the US National Cancer Institute suggests that eating an extra serving of fruit or vegetables per 1,000 calories consumed may reduce rates of mouth, head, and neck cancers by up to six percent. The British Dental Health Foundation has swallowed this news hard, urging UK citizens to nosh on more fruits and veggies in hopes of reducing the 5,000 mouth-cancer cases reported in the country annually. The study found that people eating six portions of produce daily, compared to the recommended five, were 30 percent less likely to develop an invasive oral illness. "

Palin led similar efforts to block polar bear protection laws proposed by the Bush Administration last year.

VEGAN IN KENYA,https://vegnews.com/2009/1/vegan-in-kenya,"JANUARY 24, 2009","Maybe you’ve been just a tad overcome with enthusiasm about a certain 44th president. Maybe you’re so freakin’ excited about our recent change in leadership that you’ve decided to do what any rational, adventurous person would—take a trip to Kenya to check out the homeland of our new leader’s father. Or, maybe you just want to go someplace warm in January and check out the free-roaming wildlife. Lions, anyone? “We’d followed the GPS signal for Diana for awhile when we finally came across the big female with three nearly full-grown cubs resting just ahead of us. The biggest cub got up and strolled toward the Land Rover while staring right at us, then lay down not more than eight feet away. He stared intensely at Alex Gombe, the project assistant, who was wearing a black and white striped sweater. Maybe he was thinking: Zebra?” Kathy Evans now holds the rare distinction of having one of those African lioness cubs named after her. The Dayton, Ohio, animal lover experienced this up-close and personal moment of pride while gathering data on her most recent of four trips to southeast Kenya as an Earthwatch volunteer. The “Lions of Tsavo” is a research project set up to study the behavior and ecology of lions in and around the Tsavo National Parks and to provide volunteers access to a fascinating world overlooked by more conventional safaris. Tsavo’s lions, the largest protected population in Kenya, are known to attack livestock and humans. Earthwatch provides the Kenya Wildlife Service with crucial information for livestock management, which in turn helps ensure the survival of the lions in their ever-shrinking habitat outside park boundaries. Volunteers are taught to use specialized scientific equipment, basic Swahili, and flora and fauna species identification. They’re then sent out with experienced researchers in Land Rovers into dense acacia woodlands in the middle of the night to locate lions, searching for tracks, radio contacts, or eye shine—and listening. “The most chilling, most wonderful sounds heard during the African night are the roars of the lions,” Kathy says. Once spotted, the beasts are photographed and observed for space-use patterns, interactions, and food habits. When it is safe to do so, biological samples are taken. Like the creatures they track, volunteers take a mid-day siesta in their private tented camp in the Taita/Rukinga Wildlife Conservancy overlooking the vast expanse of unspoiled wilderness. The meals are well balanced and expertly prepared. Vegetarians (especially those who love African and Asian spices) will enjoy a variety of healthful fruits, vegetables, and grains. Earthwatch Institute invented this form of adventure travel in 1971, in which volunteers share the costs of the research while working side by side with leading scientists. There are dozens of projects to choose from. At the waterhole below, elephant, cheetah, impala, warthog, buffalo, lesser kudu, baboons, and vervet monkeys come to drink. But it’s Kenya’s lions that are the star attraction. "
INTERVIEW WITH BILLY HULTING,https://vegnews.com/2009/1/interview-with-billy-hulting,"JANUARY 24, 2009","At this year’s Grammy Awards show, a slew of vegetarian musicians—Leona Lewis and Jason Mraz, for starters—will be walking down the red carpet and possibly taking home one of those shiny statuettes. But never mind those guys—the nominee we want to see win the coveted award is VN friend and all-around good guy Billy Hulting. As a percussionist with the band Zappa Plays Zappa, Hulting and his fellow bandmates have been nominated in the Best Rock Instrumental Peformance category for “Peaches En Regalia.” With just two weeks before the big event, Hulting took a moment out of his busy schedule to talk with VegNews about what the rock-star life is all about. VegNews: Have you ever been to the Grammy’s before?
Billy Hulting: No. My entire career I’ve been a side man. We never go to the Grammys. This year is different because we were nominated as a band. VN: Are you excited about attending the ceremony?
BH: Yes! Even though part of me believes the Grammys is one of those events where they cram 30 minutes of entertainment into three hours, it’s still the freakin’ Grammys! VN: If you win and get up on stage with the band and you get 10 seconds to make a speech and thank everyone, where do you think you’ll start?
BH: I’d have to thank my parents, my teachers especially—Jerry Steinholtz—Dweezil, and the rest of the band. I’ll also have to find some message of compassion I can throw in for the last five seconds that’s coherent and meaningful. It’s tough to pass up a major media possibility without plugging the movement. VN: Is anyone else in the band veg?
BH: Steve Vai, the first year we were out. Otherwise, no. Well, some of the crew guys say they prefer to eat veg, but I haven’t always seen it demonstrated. Aaron [Arntz] goes with me to all the veg restaurants and eats primarily veg on the tour. Catering always has a vegan option at every meal, and some of the band and crew will go for it. Of all my vegan friends, I probably have the most contact in my daily life with people who aren’t vegetarian. It’s a little depressing to watch people I care about shovel crap into their bodies knowing full well what it does to their health, the animals, and the planet. I try to set an example. Sometimes it’s effective, sometimes it isn’t. I bring things up, but we all know you have to choose your battles. VN: Do you have a day job?
BH: I have a few side projects. One of them is WorldFest. It’s a big animal-rights, environmental, and health festival in Los Angeles. This year it’ll be held May 16. I co-produce it and am also entertainment director, production manager, and sponsor coordinator. We have a few stages with bands, a great kids’ area, animal adoptions, more than 120 exhibitors, a killer food court, and more. And the best part is it’s all vegan! I believe it’s LA’s largest all-vegan festival. The other project I’m working on now is a business called Session Pros. It’s a site where anyone in the world can hire great talent for music productions. Anything from hiring musicians to play on your CD to having someone produce it for you. We’re offering a lot of services all geared to help enhance your world of music. Watch the Grammys on Sunday, February 8 at 8pm on CBS. Billy’s Best Bets

INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL FRANTI,https://vegnews.com/2009/1/interview-with-michael-franti,"JANUARY 18, 2009","With not one but three inauguration-related performances scheduled during the next two days, Michael Franti is a man in demand. You’ll find the longhaired front man playing at Al Gore’s Green Inaugural Ball, the Rock the Vote Inauguration Party, and the Inaugural Peace Ball. In 2009, he’ll also launch a new yoga-inspired clothing line, write a follow-up to his children’s book, and make documentaries, but first things first; welcoming the era of Obama. VN talks with the musician about his longtime vegetarianism and life on the road. VegNews: How long have you been vegetarian?
Michael Franti: Since 1997. Since the time that I stopped eating meat, there’s been so much new consciousness in this country about health and sustainability. And everywhere I go, no matter how small the town, there’s always a food co-op or there’s always a Whole Foods or some other larger chain that’s providing organic food. And even Walmart today is providing organic food. VN: So, on international tours have you found any countries to be different or is it kind of a global awareness?
MF: A lot of the quote unquote developing world has been using plant proteins out of necessity for a long time because people just can’t afford meat. They use tofu or other vegetable proteins, gluten, or just beans and rice, so I don’t find it that difficult in my travels. Backstage in our dressing room we always have hummus and salad, rice, and tofu dogs, which all the guys in the band—even the meat eaters—all love. VN: Your mother was from European lineage, your father was African American and Native American, and you were raised by two adoptive Finnish parents. How has that shaped the work you do now, and what do you think the direction of our country might be with our new president also having a multi-racial identity?
MF: For a long time when I was a kid, having that type of family was a burden for me. You know, I felt like I was being judged by others all the time, and I wasn’t; I was viewed as a black person by white people but I wasn’t viewed as being black enough by black people, so I felt like an outsider. And what it did is give me a unique opportunity to really understand who I am from the inside out. And in doing that, I learned that I could connect with people of all types, and I think—from what I’ve read—that’s been the experience of Barack Obama, as well. Finding that who I am, who he is, from the inside out, then being able to connect with people of any race, gender, sexual orientation, or religious background. I think that’s truly a great model for a 21st century leader, especially at this time when there’s so much division in the world between race and religion, gender, and sexual preference. We really need somebody who is able to sit down and listen and embrace people for who they are, and the content of their character, not just who they are on the outside. "
INTERVIEW WITH ERIC PRESCOTT ON I’M VEGAN,https://vegnews.com/2009/1/interview-with-eric-prescott-on-im-vegan,"JANUARY 18, 2009","Eric Prescott is a busy guy. As head of the Boston Vegan Association, you’ll often find him organizing karaoke nights and preparing lectures, and as a blogger, he’s never too far from his trusty computer. Here and there he also works as an actor, freelance writer, and public speaker. But the project occupying most of his time these days is his in-the-works documentary film project titled I’m Vegan. Here, Prescott talks about what it’s like producing a vegan film that’s not like the others. VegNews: What spawned the idea for I’m Vegan?
Eric Prescott: I’d been playing around with the idea to tell the story of veganism that would personalize it and make it more accessible. I was struck by the explosion of YouTube and other web 2.0 developments, particularly the social-networking phenomenon. More and more, the web allows people to generate and share content in new and affordable ways, which continues to evolve along with the increasing accessibility of near-professional grade equipment. Out of all this swirling creativity and potential, I’m Vegan emerged as a way to give veganism a face. Plus, hey, I love to travel and meet new people, so this ought to be a lot of fun! VN: In what ways is this film different from other vegan-oriented documentaries?
EP: One is that it isn’t designed to beat you over the head with all the reasons you should be vegan, or all the things that are wrong with using and consuming animals (though of course it will be impossible to avoid these topics). I’m Vegan is about vegans as people who have committed to the idea that they don’t need to contribute to harming or otherwise dominating animals, and about how they integrate this commitment into their daily lives. It’s more ethnography than propaganda. The idea is to normalize veganism by demystifying it, by portraying a diverse array of vegans that bust stereotypes and connect with viewers on a personal level. It’s my hope that personalizing veganism this way makes it far more interesting and accessible. VN: What’s your I’m Vegan story?
EP: Like many people, I had always considered myself animal-friendly. It seems like dogs and cats were an omnipresent if sometimes mystifying part of my family. I even spent one summer in my teens volunteering at an animal shelter. Having grown up in the Midwest, with animal products solidly at the center of my diet, I had never made the connection between the animals I ate and those I considered family. But several years ago I was procrastinating on a screenwriters’ web forum and saw another forum member’s link that simply said “moo.” I wish I could remember every page I clicked through that afternoon, but it’s all a blur today. Suffice it to say that I witnessed the many ways in which animals are used for human profit and pleasure and I learned that it was completely unnecessary. I started seeing animals as ends in themselves, not the means to our ends. I went vegan and I never looked back. "
VEGAN IN CAMBODIA,https://vegnews.com/2009/1/vegan-in-cambodia,"JANUARY 18, 2009","From a seat at one of Phnom Penh’s many hip, European-style outdoor cafés overlooking the Mekong river, it’s easy to forget that Cambodia is still dusting itself off from a recent history marked by civil war, foreign invasions and occupation, famine, and a brutal communist dictatorship. The Khmer Rouge, with the infamous xenophobe Pol Pot at the helm, held the country hostage from 1974 to 1979, arbitrarily killing millions of Cambodians. But with remarkable resilience, the kingdom has emerged from the ashes of war and political instability, and nowhere is this more evident than in the vibrant capital city of Phnom Penh. To learn more about Khmer history, I hire a motorcycle and driver ($7/day) to shuttle me to important historical landmarks in and around the city. Rambo, my 25-year-old driver and unofficial tour guide, recommends the Tuol Sleng Museum and the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek. Before entering the museum, I head across the street to The Boddhi Tree, a popular restaurant and guest house jam-packed with tourists, and order the grilled tofu on a baguette off their extensive veg menu. Eating first turns out to be a wise move; a former Khmer Rouge prison, the museum reveals the darkest secrets of Pol Pot’s regime in stomach-churning detail, and doesn’t leave visitors with much of an appetite. Though not for the faint-hearted, both the Tuol Sleng and the Killing Fields memorial give visitors an important glimpse of Cambodian history and an appreciation for how far the country and its people have come in the last 30 years. Meandering on foot through the back streets of Phnom Penh with visions of icy-cold drinks on my mind, I spy a sign advertising “Massage By Blind” on a quiet street a block away from the congested riverfront promenade. Intrigued, I step inside and discover a tiny oasis that promises—and delivers—a never-to-be-forgotten-because-it’s-that-good shiatsu massage ($4/per hour). After changing into fresh cotton pajamas, I’m handed over to Sophan, my amazing masseur, who kneads the knots out of my body while I drift into a blissful state bordering on ecstasy. Next time, I think to myself, I’m staying for three hours. Cambodia’s best kept secret is, arguably, its sparkling, white-sand coastline. Glistening beneath the blazing sun a four-hour bus ride away from Phnom Penh (on surprisingly well-maintained roads), sits the seaside jewel of Sihanoukville, a laid-back paradise for travelers recovering from temple burnout. With its winning combination of restaurants, guesthouses, bars, and beaches, the little resort rivals those in neighboring Thailand, but without the backpacking hoards and attendant non-stop party atmosphere. Veg visitors will discover a delicious oasis in Sihanoukville. Whatever your heart—or stomach—fancies, you’ll find here, be it banana pancakes with maple syrup, perfectly cooked French fries, fish-free sushi, or a tall glass of fresh-squeezed pineapple juice. And if it’s not on the menu, it can’t hurt to ask; Cambodians are not only hospitable, but ingenious when it comes to kitchen chemistry. Best of all, there’s no need to leave the beach when hunger hits. Cafés and restaurants line the conifer-hemmed shore, luring the hungry with savory smells, creative menus, and, in the evenings, candle-lit ambiance backed by a reggae soundtrack. From my comfy lounge chair positioned beneath a rented umbrella ($1/day) at Occheuteal Beach, I survey the blue-green water, taking notice of a small boat as it sets off toward the small islands that dot the horizon. In the foreground, women in wide-brim hats ply the beach offering manicures and pedicures ($2), snacks, hair removal by string (really), and massage. Setting my novel aside, I consider buying a young coconut from a roaming fruit seller, but instead, I heed the call of the sea and dive into the tepid surf. Helpful Khmer Phrases

The organization has created a free lesson plan for educators encouraging them to apply Dr. King’s non-violent work to animal-protection issues while presenting peaceful ways to influence businesses and the government to not exploit animals. Ideas include urging students to write letters to companies asking them to forgo testing chemicals on animals, and educate friends and family about animals’ abilities, habitats, and social behavior.

Published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, the study surveyed 171 men and women aged 50 years and older and found that increasing one’s intake of fruits and vegetables actually decreases the amount of calcium leached from the bones. When the subjects increased their consumption of meat, the body became more acidic, causing the amount of calcium excretion to increase. How’s that for an answer? "

INTERVIEW WITH ERICA MEIER ON LIGHTLIFE FOODS’ VEGAN LINE,https://vegnews.com/2009/1/interview-with-erica-meier-on-lightlife-foods-vegan-line,"JANUARY 10, 2009","The recent announcement that Lightlife Foods has committed to using 166,000 fewer eggs in its line and will be coming out with three new, completely vegan products this spring is some of the best news we’ve heard all year. While it’s easy to see producers of veg goods as faceless corporations, it’s important to realize the possibility for real change to take place. To find out exactly how these victories are won—and what each of us can do to help—VegNews chatted with Erica Meier, the executive director of Compassion Over Killing, who worked with Lightlife on this campaign. VegNews: How long did you work with Lightlife on this effort? Erica Meier: After we announced in December 2007 that Morningstar Farms committed to reducing its use of eggs, we immediately began reaching out to other companies, including Lightlife Foods, asking them to move in the same direction—decreasing their use of eggs and increasing their vegan options. Lightlife Foods was responsive from the get-go, and we maintained a positive relationship with the company throughout the year. VN: Morningstar Farms similarly committed to using one million fewer eggs per year beginning in 2008. Is there hope that Lightlife will decide to make a similarly large reduction? EM: Morningstar Farms offered far more items that included eggs than Lightlife, so Morningstar was in a position to decrease its egg usage by a greater amount. We’re thrilled that both companies have committed to reducing their use of eggs while also introducing three new vegan products this spring. This is a very positive movement, and we hope to see even greater reductions in egg usage in the future, as more egg-free items enter the marketplace. VN: What is the most effective way for consumers—aside from not buying animal products—to convince companies to offer more vegan options? EM: Vegans should regularly contact companies and ask them to stop using eggs and other animal products. Few people ever take the time to contact companies with courteous suggestions for improvement, so those of us who do have a far greater impact than most consumers. It’s good to be vegan, but it’s even better to be an effective vegan activist. VN: Are veg companies moving more toward veganism than they have in the past? EM: The more [that we] vegans represent ourselves in a positive and mainstream fashion, the faster that transition will take place. In the last few decades, we’ve already seen vegan eating make significant movement from the margins closer into the mainstream. Just look at the increased availability of meat-free items in grocery stores everywhere, or even the fact that cultural icons such as Oprah and Ellen are helping to make vegan eating more societally acceptable and normal. Thanks in part to the increasing media spotlight on factory-farming cruelties, in the next decade, we’re going to see vegan eating continue to rise. In order to broaden the marketability of their foods, companies like Lightlife Foods and Morningstar Farms are—and will need to continue—shifting their vegetarian product lines to vegan. VN: Can you approximate how many hens this reduction will affect? EM: It’s tough to put an exact number on it, because the ripple effects of these types of victories are difficult to tangibly measure, but more than 500 fewer hens will be exploited as a result of this one decision by Lightlife alone.

VEGAN ACTIVISTS BELOVED BINGE,https://vegnews.com/2009/1/vegan-activists-beloved-binge,"JANUARY 10, 2009","“You can’t just be an activist if you’re going to survive long-term. I think you really need to nurture your other interests as well, so you can be a whole person,” says Vlachos. Thankfully for the animals, Vlachos’ “other interests” are interviewing people about why they eat meat, then screening the resulting documentary at colleges across the North America. Since its release in January of 2008, Seeing Through the Fence—which melds interviews with Vlachos’ family and community members, investigative footage, and expert testimony—has been shown before dozens of audiences. “I’ve screened with environmental groups and now I’ve started scheduling screenings through philosophy clubs. In some cases I’m going to be speaking in front of 75 to 100 philosophy students so I’m trying to bring it to a large, non-veg audience.” Focusing on the college-campus circuit, Gilbride leaflets while Vlachos books their next gig. Part of the attraction to working around campuses is the potential to get people going veg as early as possible. “[Students] are young and more open, and they have a long life of potential meat-eating or not-meat-eating ahead of them,” says Vlachos.

The long-locked, 34-year-old musician ditched meat and dairy after reading Dr. Joel Fuhrman’s Eat to Live—a book promoting the health benefits of a plant-based diet—to find a regime dedicated to disease prevention and weight loss. Morissette recently voiced her lifestyle change to OK!

The demand for milk products is about to turn sour after many years of a growing appetite for dairy. Amid the economic meltdown and credit crunch, dairy farmers are finding it harder to operate production on such a tight budget. While some consumers may enjoy today’s relatively low milk prices, costs are bound to rise if farmers are forced to scale back on production to cut costs, driving prices back up. Cross your fingers for a final jump to soy, almond, and hemp milk, all healthier and more environmentally friendly than the bovine version. "

As a company, we do not support Michael Vick in any way,” explained company spokeswoman Barbara Tucker. Apparently, Vick’s jersey number (#7) isn’t so lucky after all. "
VEG DIET BOOSTS REMISSION,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/veg-diet-boosts-remission,"DECEMBER 16, 2008","Breast-cancer survivors can be more hopeful today thanks to new information about the disease and diet. According to a just-released study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, breast-cancer survivors cut their risk of recurrence by approximately 31 percent by consuming a diet heavy in fruits, vegetables, and fiber. Researchers found that eating plant-based foods can reduce estrogen levels in the body, a key factor in the development of breast cancer. Given the innumerable studies published over the years touting the benefits of a vegetarian diet, it’s clear that most everyone would benefit by eating more fruits and vegetables. "
MCCARTNEY CRITICIZES DALAI LAMA,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/mccartney-criticizes-dalai-lama,"DECEMBER 15, 2008","Sir Paul McCartney recently lashed out at the Dalai Lama on his controversial fleshy diet. In a letter to the spiritual leader, the former Beatle pointed out that meat-eating contributes to the suffering of animals, which goes against the Buddhist tenet of never causing harm to a sentient being. According to reports, McCartney received a polite response from the Dalai Lama saying that his doctors had suggested he eat meat for health reasons. Although we know vegetarians worldwide are thriving on a plant-based diet, the Dalai Lama eating meat seems to negate everything Buddhism stands for. "
PORTLAND’S VEGAN MINI-MALL,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/portlands-vegan-mini-mall,"DECEMBER 15, 2008","In November, when nouveau-vegetarian restaurant Nutshell closed its doors for good, Portland, Oregon, lost a bit of its vegan cool. Filling the gap left in the vegan scene, however, is the city’s über-awesome vegan mini mall. While the economic downturn has affected business at the City of Roses’ meat-free oasis, Herbivore Clothing Company, Food Fight Grocery, Scapegoat Tattoo, and Sweet Pea Baking Company are keeping the dream alive, welcoming locals and out-of-towners alike who want to support vegan-owned businesses, and get a tattoo with their cupcake. Earlier this year, we spoke with Portland’s hippest entrepreneurs about what it’s like to be retail renegades. VegNews: Your new space is huge! What does that mean for shoppers? Josh Hooten, Herbivore: We’re going to carry all the usual goods: clothing, magazines, and books, and we’ll also have a huge selection of vegan cookbooks, and AR books, as well as belts, wallets, bags, zines, patches, art, buttons, stickers, aprons, and other stuff we haven’t figured out yet. Our space is plenty big now so we can add new stock frequently! VN: You all had successful stand-alone vegan businesses before. What sparked the inspiration for this project? Lisa Higgins, Sweet Pea Baking Company: Probably Chad’s over-active imagination originally. We had all been talking about moving our businesses together for the last year or so. My bakery finally got to the point where I had to have my own retail space and kitchen, and the timing just worked out for everyone. Chad Miller, Food Fight Grocery: We were all friends and had always thought it would be nice to hang out next door to each other all day. Brian Wilson, Scapegoat Tattoo: And, I know that Chad and I were kind of unhappy in our existing location. We were down in a hole, you could only see us from one direction, and just a little past the “cool” part of Portland. And then one day, it stuck. Then BOOM! We’re looking at a building. Then, Oh dang! We have a building! CM: Plus, the idea of an AR community center seemed necessary and like it could provide a nice example to the rest of the country as to what is possible to do in other communities. VN: Why do you think Portland is the perfect place for a retail experiment like this? CM: I think it’s pretty affordable, supportive of small businesses, and there are butt-loads of vegans and people who give a crap. BW: And it has a young mindset. When I opened my shop next to Food Fight, it was because I wanted to be a part of a community, not just another tattoo shop, and not just another vegan business. It was kind of a statement. Like, hey, even our tattoos are vegan. Portland’s vegan scene is unrivaled. VN: What kind of response have you been getting from customers? JH: People are very excited. People are really happy we’re more centrally located and have more space, you can come in and wander around, hang out, sit down and relax for a while. There’s a lot more to look at! BW: Our customers are very excited for us, too. It’s a little different for Scapegoat because not all of our customers are vegan, but we’ve had a good amount of converts in our two years just from people asking us questions when they’re getting tattooed. And now they can get some post-tattoo vegan comfort food right next door to help to show that we’re not missing out on anything! Visit the world’s first vegan mini-mall at 12th and Stark, in SE Portland. "
RECYCLING PROGRAMS CUT BACK,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/recycling-programs-cut-back,"DECEMBER 12, 2008","The faltering economy has taken aim at yet another victim: the recycling industry. Cardboard, plastic, paper, and metals once garnered reasonable prices for their use in electronics, auto parts, and even books. With the word “recession” being thrown around like a football, the goods have now been deemed worthless. Recycling warehouses have been unable to sell the materials for reasonable prices, leading contractors to ship the waste to landfills. Across the country, recycling programs are cutting back or shutting down altogether, posing an environmental problem linked directly to the current economic downturn. "
LUSH DISCONTINUES HARMFUL SULFATES,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/lush-discontinues-harmful-sulfates,"DECEMBER 12, 2008","In response to customer feedback, LUSH cosmetic company has eliminated the use of sodium laurel sulfates (SLS) in the majority of its solid shampoos. The brand, known for its natural handmade products, eco-friendly packaging, and commitment to veg-friendly cosmetics, has replaced the harmful surfactant with gentler sodium coco-sulfate. SLS has been linked to numerous health issues, including eye damage, and traces of the harsh chemical have also been found in the lungs and other vital organs. LUSH says that sodium coco-sulfate can replace SLS in some products, but not all. LUSH representative Jen O’Holla said, “LUSH only uses synthetics minimally and when absolutely necessary to create an effective product.” The company continues to search for natural alternatives to replace the remaining use of SLS. "
BULGARIA SIGNS HUMANE CONTRACT,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/bulgaria-signs-humane-contract,"DECEMBER 12, 2008","Bulgaria recently became the first country in the European Union to sign a contract mandating the humane treatment of animals. Four Paws Foundation, an international non-governmental organization, joined forces with agriculture minister, Valery Tsvetanov, to protect the country’s animal population. Four Paws President Helmut Dungler signed the contract that will foster future protections, similar to the foundation’s past work. One of their most well-known projects, the operation of the Dancing Bears Park, provides land for rescued “dancing bears.” An illegal but widespread form of inhumane treatment forces bear cubs to dance on hot plates while music is played, training them to “dance” when specific music is cued. Four Paws opened the sanctuary in 2000, and continues to be a pioneer in Bulgarian animal rights. "
FACTORY FARMS’ TOXIC EMISSIONS,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/factory-farms-toxic-emissions,"DECEMBER 11, 2008","As if factory farms weren’t horrific enough, a new report outlines the environmental destruction caused by massive chicken operations throughout the US. According to the Environmental Integrity Project, a national program formed by employees of the EPA angered by the Bush administration, chicken farms in ten states last year released an estimated 481.7 million pounds of toxic ammonia emissions. The amount is particularly significant because it is more than eight times the combined total from industrial sources such as steel mills and refineries, some of the most widely known culprits of environmental destruction. At high concentrations, ammonia emissions affect air quality and can cause respiratory irritation and lung damage. The message is clearer than ever: Going veg is good for your health and the planet.

OBAMA APPOINTS GREEN TEAM,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/obama-appoints-green-team,"DECEMBER 11, 2008","Soon-to-be-prez Barack Obama has not wasted any time pulling together an agenda for a greener future, and yesterday was no different. Mr. President-elect appointed a green quartet including Steven Chu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as Secretary of Energy; Carol Browner, who headed up the EPA under President Bill Clinton, as a new “energy czar”; Lisa Jackson, a former environmental-policy official in New Jersey, as the EPA administrator; and lastly, Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Nancy Sutley as the chairwoman of the President’s Council on Environmental Quality. Let’s hope these eco officials cement some real changes into America’s framework before it’s too late. "
NEW ZEALAND’S VEG DIET,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/new-zealands-veg-diet,"DECEMBER 9, 2008","Although the news may not have been welcome, president of the US-based Physicians for Responsible Medicine laid it on the line for New Zealanders. In a country where nearly 176,000 people have diabetes, Dr. Neal Barnard suggested overhauling a meat-and-dairy centered diet be the first step in combating the deadly disease. “The low-fat vegan diet is more effective at treating diabetes than the typical diet or oral medications,” he said in an address at Victoria University. With the dramatic increase in adult-onset diabetes due to unhealthy eating habits in affluent countries, people are slowly starting to replace standard meat-based fare with vegetarian foods. "
CONTAMINATED PORK IN IRELAND,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/contaminated-pork-in-ireland,"DECEMBER 9, 2008","Pork definitely won’t make grocery lists in Ireland this month, as the country has issued an international warning on contaminated pork produced in the Emerald Isle. The government released the warning after finding dioxins—naturally occurring chemical contaminants that can enter an animal’s system through food or the environment—in pigs and pig feed. Ingesting dioxins in sufficient volume over time has been linked to an increased risk of cancer in humans. In Ireland, swapping pork for potatoes is looking better every day. "

Obama said the issue is a “matter of urgency” as he talked with the green “Goracle” about the country’s future energy policies. The prez-to-be also told reporters that “all three of us are in agreement that the time for delay is over, the time for denial is over.” The denial may be waning, but we hope they’ll recognize the impact of meat-eating on the planet and drop the steak knife.

At $250 a pair, Portman started the collection in February 2007 with hopes of creating a stylish and sustainable alternative to the animal-free plastic and canvas shoes so widely available. According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, the demise of small boutiques like Te Casan is happening across the US—about 6,100 store closings are expected in 2008, up from 4,603 in 2007.

The vegan entrepreneur plans on expanding his ice-cream shop into a full-service café complete with vegan sandwiches, salads, soups, baked goods, and teas. Ironically, the Travel Channel’s meat-loving foodie and host Anthony Bourdain inspired Wheeler’s recent endeavor. “[The expansion] was sort of my giving [Bourdain] and other people who have that perception [that vegan food sucks] the finger,” Wheeler told the Boston Herald. “We’re not sitting around eating dirt and twigs.” Save us a seat, Wheeler.

With hopes of stimulating the economy while doing good for the environment, a new package has been proposed by the President-elect and Congressional leaders that is packed with eco-friendly initiatives. An estimated 2.5 million green jobs are to be created with the package in areas from mass transit to alternative power. Expected to cost between $400 billion to $500 billion, the plan awaits the signature of the new president on January 20. "
LEONIA LEWIS SETS RECORD,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/leonia-lewis-sets-record,"DECEMBER 7, 2008","Grammy-nominated singer and veg-darling Leona Lewis’ latest single set the record for fastest-selling digital track in the UK. Nearly 70,000 downloads in the first two days place her single, a cover of Snow Patrol’s “Run,” at number one. Prior to Lewis, the record was held by Estelle’s “American Boy” with 51,857 downloads in a week. Lewis, PETA’s 2008 Sexiest Vegetarian, also holds honors with her previous single “Bleeding Love,” iTune’s most popular track of the year.

METHANE MADE INTO ELECTRICITY,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/methane-made-into-electricity,"DECEMBER 7, 2008","A group of farmers in the Netherlands have gotten creative in their attempt to solve agriculture’s environmental problem. To counter the greenhouse gases of 3,000 pigs, farmers cook manure, capture the released methane, and convert it into electricity. A rare attempt at environmental consciousness among livestock farmers, their efforts are still not enough to combat the vast environmental consequences of the industry. Regardless, this technique, called “methane capture,” and other high-tech solutions are being explored worldwide. Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agrees with the vegetarian community: people must eat less meat to control their carbon footprints. "
MELAMINE FOUND IN ORGANIC FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/melamine-found-in-organic-food,"DECEMBER 7, 2008","Melamine, the chemical responsible for last year’s horrific pet food and baby formula recall, was recently discovered in France’s organic food supply—namely, chicken feed. A high level of the chemical, which is added to food to boost protein levels, was found in 300 tons of organic soymeal. While the tested batch was quickly recalled, another 127 untested tons were delivered to organic farms across the country. Scientists reassure the public that melamine is not feasibly passed through the food chain, but there is no definitive evidence to prove its harmlessness to humans. Organic farms, once hailed by omnivores as the healthier option, are not entirely safe from the dangerous chemical additives polluting the food system. "

CHEMICAL-FREE GREEN CLEANING,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/chemical-free-green-cleaning,"DECEMBER 6, 2008","With friends, family, carolers, coworkers, and anyone else you see fit to invite over for a homey holiday soirée likely to be traipsing their way through your abode, ‘tis the season for a nice, deep cleaning. Of course, there’s nothing merry nor bright about exposing yourself or your guests to harsh cleaning chemicals. To keep your holiday lounge—aka your living room—spic and span without fear of needing to break out your hazmat suit, stick to chemical-free cleaners. Since time is of the essence when there are cookies to decorate, popcorn to string, and snowballs to throw, cleaning with all-natural ingredients is key not only for your health, but for your stopwatch as well. Making a trip to your cupboard for the requisite ingredients is definitely going to be easier than fighting your way through the holiday throngs that await you at the grocery store. With these three simple cleaners, your guests’ eyes will only twinkle with happiness, not chemical irritation. Lemon Juice
Like vinegar, lemon juice derives its cleaning power from its powerful, naturally acidic properties. Want to experiment? Soak an old penny in lemon juice and watch the grime and tarnish dissolve and the original sparkle and shine return. Lemon juice provides some antibacterial and antiseptic properties for cleaning and gives off a clean, natural scent.
TIP: Commercial sprays build up over time and dull wood furniture’s sheen. Mix one cup of olive oil with one half cup of lemon juice for shine without waxy build up. Baking Soda
Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, is a non-toxic, non-polluting, inexpensive product that can work wonders in your home. Sodium bicarbonate is a naturally occurring substance that is found in all living things, and its unique property is that it helps regulate PH balance. It is especially good at neutralizing odors.
TIP: Baking soda can be added with your liquid detergent to up the cleaning quotient in a load of laundry, and can also be used as a fabric softener/deodorizer during the rinse cycle. Vinegar
Vinegar is another readily available, inexpensive, non-toxic and biodegradable product with multiple uses. It has natural antibacterial properties and makes a powerful cleanser. Many of the cleaning agents added to today’s over-the-counter products can be carcinogenic with exposure over time. After all, our environment is host to pollutants whose dissemination we have no control over. Why not exert control where we can? Still shy about vinegar? No, your house is not going to smell like salad—the strong smell of vinegar vanishes when your cleaning solution dries.
TIP: Straight vinegar works great for cleaning the bathtub and works miracles on the toilet bowl. Buy the inexpensive stuff in gallon jugs and skip the balsamic or flavored varieties! "

TOXINS FOUND IN TOYS,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/toxins-found-in-toys,"DECEMBER 4, 2008","Toy manufacturers have been toying around with American consumers, putting children’s health at risk. The non-profit organization, Ecology Center, along with other partners across the country, has released a consumer guide to toxic toys (available on healthytoys.org). Researchers tested more than 1,500 popular children’s toys for lead, cadmium, arsenic, and PVC and found that one in three contained medium or high levels of harmful chemicals. The Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations, which go into effect February 2009, would make certain products on the shelf this holiday season illegal to sell two months from now.

MEATLESS MEALS INCREASE,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/meatless-meals-increase,"DECEMBER 4, 2008","The animal agribusiness machine may have a steak in restaurants, but it’s only a matter of time before their bread and butter becomes the next side dish. According to Restaurants & Institutions (R&I), a leading source of food and business-trend research, nearly one-quarter of Americans sometimes opt for meatless dishes at restaurants. To bolster the company’s claim, Harris Interactive conducted a poll finding that 3.2 percent of Americans, or 7.3 million people, identify themselves as vegetarians. The same study found that 10 percent of consumers largely follow vegetarian-inclined diets and 5 percent more are “definitely interested” in the shift to a vegetarian-based diet. Soy steak, anyone? "
BROADWAY GOES GREEN,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/broadway-goes-green,"DECEMBER 1, 2008","The lights in New York City’s famed theater district will be brighter than ever, in a good way. In an effort called Broadway Goes Green, the city has joined forces with local theaters to outline sustainable goals to decrease the area’s impact on the city’s overburdened electrical grid. The green makeover includes washing costumes with eco-friendly detergent, using low-watt compact-florescent bulbs, reducing paper usage, opting for more efficient air-conditioning systems, and limiting fuel-guzzling transportation when touring. If Broadway can go green, maybe there’s hope for Las Vegas to turn off a few of its lights. "

California food experts met to discuss ideas connecting the city with its “foodshed”—a 100- to 200-mile radius of farmland around San Francisco—in hopes of bringing healthy, sustainable meals from regional farmlands into the city instead of relying on imported goods. The program is meant to provide high-quality food to low-income residents normally dependent on government meals, but it sounds like a good idea for all of us. "
GREENING THE WHITE HOUSE,https://vegnews.com/2008/12/greening-the-white-house,"DECEMBER 1, 2008","President-elect Barack Obama plans to out-do Jimmy Carter’s solar panels with a White House makeover.

INTERVIEW WITH MOBY,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/interview-with-moby,"NOVEMBER 30, 2008","For Grammy-nominated, platinum-selling artist Moby, 2008 was a good year. Not only did he release yet another studio album—“Last Night”—and perform on stages around the globe, but he also made a guest appearance in the pages of VegNews Magazine. Here, the superstar vegan talks music, politics, and what surprises lurk in his personal music collection. VN: As outspoken as you are, and despite your punk-rock background, your lyrics seem apolitical and secondary to your instrumentals.
M: I’ve always wanted to write more issue-oriented music, but the truth is, whenever I’ve tried, I’ve never been very good at it. A lot of my heroes have written fantastic issue-oriented music—whether it was Public Enemy or Joe Strummer or Neil Young—but whenever I’ve tried to write political music, it’s just way too strident and too didactic. That’s why I’ve adopted this almost church-and-state separation where the music I make is personal and mood-driven, and then when I write essays or do interviews I tend to be more issue-oriented. VN: What do you think of the view that the adoption and promotion of veganism is the most important form of activism an animal advocate can undertake?
M: Certainly, if the entire world decided to become vegan tomorrow, a whole host of the world’s problems would disappear overnight. Climate change would decrease by 25 percent, deforestation would cease, rainforests would be preserved, our water- and air-quality would increase, life-expectancy rates would increase, and our rates of cancer would plummet, so certainly, with that one action of becoming vegan you are quite effectively making the world a better place. VN: The world has become more accepting of the vegan diet—indeed, in many parts of the world, it is trendy. Does this represent a truly radical change in people’s attitude toward animals?
M: Factory-farm lobbyists are so powerful and so well funded and they do everything in their power to hide the truth about farming. They keep the farms and slaughterhouses in places that most people never visit; they execute huge marketing campaigns in an effort to make animal production look like a happy, nice, benign institution. But, at the same time, when I was a vegan 15 or 20 years ago, it was a lot more difficult. First of all, no one knew what the word “vegan” meant and there weren’t very many [vegetarian] restaurants. When it came to traveling it was especially hard, but now almost every decent-sized city has health-food stores and vegetarian restaurants; people do seem a lot more receptive to the notion of someone being a vegan now than they were 20 years ago. VN: Of your own collection of CDs, tapes, and records, what would our readers be most surprised to discover?
M: Musically, I like just about everything. I would say people would be surprised to learn about the majority of music that I own. I have some cool, credible records, but I also have Neil Diamond and Rod Stewart’s greatest hits. If the truth be told, I find myself listening to Neil Diamond and Rod Stewart way more than I find myself listening to cool independent indie rock from Williamsburg. VN: If you went to a karaoke bar with friends, what song would you sing?
M: Well I’m not such a good singer; I’d be tempted to do “Livin’ On A Prayer” by Bon Jovi. "
CRUELTY-FREE CANDLES,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/cruelty-free-candles,"NOVEMBER 30, 2008","When the days grow shorter and the dark of night begins its wintry reign, you know the signal to cozy-up your living space and create a nurturing environment has been officially sounded. A key ingredient in this process is the addition of candles. They provide ambience at dinner parties, set the mood for romantic evenings at home, and even play a role in our spiritual lives, giving our personal spaces a warm, peaceful glow. They smell good, look good, and cast a snuggly light that begs for you to whip up a cup of hot cocoa and settle in for the night. Best of all, today’s cruelty-free, alternative-wax candles support our desire to live compassionately while keeping the home fires burning with a cozy warmth. The Joy of Soy (Candles)
Most candles are made with paraffin—a petroleum waste-product. When burned, paraffin releases carcinogenic toxins like benzene and soot into the air, which, in addition to being dangerous for your lungs (and your animal companion’s lungs), can settle on furniture and countertops, damaging surfaces. A better bet for a soot-free home is soy. That’s right: The mighty soybean that yields so many health benefits also lends itself to candles. Natural soy-wax candles are not only healthier for the environment, but more economical, too, because they burn up to 50-percent longer than their paraffin counterparts. (Bay)Berry Good
Mother Nature has generously supplied us with another natural source of cruelty-free candle wax in the bayberry. You could call bayberry the “patriotic alternative to paraffin,” since colonial Americans were the first to transform the teensy little berry into candle wax. Today, as in the past, bayberry candles enjoy extra popularity around the holidays, when they are burned to bring good luck for the coming year. When scouting for these special candles, be sure the wax consists of pure bayberry (a pleasant, delicate fragrance on its own) and not artificially scented paraffin wax. Bee-Free
My quest for cruelty-free candles made from renewable resources brought me to an unexpected source: palm wax. Like olive oil, palm wax oil is a “virgin” oil that doesn’t require refining—just a bit of filtering and deodorizing. Shaped from the fruit of the oil palm, palm wax candles also burn clean and last longer than those made with paraffin, and are a fabulous alternative to beeswax—the production of which usually involves drug and pesticide treatments, genetic tampering, wing clipping, and the use of manufactured pheromones. There’s nothing natural about that. Once you’ve made the choice to bring natural-wax candles into your home, be sure any added fragrance is pure, essential oil—otherwise your good intentions will go literally up in smoke as harmful by-products from artificial scents are released into the air. There is no denying the magic of candlelight. With a little detective work, you can enjoy the beauty and comfort of candles while keeping your home cruelty- and toxin-free. Candle-buying Guide

INTERVIEW WITH MIRA TWETI,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/interview-with-mira-tweti,"NOVEMBER 30, 2008","Award-winning journalist, book author, filmmaker, and vegan Mira Tweti has a lot to be thankful for this holiday season. In 2008, Tweti published two books on a topic close to her heart—parrots—and her latest film project, Little Miss Dewie: a Duckumentary, was accepted into nine prestigious film festivals. While traversing North America promoting her projects, Tweti took a moment to speak with VegNews about ducks, vegetarianism, and, of course, Thanksgiving. VegNews: Who is Little Miss Dewie?
Mira Tweti: Dewie is a duck bred for egg-laying that ended up as someone’s pet. She was abandoned at just a few weeks old, left in the lagoon in front of my apartment building in Playa del Rey, Calif. The people who had her may have thought it was a great place to leave her because there are wild ducks here, but it was actually a death sentence. I found her starved and stinking of urine. VN: How is Little Miss Dewie’s story emblematic of the billions of birds killed for food each year?
MT: If she hadn’t been sold as a pet, she’d likely have been confined in a small cage like an egg-laying chicken or crammed with other females in an over-packed concrete duck house. The most popular pet ducklings are Pekins. White like Dewie, they are bred for meat and grow so large they dwarf any species of wild duck in nature. They commonly run into serious health problems when they live longer in homes than they would in a factory farm. Even as backyard pets, factory-farmed ducks and geese are plagued with the repercussions of the compromises humans have wrought on their species. VN: What has been the most rewarding experience for you while promoting your film?
MT: Movie Magazine film reviewer Joan Widdifield said a lot of wonderful things about the film, but the one that meant the most and validated making it was, “When I watched Little Miss Dewie with my sister Elin, she said quietly, ‘I’ll never eat duck again.’ That?s the effect that Dewie has.” VN: When and how did you become vegetarian?
MT: One day six years ago my parrot was walking around on the dining table while I ate chicken for lunch. For some reason, I had a moment of clarity and made a heart connection with what was on my plate. I’d known intellectually that it was morally wrong to take the life of another sentient being, but that day I realized that the bird on my plate was no different from the one I loved and pampered as a member of my family. VN: How will you celebrate Thanksgiving?
MT: I’ll be at the annual Vegan Picnic at the park in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles. Everyone brings a vegan dish. There’s a table or two with entrées, one for appetizers, another for desserts. The last couple of years there’s been a raw-food table, too. Everyone there is cognizant of the suffering of the holiday but each year more people show up. It’s giving thanks with every taste and in every moment through the day. "

TOFURKY SALES INCREASE,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/tofurky-sales-increase,"NOVEMBER 26, 2008","Today’s the day turkey and Tofurky compete as the dinner-table centerpiece around the country.

Thanks to Turtle Islands Foods, 275,634 of its signature Tofurky roasts were sold in the United States, a 37 percent increase over 2006 sales. In spite of the floundering economy, the company projects its 2008 revenues to grow by around 20 percent over last year’s record sales.

ALARMING ANIMAL FOOD ADDITIVES,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/alarming-animal-food-additives,"NOVEMBER 25, 2008","The holidays are officially here, and that means one thing: mystery dishes at family dinners. Even the most well-intentioned auntie can unwittingly sneak animal-derived ingredients into your meal. Why? Not out of malice, of course, but with all the myriad names that cloak the origins of additives, even savvy longtime vegans can get lost in the technical mumbo jumbo. As herbivores, we have made it our daily business to make informed food choices and question the status quo when it comes to packaged foods. We read every line of the nutrition-facts box on the back of our favorite products and try to comprehend each ingredient. We want—no, we need—to know exactly what pre-gelatinized wheat starch is, where it comes from, and if it fits into our food philosophy. Of course, preparing everything from scratch is the best way to know what, precisely, is going in your dinner. But for times when there are potlucks aplenty to attend, food for the masses to be made, and the distinct chance that you?ll be sampling someone else’s culinary creations, keeping track of each and every ingredient can be just about impossible. Not to mention the fact that maybe, just maybe, this time of year is when some of us who would normally double-sift our flours might take a little help from a pre-packaged mix or two. To help make sure your eats are as ethical as you are, keep this list of sneaky, animal-based ingredients handy for when Aunt Gladys asks what, exactly, it is that you don’t eat, for the 500th time.

FOIE GRAS FIGHT,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/foie-gras-fight,"NOVEMBER 25, 2008","In 2006, the Chicago City Council passed an ordinance—against the objections of Mayor Richard Daley and the Illinois Restaurant association—to make the Windy City the first in the US to ban the sale of foie gras. Animal advocates embraced the new law as an historic step toward more humane eating in a major American metropolis, and it enjoyed widespread public support. Yet, just two years later, the Council suddenly rescinded their decision without any debate or deliberation, again legalizing foie gras and all the cruelty entailed in force-feeding ducks and geese to harvest their bloated, diseased livers. In 2004, thanks to undercover video footage obtained by investigative activists, the force-feeding controversy first hit the headlines. Protests at restaurants around the country caused many to drop the dreadful delicacy from their menus, whether they were afraid of losing business or agreed that force-feeding constitutes cruel and unnatural torture. A law to ban foie gras throughout California by 2012 had been passed, and legislation was pending in other cities and states. Having sat frozen in committee for more than a year, the swiftly enacted Chicago repeal came as a surprise to many. Activists only learned of the vote less than 24 hours before it took place. By the time concerned Chicagoans contacted their aldermen, most of them were already at City Hall. Alderman Tom Tunney (former chair of the Illinois Restaurant association and a local restaurateur) successfully employed an arcane political maneuver usually reserved for non- controversial legislation that permits a Council member to move to “discharge” a matter from committee without a public hearing. Of the 48 aldermen who initially voted in favor of the ban, only six opposed the repeal. The Council’s reversal says a lot more about the well-greased gears that comprise the Daley political machine in Chicago than the issue of foie gras, but the outcome was a disappointing defeat for animal protection. Alderman Joe Moore first learned about the inherent cruelty of foie-gras production when newspapers reported that nationally known Chicago chef Charlie Trotter had decided to no longer serve the dish in his restaurants because it was inhumane. The sale and/or production of foie gras had already been banned in more than 15 countries, and momentum against it was building throughout the US when Moore introduced a proposal to the City Council to outlaw foie-gras sales in Chicago. “In the bigger picture, this will probably be just a small bump in the road for the larger international work to prohibit force-feeding and foie gras,” says Chicago-based activist Nathan Runkle. “Now, in Chicago and around the nation, we should keep focusing our grassroots efforts on convincing restaurants that they have more to lose than to gain by condoning this sort of horrific animal abuse, while continuing to promote veganism to society at large.” In recent years, 84 restaurants in Chicago and 217 in Illinois have pledged not to serve foie gras, with hundreds more around the country making the same commitment. Until the law protects animals from this torture, at least conscientious business-owners and consumers can continue to take a stand against the cruelty of force-feeding. Many progressive pockets around the world have already taken legislative action against foie gras:
California
Denmark
Finland
Germany
Israel
Norway
Poland
Sweden
Switzerland
Turkey
The United Kingdom "

MAD COW MEASURES QUESTIONED,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/mad-cow-measures-questioned,"NOVEMBER 21, 2008","FDA-developed guidelines to help eliminate mad cow disease are being called into question by industry officials. The regulations will prohibit cattle brains and spinal cords—the most high-risk tissue—from being rendered for animal feed. Officials are now concerned that farmers’ alternative methods of dealing with the deceased, whether burying on farm land or simply leaving the remains to compost, will cause contamination to soil and groundwater. The FDA’s aim is to prevent contaminated feed from being fed to pigs and chickens, which then could be rendered back into feed for cows.

When reporting the sickening behavior to supervisors, the undercover investigator was told, “Every once in a while, everybody gets agitated and has to kill a bird.” This mediocre reaction preceded new regulations for workers, according to reports.

ECO-FRIENDLY FLOWERS,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/eco-friendly-flowers,"NOVEMBER 17, 2008","We give flowers to console, to bring cheer, and to brighten our homes, but beyond the tissue paper and cellophane wrapping, there lurks a dark secret: the flower factory farm. Just like animal agriculture, the commercial flower industry is rife with scary production practices involving toxic chemicals, unfair labor practices, and excessive consumption of water and other precious natural resources. But for the savvy buyer, there are sweet-smelling, eco-friendly options, and nobody’s nose will know the difference. A Thorn in Our Sides
More than 70 percent of the world’s cut flowers are grown in South America, and more countries around the world are jumping on board to get their piece of the pie. To produce flowers quickly and cheaply, industrial flower farmers use massive amounts of carcinogenic pesticides and herbicides, using energy-consuming, growth-stimulating strategies. Heated greenhouses, intense fertilizers, growth hormones and artificial lighting are used to force flowers to grow faster and out of season. The resulting “McFlowers” are often grown in countries where stringent pesticide restrictions do not exist or are limited. In addition, because flowers are not consumed, they are not tested for pesticide residues, and there is no legal requirement to do so. Risky Business
Flower industry workers—predominately women—are poorly paid for their labor, which is often conducted without the benefit of protective clothing. More than 60 percent of workers from these communities suffer from pesticide-related illnesses including skin and respiratory problems, blurred vision, fatigue, and premature birth. Our environment also takes a heavy hit as the runoff from the noxious brew of fertilizers and chemicals washes off into surrounding streams, contaminating the plants and animals in that environment and threatening the health and vitality of many more innocent people besides the workers who are directly involved in flower production. Same-Day Delivery
The majority of flowers found in First World florist shops and grocery stores travel long distances from the Third World via fuel-guzzling cargo planes. They are kept at very cool temperatures and packed in buckets of water or with individual plastic water tubes on every stem to ensure they keep their “just picked” appearance. The energy burned to cool and ship these luxury items is, without question, taxing to the environment. Good News for Caring Consumers
Remember when we needed to take weekly field trips to the nearest co-op to find natural products, whereas now we can find chemical-free, unprocessed provisions just about anywhere? Like the natural foods market, the organic flower industry is beginning to bud, and it’s just a matter of time before it blooms, thanks to conscious consumers who raise awareness and create a demand. One way to support the sustainably produced flower industry and avoid waste generated from stay-fresh gadgets like disposable plastic tubes and other unnecessary packaging is to buy locally grown, in-season flowers. The next time you need a bouquet, check with your local farmers’ markets or natural food store to find environmentally produced flowers and plants. Non-traditional varieties such as lavender or sunflowers are often a good bet. A few major retailers are already offering organic flowers; Whole Foods has added organic roses and calla lilies to its floral department, and there are a handful of web-based retailers offering organically grown flowers for delivery. So, take time to stop and smell the roses, to give that graduation bouquet, and pin that corsage on your prom date—but for your health, that of other people, and for the environment, make sure they’re organic and chemical-free.

AGRIPROCESSORS SHUTS DOWN,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/agriprocessors-shuts-down,"NOVEMBER 16, 2008","Iowa-based Agriprocessors slaughterhouse officially filed for bankruptcy earlier this week, following almost $10 million in fines for violations of Iowa state labor laws—including illegal deductions from workers’ paychecks. Earlier this year, an immigration raid on the plant revealed illegal-immigrant minors—seven of whom were not even 16 years old—working in appalling conditions. For non-human animals, Agriprocessors has been a house of horrors, with trucks full of live chickens and turkeys having been reportedly abandoned in the parking lot and still-conscious animals being slaughtered.

WAIST SIZE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/waist-size-and-life-expectancy,"NOVEMBER 16, 2008","With Thanksgiving—aka the day of a thousand mashed potatoes—nearly here, now’s a particularly important time to remember to eat healthfully. In examining the results of a study that involved nearly 360,000 participants from nine countries in Europe, doctors have shown that with each increased inch in waist circumference, the likelihood of an early death rises. Interestingly, even people who had normal-range Body Mass Indexes but carried more weight around their middles showed the same increased risk as those whose BMIs were above average. Though vegetarians tend to be leaner than our non-veg counterparts, it’s still important to watch our waist’s weight. "
IMBRUGLIA PAIRS WITH PETA,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/imbruglia-pairs-with-peta,"NOVEMBER 16, 2008","Would you ever be caught dead wearing fur? Yeah, we didn’t think so. Turns out, you now officially have something in common with the ever-lovely Natalie Imbruglia, who recently paired with PETA for a fur-free campaign. Considering the horrific cruelty inherent in fur, it’s easily more shocking that anyone would continue to wear it than a celeb choosing to forgo the frightful fashion. Still, sales of fur increased in 2007 by more than ten percent, which only further proves why it’s important for those who oppose fur to speak out against it. "

Even though Gore says it’s a no-go, he made his first mistake as future czar in 2006 when conveniently forgetting the link between meat consumption and global warming in his cinematic brainchild, An Inconvenient Truth.

SOY FIGHTS HEART DISEASE,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/soy-fights-heart-disease,"NOVEMBER 13, 2008","The path to a healthier heart—and cleaner colon­—starts with soy.

The study examined the effect in individuals who had high versus normal blood cholesterol and found that the cholesterol-lowering effect of soy protein was significant in both groups. "

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy sonar use for anti-submarine training off the coast of Southern California despite the potentially harmful effects sonar pulses can have on underwater sea life. The court accepted the Navy’s argument that limiting anti-submarine training exercises posed a national security issue. Three justices did, however, vouch for the underdogs: “Sonar is linked to mass strandings of marine mammals, hemorrhaging around the brain and ears, and acute effects on the central nervous system as well as lesions in vital organs,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her dissent.

Owen Hoppe, owner of New Ethic Restaurant in the Old North End neighborhood, opened his new dining spot thanks to inspiration from the vegan band, Earth Crisis. The restaurant name, inspired by one of the band’s songs, serves only meat-free fare like Thai salad with a coconut-avocado dressing, a soul-food platter, and plantain burgers.

Obama’s environmental adviser, Jason Grumet, said the new prez will borrow initiatives already in place in Europe and some US states to control heat-trapping emissions. Next month, delegates from 190 countries will meet on the global-warming crisis in Poznan, Poland. It’s about time the environment moved to the front seat after years of riding bitch. "
BLOOMBERG BATTLES PLASTIC,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/bloomberg-battles-plastic,"NOVEMBER 11, 2008","Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently planned an attack on plastic bags in New York City with hopes of generating two green outcomes: money and a cleaner urban landscape. Bloomberg’s proposal calls for charging a 6-cent fee on plastic shopping bags, allocating one cent to store owners as an incentive to comply and the remainder to the city. If the initiative passes, as either a tax or fee, New York City would rake in approximately $16 million a year. "

The soon-to-be prez recently addressed the dog question at his first press conference as President Elect. “We have two criteria that have to be reconciled,” Obama said. “Malia is allergic, so [the dog] has to be hypoallergenic… On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog.” Obama wins points for his good-natured answer in the eyes of animal advocates everywhere.

GMO DEBATE,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/gmo-debate,"NOVEMBER 11, 2008","The line between vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism has become blurred due to the push for genetically-modified foods in India. More than 9,000 school and college students in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, launched a campaign to end GM trials on okra, cauliflower, cabbage, potato, and corn modified with animal genes. The plight against genetically modified foods not only helps re-establish true vegetarianism, but also ensures food safety for consumers concerned about the long-term effects. "

Ever consider that, by reading a diet book, thousands of people would choose vegetarianism? Well, in the last year—thanks to one activist in particular—all of these things actually happened. Rory Freedman—writer, activist, media darling, and meat-free icon—works non-stop to make the veg lifestyle appeal to the masses, and this year, they got the message. Company of the Year: Chicago Soydairy
By introducing Teese—the company’s dairy-free cheese that quickly garnered big-time buzz in the blogosphere—redesigning its website, and coming out with even more flavors of the already-popular Temptation ice cream, Chicago Soydairy is not only removing the barriers, but also redefining the accessibility of the veg lifestyle. Product of the Year: Dr. Cow Tree Nut Cheese
Here at VN, we test all kinds of new products, and by far, this one left the most lasting impression. Tangy, rich, and utterly decadent, the cheeses—made from cashew, hemp, and macadamia nuts—are easily the most exciting new products to grace our fridges this year. Whatever flavor launches next, we’ll be ready for it, crackers in one hand, wine glasses in the other. Book of the Year: Quantum Wellness
Beneath this mainstream hardcover is a vegan manifesto that encourages readers to consider the animals before tucking in to a plate loaded with dead ones. Kathy Freston’s Quantum Wellness served a 10-week stint on The New York Times bestseller list and has sold 210,000 copies, which can only be described as phenomenal in the world of vegan book sales. Event of the Year: NYC’s Veggie Pride Parade
The brainchild of The VivaVegie Society’s Pamela Rice (with a nudge from Paris, which has hosted its own Veggie Pride Parade since 2001), the march through the city’s meatpacking district attracted a costumed crowd of 600 and almost as many media mentions. Look for a second helping in 2009. Restaurant of the Year: Veggie Grill
In the eating-out ether, nestled between fine dining and fast food, lies an intriguing category that, until recently, wasn’t on most vegetarians’ radar: fast-casual. With the expanding Southern California Veggie Grill empire, that’s about to change. Delectable menu items include the Santa Fe Crispy Chickin’ sandwich and Sweetheart Fries with chipotle dipping sauce. Non-Profit of the Year: Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary
In 2004, Jenny Brown and her husband Doug Abel accepted their first rescued chickens at the newly minted Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary, and today care for a menagerie of 140 former food-production animals. “Woodstock has a hip vibe,” says Dan Piraro, a Woodstock board member. “Our aim is for the sanctuary to be a place where culture, compassion, natural beauty, and communion with our fellow creatures come together.” Trend of the Year: Veg Athletes
In 2007, Atlanta Hawks guard Salim Stoudamire came out of the (vegan) pantry, followed by Kansas City Chiefs all-star tight-end Tony Gonzalez. Next, it was two baseball players—Milwaukee Brewers all-star first baseman Prince Fielder and Minnesota Twins relief pitcher Pat Neshek—who both declared for the vegan fantasy league before the 2008 season. We’re still waiting for the first vegan ice hockey player. Sports fans know the mantra: Wait ‘til next year! Veg City Taking Over the World: Portland
This year, no metropolis has earned more bragging rights for its plant-based prowess than the über veg-friendly Portland, Oregon. Savor for a moment the sheer magnitude of this meat-free paradise: the world?s first vegan shopping mall, all-you-can-eat brunch at the Sweetpea Baking Company, cruelty-free cocktails at Bye and Bye, and cookies ‘n’ cream shakes at Sip’s milk-free milkshake cart. Dessert Epicenter of the Planet: NYC
Life is sweeter than ever in New York City. From root-beer-float cupcakes, chocolate-dipped s’mores, and pecan sticky buns, to towering peanut-butter-bomb cakes, brownie-topped cheesecakes, and frosting shots, New Yorkers take their vegan desserts very seriously. Cookbook of the Year: Great Chefs Cook Vegan
Beginning with a great idea and adding a pinch of self-confidence and a dash of bravado, author Linda Long coaxed the world’s master chefs—men and women accustomed to shucking oysters, boiling lobsters, and searing duck livers—into the vegan realm. How? By getting them to agree, in Great Chefs Cook Vegan, that food is as much about preparation and presentation as it is about taste. Buzz of the Year: Prop 2
Coupled with nationally broadcast undercover footage of diseased and abusive factory-farm and slaughterhouse conditions, Prop. 2 has garnered unprecedented attention to the abuses of the animal-agriculture industry. The measure, which goes into effect on January 1, 2015, prohibits three egregious farming practices regularly implemented at farms throughout California: gestation crates, battery cages, and veal crates. Ethical Style Icons: Chloé Jo Berman & Joshua Katcher
He’s a trend-setting vegan who grew up eating brisket, liver, and eggs, and she’s a foxy girl-about-town/animal activist who was raised in a progressive kosher household and recently went naked in protest of fur. If you don’t know the dichotomous duo by name, you will soon, because these two Big Apple-based purveyors of animal-loving-hipster cool are about to blow up—in all the right ways. Comeback of the Year: Sarah Kramer
After a three-year hiatus to star in “The Vagina Monologues” and run the family tattoo parlor, beloved vegan cookbook queen Sarah Kramer is making her comeback. Her newly released food and travel manifesto, Vegan à Go-Go!, will surely bring devotees to their knees: Kramer’s lovable personality, to-die-for recipes, and campy, retro-style photography ooze from the adorable pocket-sized book. Euro Import of the Year: Maoz Vegetarian
With a brand-new location in NYC, East Coasters have broadened their fast-food repertoire with Maoz’ mouthwatering, nourishing alternative to bean burritos and veggie burgers, loading their regular or whole-wheat pitas with all-you-can-pile-on vegan salad bar toppings and sauces. Stay tuned for new locations set to open in Florida and DC before the decade’s up, followed by Boston, LA, and San Francisco. Political Move of the Year: Kucinich’s Call to Impeach Bush
Formulating a refined list of the countless ways the American populace has been betrayed, former presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich introduced 35 specific articles of impeachment to Congress on June 9 of this year including manufacturing a case for the Iraq war, imprisoning children, rampant and unwarranted surveillance in violation of the fourth amendment, and negligent management of Hurricane Katrina. Year of Fancy Footwear
Up until now, very few companies have offered animal-friendly footwear that is not either of the unethically chic-and-cheap or responsible-and-drab varieties. Just this year, Gina Ferraraccio launched her understated, modern, and environmentally responsible vegan company Cri de Coeur, Natalie Portman introduced her brand-new line for Té Casan, and Bourgeois Boheme’s recently developed men’s line joined the ranks of high-end, animal-friendly standbys like NeuAura, Georgette, and Rina Shah. Best Vegan Infiltration of the Mainstream: Veg Advantage
What do New York University, Disney World, Yahoo, and AOL have in common? Veganism! That’s right, they’re all integrating vegan cuisine into their menus with the help of Veg Advantage, a food-brokering service that demonstrates veg food’s potential to mainstream clients by providing onsite cooking demos and consultations. Year of the Dog
Bow WOW! With dogged determination, the canine corner of the retail market made some serious leaps and bounds in 2008. You might have noticed a sub-economy of luxury dog salons; an all-you-can-eat buffet of vegan kibble options; grooming products fit for kings of the human variety; high-tech toys made with recycled, eco-friendly materials; and countless new books on pet-food politics, nutrition, and emotional wellbeing. Best Media Makeover: The New York Times
Maybe you remember last year, when we were somewhat displeased with the portrayal of vegetarianism by The New York Times. This year, we’re happy to report that the Times, they are a’ changin’. Beginning in January with Mark Bittman’s incisive “Rethinking the Meat Guzzler,” coverage of veg issues has been prevalent in the high-profile daily and, most importantly, positive. Year of the Coconut
This year, coconut is taking the dairy-free world by storm, and we couldn’t be happier. Turtle Mountain is taking over the sweet side of the spectrum with new lines of coconut-based yogurts and ice creams, and Coconut Bliss is matching them bite for icy-cold bite with its crazy-tasty frozen desserts. Meanwhile, a certain maker of popular faux-meat products is about to go live with a coconut-curry tempeh that we had the pleasure of taste-testing, and man, are you in for a treat! "

It’s a bit caveman.” "
VEG INSURANCE RATES,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/veg-insurance-rates,"NOVEMBER 10, 2008","PETA has asked BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont to lower insurance rates for vegetarians, who pose less of a health liability than meat-eaters. The animal-rights organization’s request was prompted by a recent outbreak of E.coli traced to tainted meat in Vermont.

BIG BUSINESS GOES GREEN,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/big-business-goes-green,"NOVEMBER 10, 2008","Several mainstream retailers around the country are opting for a blueprint with a greener hue. Wal-Mart stores, Chipotle, and McDonald’s have jumped on board the eco-friendly bandwagon by building environmentally conscious outlets. Experts assert the new stores target eco-conscious customers who want to feel better about consumerism and live more healthfully. The football-sized parking lots and meat-centered menus, however, still contradict the retailers’ green switch-a-roo. "

INTERVIEW WITH DENNIS KUCINICH,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/interview-with-dennis-kucinich,"NOVEMBER 10, 2008","Dennis Kucinich’s rise out of poverty in Cleveland to being elected, at age 31, the youngest mayor of that city (or any other major city in US history) reveals an exceptional capacity to set and achieve goals. The oldest of seven children, his working-class family was so poor that they were sometimes homeless, bringing harsh life lessons that shaped his worldview. “My formative experiences taught me compassion for those who are struggling,” Kucinich says. “I can understand firsthand the imperative of human unity, of how we need to live together with the intention of creating a better nation and a more peaceful world.” This concern for the welfare of others is reflected in the broad range of progressive issues Kucinich has worked on during his previous six terms in the House of Representatives, from campaign-finance and health-care reform to sustainable agriculture, food safety, and civil liberties. Kucinich plays a leading role in many important animal-protection causes. He helped secure increased funding for enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, and co-sponsored successful legislation to promote humane alternatives to animal testing and ban the importation of products made from dog or cat fur. Kucinich was the only member of Congress to vote against the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, a law that threatens Constitutionally protected free speech. For Kucinich, this is an issue that affects both human and animal rights. “If protesters are branded as ‘terrorists,’ people may be afraid to stand up for animals. Animals will then suffer even more because the public won’t be as informed about the abuse taking place behind closed doors.” After the Democrats won Congress, Kucinich was appointed Chair of the Government Reform Committee’s newly created Domestic Policy Subcommittee, which oversees dozens of government agencies, among them the FDA and the Department of Agriculture. This puts him in a position to review federal policies affecting millions of people and billions of animals. A vegan since 1995, he credits his diet for the extraordinary levels of health and energy he enjoys. “Being vegan gives me the clarity to make good decisions and a vitality that people want in their leaders.” Q & A with Dennis Kucinich VN: How far would you go to publicize and expose the animal protein/global warming connection?
I don’t think there’s anything that’s taboo in terms of talking about global warming. People need to be aware of the implications of the food that we eat and also of how the food is raised. Having said that, I have never been in the position because of my own choices that I insist that anyone else has to eat that way. VN: You’re not worried someone will say, “Hey, but you are a vegan. You have an agenda here”?
I don’t force that choice on anyone. What I do say is that I think Americans are generally more open to changes in diet and lifestyle than most people give them credit, specifically for health reasons. There is a link between human health and the choices that people make with their diets. Now again, I don’t believe that you can tell anyone what to eat. I think it’s the worst thing in the world to start to tell people—to start to dictate—choices of food. You just can’t do that. But you can show people that if they make choices in a certain way, healthy choices, it might improve the environment. It’s an educational process. "
DENNIS KUCINCH REELECTED,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/dennis-kucinch-reelected,"NOVEMBER 9, 2008","Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, Massachusetts’ greyhounds, and California’s egg-laying hens, veal calves, and pregnant pigs aren’t the only reasons to cheer loudly after the historic November 4 election. Voters in Ohio’s 10th district, which includes the eastern half of Cleveland, returned Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich to office once again. Kucinich, the only vegan in Congress (as far as anyone knows) and staunchly pro-peace, had stiff opposition in both the Democratic primary as well as the general election. Fortunately, the progressive policymaker, first elected to Congress in 1996, prevailed. You may now breath easier. "
OBAMA AND POLLAN,https://vegnews.com/2008/11/obama-and-pollan,"NOVEMBER 9, 2008","Everyone knows that one month before Election Day, the NY Times published an 8,000-word treatise by acclaimed author Michael Pollan entitled “Farmer-in-Chief.” Pollan laid out the current state of agriculture, warts and all. The Obama camp asked for a “one- to two-page summary” of the article, which Pollan balked at, saying if he could have said everything in two pages, he would have. Turns out it didn’t matter; Obama apparently read the letter anyway, quoting it in a Time interview, and going as far as acknowledging that “our agriculture sector actually is contributing more greenhouse gases than our transportation sector.” How about Pollan for Secretary of Agriculture?

This new contamination comes on the heels of news that melamine-tainted milk sickened more than 50,000 Chinese children, along with reports of contaminated animal feed last year. The USDA is testing animal products from China, such as milk and eggs, “as necessary,” according to The New York Times.

Molecules in the meat, called Neu5Gc, amass in cells and function as a magnet if exposed to the potentially deadly strain. This “priming” makes it easier for the toxins to enter the blood stream, putting frequent meat-eaters at a higher risk of bacteria-related illness. Fruits and vegetables do not contain these levels of Neu5Gc, making herbivores less susceptible than their meat-eating counterparts. "

In a recent study, health officials found six of 35 vegetarian products to contain beef, pork, and chicken—a shock to the approximate 2 million vegetarians living in the Taiwanese capital. The non-veggie foods—vegetarian-pork meatballs and vegetarian fish balls, specifically—lacked proper labeling, prompting Chiang Yu-mei, Taipei’s director of the Food and Drug Division, to implement a new certification system to protect veg-friendly consumers.

Thanks to help from the Environmental Protection Agency, a handful of UPS delivery trucks now tout something sexier under its hood: a new, EPA-patented hydraulic-hybrid system. The cutting-edge technology allows trucks to capture and store energy just as a battery does, allowing the vehicles to recover 70 percent of the energy normally wasted on braking (which saves on fuel and limits harmful emissions). The first group of hydraulic-hybrid trucks will be deployed this winter in Minneapolis, Minn. While the brown fleet might seem ordinary, it’s what’s under the hood that counts. "

TAINTED PET FOOD,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/tainted-pet-food,"OCTOBER 17, 2008","Something was wrong with Grover. The British Shorthair was always a hearty eater, but suddenly he wouldn’t touch the cat food he normally loved. An urgent visit to the vet gave Emily Tompkins, Grover’s guardian, some grave news: he was suffering from kidney failure. A few days in the hospital and some TLC put Grover on the road to recovery. Even his appetite was returning. “So I gave him the same food he always eats,” says Tompkins. Sadly, it would be several weeks before the pet-food manufacturer warned the public their food was killing cats and dogs. By then, Grover had relapsed and was gone. The massive recall that was finally announced to the public on March 16, 2007, affected some 200 brands of dog and cat food. Though the crisis eventually involved many pet-food manufacturers—including American Nutrition, Blue Buffalo, Chenango Valley Pet Food, and Iams—it was Menu Foods, the largest maker of wet cat and dog food in North America, that initiated the recall. The tragedy began to unfold in February 2007, when animal guardians like Tompkins started complaining to Menu Foods that dogs and cats were dying after consuming its pet food. Canada-based Menu Foods began testing its food on animals in February, reportedly killing seven of them. Finally, on March 15, the company alerted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that they would be issuing a recall of their pet food the next day. (Menu Foods had not returned phone calls for this article.) The FDA mobilized a team of inspectors, who arrived at Menu Foods’ plants in Kansas and New Jersey on the day of the recall. By the end of March, the FDA had found a contaminant—melamine—in wheat gluten (used to thicken the gravy in wet pet foods) and traced it to China. Then, in April, they discovered melamine in rice protein, also imported from China. Things looked suspicious. Melamine, a nitrogen-rich chemical derived from coal, is used to make plastic and fertilizer, it has no business in food ingredients. But, in China, melamine is quietly used as a cheap additive in livestock feed because its high nitrogen content makes it appear as protein in food tests, fooling farmers into thinking they’re buying high-protein feed. The FDA discovered another chemical in the imported wheat gluten and rice protein that shouldn’t be present: cyanuric acid. In the United States, this chemical is added to swimming pools to prevent sunlight from degrading the chlorine. Like elamine, yanuric acid is used to falsely boost protein levels in animal feed and is generally harmless if ingested. While melamine and cyanuric acid are not especially toxic on their own, researchers now know that when combined, the two chemicals quickly form insoluble crystals. In a dog or cat, these crystals obstruct the kidneys, leading to renal failure, a rapid decline in health, and, frequently, death. Rendered Unhealthy
The heartbreaking events of last spring illustrate just how precarious pet-food safety is. Like agribusiness, which puts a pricey marketing spin on meat, eggs, and dairy foods, the $13-billion-a-year pet industry goes to great expense to make consumers feel good about pet food. What’s not to like? Well, for one thing, dog and cat food has become a dumping ground for slaughterhouses: heads, intestines, spinal cord tissue, udders, hooves, and other animal remains considered unfit for human consumption are turned into profit by feeding them to Fido and Fluffy. Moreover, rendering plants sell many pet-food manufacturers material called “tankage,” which may contain parts of animals accidentally killed by vehicles, ingredients high in hormone or pesticide residues, expired meat, zoo animals, livestock ear tags, euthanized animals and their flea collars, Styrofoam packaging, and plastic bags. Other contaminants that have been found in commercial dog and cat foods include restaurant grease—complete with high concentrations of dangerous free radicals and trans—fatty acids-antibiotic residues, moldy grain, PCBs, hazardous preservatives, and viral, bacterial, protozoal, fungal, and prion contaminants, the last of which can cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as mad cow disease. Among the industry’s most controversial practices is using so-called “4-D meat.” Flesh from disabled, diseased, dying, or dead animals (who died in transit to the slaughterhouse) may not be allowed on the butcher’s counter, but it’s perfectly acceptable in your best friend’s bowl, even if the meat is filled with cancerous tissue and pharmaceuticals. The result is a pathogenic smorgasbord that has contributed to a decline in health among companion animals, says Armaiti May, DVM. “Diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, digestive disorders, cystitis, kidney and liver disease, skin problems, obesity, thyroid dysfunction, and various cancers are becoming more common in our domesticated animals,” she says. “This increase in disease incidence is attributed in part to commercial pet foods.” Ciao, Commercial Chow?
All this leaves consumers asking an obvious question. “Are pet foods safe? Sure, as safe as your and my food,” says Paul Pion, DVM, president of the Veterinary Information Network, a web-based group that counts 30,000 veterinarians and vet students as members. “At the same time, no system is perfect or can guarantee every ingredient every single day, and so there is always room for inadvertent problems, whether it be E. coli in a spinach field or some unforeseen contaminant in a bag of potato chips or dog food. None of us can ever be 100-percent certain unless we grow and prepare all our own foods.” Taking control of our companion animals’ health is critical, observes Veterinarian Michael W. Fox, co-author of Not Fit for a Dog: The Truth About Commercial Dog and Cat Food Fox, who has been researching pet food for 30 years. He believes the best way guardians can ensure the welfare of their animal companions is to make food at home, thus reducing the incidence of chronic degenerative diseases and endocrine and immune system disorders. Courting Closure
Some consumers are fighting back. As animal guardians like Emily Tompkins cope with the grief and anger shared by thousands of others, the largest pet-food recall in US history could result in a record number of lawsuits. Adding insult to injury, however, the law regards animals as property—things with no more intrinsic value than lawn tools or stereo equipment—denying anguished guardians any compensation for their emotional distress. Of course, regardless of the outcome, no lawsuit can ever assuage the heartache of losing a loved one. “Our house is not a home,” says Tompkins, who has yet to adopt another cat more than a year later. “Grover is still the little guy in my heart.” "

BAD BIOFUEL?,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/bad-biofuel,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","Good green citizens are demanding cleaner fuels for their vehicles, but using soybeans might not be the seemingly obvious solution. Biodiesel made from soybeans is one possible solution, right? Well, not so fast. Soybeans used for fuel are grown throughout South America. Rainforests and savannas are being converted to farmland, which means that wildlife habitats are being destroyed at an alarming rate. In addition, soybeans grown for biofuels are not produced using organic methods. The repercussions of thousands of tons of pesticides and petroleum-based fertilizers impacts the ground water, soil, and health of local communities. Most of our cars in the United States are gas or ethanol powered, but soy biodiesel is popular in Europe. The demand places a huge pressure on farmers to increase soybean acreage and squeeze out other crops. “Biodiesel only makes sense on cultivated land. If you are ripping up rainforest, you are contributing to global warming. You erase any global warning benefits of biofuel by converting forest to farmland,” says Bill Freese, a science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety. As we run out of fossil fuels, the issue of biofuel will need to be closely examined. What we can do now is monitor our own consumption habits. Take public transportation. Ride our bikes. Convert our cars to recycled veggie oil. Continue to be skeptical and informed about your choices. As consumers, we can protest corporate greed by purchasing non-genetically engineered foods. "
VEGAN IN MONTRÉAL,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/vegan-in-montreal,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","Montreal is an herbivore’s dream, brimming with delightful cafés, charming farmers’ markets, scenic parks, seasonal festivals and street fairs, and more than a dozen vegetarian restaurants.

PICKING THE RIGHT CHRISTMAS TREE,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/picking-the-right-christmas-tree,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","For apartment dwellers, space comes at a premium and it’s not always possible to squeeze in a lush Douglas fir during the holidays. Luckily, this doesn’t mean you have to go treeless. Here are some options for those in small spaces:  Bonsai trees
You can literally ‘trim the tree’ with these demure designer bushes. Shaping bonsai trees is an ancient Japanese art, and can be a very calming experience. Though bonsais may not be as flashy as their Western counterparts, can’t we all use an extra moment of zen around the holidays? Rosemary bushes
Readily available in home-improvement and garden stores, live, cone-shaped rosemary bushes have the look and feel of traditional trees, but miniature. Great for those who are sensitive to strong pine smells, rosemary bushes come with their own distinctive scent. From teacup size to two feet tall, you can answer the need for holiday cheer and your entire year’s worth of rosemary all in one tree. Live trees
Still feel raw about cutting down a tree? Then don’t. Live trees are a great option, as they are smaller than most traditional trees, but bigger than bonsais or bushes. After the holidays, find an appealing spot and plant it. If you have a deck or porch, the tree can sit happily in its little pot year round and be brought inside during the holidays. "
GMO SAFETY SCANDAL,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/gmo-safety-scandal,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","Bill Freese is a science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety (CFS) who works to promote sustainable agriculture. He says Monsanto, an agricultural biotech company, has the largest financial stake in the future of genetically engineered (GE) soy. “Monsanto is the only purveyor of GE soy,” says Freese. “They have patents on processes used to GE the seed and on the genes themselves.” Monsanto owns the patent for Roundup Ready soybeans. Roundup Ready (RR) soy is genetically engineered to withstand glyphosphate (the main chemical in Roundup) fertilizers. The original intention of RR soy was to displace the use of other herbicides and rely exclusively on glyphosphate herbicide, to which the plant is genetically altered to be “immune.” So, the weeds die, but not the soy. In reality, farmers are using more herbicides and seeing annual increases in the amount of chemicals used to treat soy crops in order to attain the same results. In the United States, 90 percent of all soy grown is Roundup Ready. That means farmers apply Roundup directly to the plants. Freese says, “Monsanto says it’s safe, but there have been reports that pesticide applicators and agricultural workers have a higher risk of having children born with neurological behavior problems. Studies show higher incidences of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemia. It inhibits the process of making sex hormones and is responsible for reproductive issues.” Freese says that Roundup has been found in ground water, and has also been found to be toxic to frogs, even at small concentrations. Then again, it’s neither environmental sustainability nor concern for human health that drives multinational corporations-yet. Farmers are required to buy new seed each year and are prohibited from saving seeds from the prior year’s yield for replanting. Freese says, “Monsanto sues farmers for saving seeds. Farmers need to buy seeds for each crop, levied with heavy surcharges.” Many farmers have been sued (and defeated) for possession of “stolen” or saved seeds even when RR seeds on neighboring farms migrate and contaminate their organic crops. "
TOXIC MATTRESSES,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/toxic-mattresses,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","Small-business owner Leora Hornick’s allergies had always been a problem, but as she got older, her symptoms—runny nose, itchy eyes, scratchy throat, persistent fatigue—continued to plague her. Visits to traditional medical doctors brought no relief, so Hornick took her health into her own hands, researching alternative remedies and looking for the root cause of her maladies. To her surprise, all evidence pointed an accusing finger at an unlikely source: her mattress. Unlike the products we consume, the surfaces we sleep on aren’t legally mandated to include an ingredients list, leaving many consumers unaware of the chemical stew lurking beneath the cushy pillow top and satin piping of their conventional mattresses. In addition to being treated with a flame-retardant cocktail of boric acid, formaldehyde, melamine, antimony trioxide, decabromodiphenyl oxide, and other chemicals, mattresses are often made with petroleum-based foams that off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs) while we sleep. Consumer advocate Mark Strobel has devoted years to researching the adverse health effects of mattress flame-retardants and says one of the most common—antimony trioxide—is one of the worst. “Prolonged exposure can cause your heart to beat irregularly or stop, and can lead to miscarriages, birth defects… It’s real nasty stuff.” Armed with this knowledge, Hornick gave her old bedding the heave-ho in favor of an organic version, and—as if by magic—nearly all her allergy symptoms vanished. Considering we spend one-third of our lives in bed, it only makes sense that we’d want to invest—and thoroughly investigate—all of our options. “People don’t want this toxic soup in their lives anymore,” says Hornick. “They’re already eating organic food and using organic cleaning products. This is just the next step.” "
GREENWASHING OR GREEN?,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/greenwashing-or-green,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","The super sizing of the green movement has been met with large-scale skepticism. Are mainstream corps just capitalizing on consumers’ green guilt? Does green marketing equal green morals or just green dollar bills? Does it matter? On the potential dangers of green fashion going mainstream, organic jeans maven Tierra Del Forte says there’s a real fear of greenwashing within the industry; a fear that “people take on the language and the marketing without changing their practices.” She also adds that there is the fear of factory-farmed organic cotton and of fast and cheap production. She stresses the internet’s role in increasing accountability and “transparency of companies,” and thinks the savvy consumer can confirm that these companies are acting ethically with just a few clicks. Today, less than one percent of all cotton is grown organically. That startlingly low figure is reason enough for her company to exercise corporate responsibility, according to Lisa Sandberg of H&M. In fact, when it first began mixing organic cotton into its baby collection in 2004, it didn’t even actively market it. About its motivation, Sandberg remarks, “It really would make us happy to help grow organic cotton around the world… It’s more than a trend for us; we’re really trying to promote organic cultivation to set an example for other retailers to do the same.” While making environmental strides may offer big payoffs in the do-gooder department, every company must weigh the expenses and the benefits of going green. The struggle is a delicate one. Sandberg explains that because H&M purchases materials in such large quantity, it is able to offer organic cotton-even though it still costs more-without passing the added costs on to the consumer. "
BANNING PROCESSED MEATS,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/banning-processed-meats,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","The hot dog may no longer be the pinnacle of culinary art in school cafeterias thanks to The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM). Dr. Neal Barnard, head of the organization, spearheaded the initiative, petitioning the USDA to remove processed meat from school menus. Barnard says 58 scientific studies point to processed meat as one of the culprits increasing the risk of colon cancer. However, The School Nutrition Association says schools follow strict nutrition guidelines, and scientific studies on processed meats are not conclusive. The hot dog may be on a roll for now, but it’s losing heat fast… "
VEGAN FAST-FOOD JOINTS,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/vegan-fast-food-joints,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","The vegetarian food market is expected to grow to $1.7 billion in sales by 2010, up a half billion from 2005. And because sometimes we still need a quick bite on the run, now is the time to get to know a few of the mavericks bringing healthy, veg fast-food to a freeway off-ramp near you. Zen Burger (New York City)
Their proprietary faux-meat products appear in such customer favorites as the ZenBeef Burger, ZenSausage Burrito, ZenShrimp Basket, and the vegan ZenHarvest Burger. Washed down with fair-trade iced coffee, organic salad, and vegan soft-serve ice cream, ZenBurger’s meals may get you just a little closer to enlightenment. Gobo (New York City)
Who needs raw beef when you can indulge in Avocado Tartare with Wasabi-Lime Sauce? Send spaghetti and meat-sauce packing with Green Tea Noodles with Vegan Bolognese Sauce. A great vino to go with dinner is a must. Gobo’s sommelier Hervé Pennequin was a 2003 candidate for best sommelier in the world. Herbivore (San Francisco)
Try fresh and tasty plant-based variations of classics such as moussaka, gnocchi, or macaroni and “cheese.” If you’re an imbiber, try quenching your thirst on a gingery fruit-juice cocktail made with soju (Korean rice and barley spirits). VG burger (Boulder)
VG offers five different burger options, from nut to black bean and beyond. Of course, you’ll want fries with that-especially since they’re baked, not deep—fat fried. Top it all off with a milkshake blended with soy, rice, or hemp ice cream. Native Foods (Southern California)
Standouts from this varied, all-vegan menu include Save the Chicken Wings, the Howard Lyman-inspired Mad Cowboy Bowl-a baked potato topped with barbecue faux-chicken skewers and roasted veggies drenched in ranch dressing—and the Philly Peppersteak Sandwich. Hillside Quickie (Seattle)
Every unique menu item boasts mouthwatering ingredients, but The Crazy Jamaican—a jerk-tofu burger with ripe plantains and grilled sweet onions-is one of its most popular dishes. Soul Vegetarian (Los Angeles)
Comfort and soul foods get an impeccable makeover: sweet potato pie, broccoli quiche, and savory corn bread. Focusing on highly flavorful “transitional” foods, the menu is influenced by the flavors of many cultures, including Mexican, Middle Eastern, and African. Veggie Grill (Southern California)
Sweetheart Chili Fries made from sweet potatoes, Sante Fe Crispy Chickin’ sandwich, or the Chop-Chop Chef Salad will have you sated from lunch straight through to dinnertime. Café Gratitude (San Francisco)
Try I Am Sassy, a virgin margarita made with agave and fresh watermelon, or I Am Graceful, a dish of quinoa, fresh veggies, and Indian coconut-curry sauce. "

POLITICS OF PROP. 2,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/politics-of-prop-2,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","This November 4, California voters will choose whether to ban three of agribusiness’ most controversial confinement systems-veal crates for calves, gestation crates for pregnant pigs, and battery cages for egg-laying hens. If the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act wins more than 50 percent of the vote, it will set a new precedent for animal protection by improving the lives of more farmed animals than any voter initiative in US history, while making California the first state to outlaw battery cages. Every year, factory farms in California confine nearly 20,000 breeding sows in two-foot-wide gestation crates that prevent them from even turning around during their four-month-long pregnancies. They also condemn approximately 19 million egg-laying hens for their entire lives to battery cages that provide less area for each chicken than an 8-1/2-by-11-inch sheet of paper. “The vast majority of Californians-vegan, vegetarian, or meat- eater-agree that giving animals raised for food enough room to turn around and extend their limbs is a very modest request,” says Paul Shapiro, senior director of HSUS’ Factory Farming Campaign. “There’s sure to be a well-funded misinformation campaign from animal agribusiness, but voters are not going to be fooled, especially as they learn more about these abuses.” Lee Hall, legal director for Friends of Animals questions whether husbandry campaigns truly cultivate respect for animals or merely reinforce their status as commodities. “Across the planet, animal agribusiness is on the rise,” Hall says. “If not from vegetarian activists, where can global society find a coherent message?” Shapiro has no doubt that a yes vot on Prop. 2 is the right vote. “We know with certainty that billions of animals will be used for food production for some time to come, but we can reduce their suffering by banning the most intensive confinement practices.” "
EARTH-FRIENDLY FABRICS,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/earth-friendly-fabrics,"OCTOBER 8, 2008","It’s almost officially fall, and that means one thing: fall fashion! As the weather begins to turn chilly, it’s time to think about the best ways to bundle up. Since we all know the cruelty inherent in wool and cashmere, and the environmental havoc wreaked by conventionally grown cotton, finding alternative fabrics is more important than ever. Here are our favorite animal- and earth-friendly threads, any of which will keep you warm, stylish, and ethical through the fall and winter months. Bamboo
Comparable to cotton and silk, bamboo gets an “A” for its list of benefits: organic, sustainable, biodegradable, and extremely comfortable. Even better, the world’s fastest growing plant doesn’t require fertilizers or pesticides. PET
Made from recycled plastic soda bottles, this polyester finds new life as warm fleece hoodies. After the bottles are separated at recycling plants, they’re chopped, melted, and stirred. The resulting liquid is thick and yields polyester strands, which are stretched to make threads. Recyclable polyester
Recycled second-quality fabrics are used to make clothing out of clothing. Some companies even have garment recycling programs where used clothes are reborn good-as-new. Hemp
This fabric’s been around for a long time, but is experiencing a revival in environmental circles because it requires no pesticides and yields two to three times as much fiber as cotton. Soy fabric
A renewable natural resource and byproduct of food production, soy wear is easy to clean and is close to wool in its heat retention. First made into a snazzy suit for Henry Ford in the 1940s, the demand for soy is on the rise thanks to conscious consumers. Organic cotton
This choice, quickly gaining popularity, is poised to eclipse traditional cotton, which accounts for half of all pesticide use in the US and a quarter of that used throughout the world. "
SURPRISING FARM SUBSIDIES,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/surprising-farm-subsidies,"OCTOBER 7, 2008","When talking about subsidies, most experts fail to mention that more than seven times more grain is fed to farmed animals each year than is processed for biofuel production. And did you also know that farmers—primarily commercial ones—who grow commodity crops such as corn and wheat receive the most subsidies? Some of the other subsidized crops may prove slightly more shocking. Here are a few of the farm bill’s lesser-known inclusions: Wool. Due to dependence on imported wool to meet demand for military uniforms during WWII and the Korean War, wool was declared a strategic material in 1954. Although this title has long been revoked, subsidies for the wool industry still exist, and more than 70,000 farmers receive payments. Tobacco. From 1995 through 2006, more than $530 million was spent in tobacco subsidies. While direct payments are no longer subsidized, buyouts are still available to farmers. Sugar beets. That’s right, not regular beets, from which we derive vitamin C, iron, and potassium, but sugar beets from which we derive-you guessed it-sugar. Sugar beets require four times the land that sugar cane does. "
HYNDE’S NEW VEGAN RESTAURANT,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/hyndes-new-vegan-restaurant,"OCTOBER 7, 2008","Musician Chrissie Hynde of the rock group, The Pretenders, is planning to expand her vegan-restaurant empire into the Big Apple—at the site of Ground Zero’s Freedom Tower. “There’s been so much horrific blood and guts and violence there that it’d be fitting to open a cool restaurant where no mangled, burnt bodies are on the menu,” Hynde said to PETA’s Senior Vice President, Dan Mathews.” After her recent success with Vegeterrannean in Akron, Ohio, Hynde aims for the bigger picture, possibly expanding into both New York City and Las Vegas in hopes of spreading the cruelty-free word—and plumping up the Apple, vegan style.

Oh, that’s right, it’s the nasty, cruel, unnecessary dairy! The rich flavor of the nut-based cheeses is perfectly paired with crackers and fresh fruit on a platter, or served on crostini with a glass of your favorite wine. Hemp nuts, cashews, and macadamia nuts make the substantial base for this delectable delicacy. "
GIRLIE GIRL ARMY GOES LIVE,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/girlie-girl-army-goes-live,"OCTOBER 7, 2008","Meet Chloé Jo Berman, whose life took a turn for the fabulous when she discovered her latent passion for animal rights. “It was literally instantaneous,” Berman says of her decision to make over her career when she went vegan. Berman has always used her seductive quality to draw attention to her causes, and is the first to admit that “people are titillated by things that are sexy. I mean look at Skinny Bitch-she made veganism sexy, she made it commercial, and that’s kind of what I’ve done with my newsletter.” The newsletter to which she refers is entitled “The Girlie Girl Army: Your Guide to Glamazon Living,” which goes out to 15,000 subscribers across the United States. “The way that I’m getting all this interest and mainstream press is, ‘Here’s a great place to get the best couture deals and the best new lipstick,’ and there’ll be a link about factory farming.” Sneaky? Maybe. Effective? Yes. Sure, Berman knows that her readers are picking up on her not-entirely-subtle animal agenda. “As I’ve become more involved and more political, so has the newsletter evolved. I’ve definitely gotten at least 30 to 40 vegan converts just from my newsletter,” she says. Is veg just another fad that the masses will pick up and then cast aside? In her exuberant-yet-level-headed way Berman says, “I don’t care why they’re doing it so long as they do it, period. But I think it’s very difficult to be a part of this movement and not come in contact with some sort of footage or some sort of literature that makes you think twice and come at things from a moral-scruples perspective. It’s hard not to have your heart moved at some stage in your process.” According to Berman’s upcoming work schedule, people’s hearts are being moved in record numbers, and they want more. She’s working on her forthcoming television show, talking with an agent about a book deal, and recently launched her web empire, girliegirlarmy.com. Add to that already-impressive résumé her latest title: that of Event Coordinator for Farm Sanctuary. With a life packed full of fabulous, animal-friendly gigs, Berman is well on her way to veganizing each and every facet of mainstream media. "
PHUKET VEG FESTIVAL,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/phuket-veg-festival,"OCTOBER 7, 2008","For the first nine days of the ninth Chinese lunar month of every year since the 19th century, vegetarianism in Phuket, Thailand, is religion. Yes, the Chinese Thai community takes their Phuket Vegetarian Festival seriously. It’s not the kind of festival populated by gentle tree huggers in hemp pants playing djembes, doing yoga asanas, and drinking spirulina smoothies. And it’s not for the faint of heart. But itis a colorful event every vegetarian will want to attend, though perhaps not something every vegetarian will wish to participate in. It all started a century-and-a-half ago when a Chinese opera group, while performing for the tin miners of Phuket, fell deathly ill with malaria. Recalling their ancient wisdom for body and mind purification, they adopted a strict vegetarian diet and refrained from alcohol, sex, quarrelling, telling lies, and killing. The epidemic ceased, and they believed the gods had been appeased, so they celebrated wildly—and the religious frenzy continues annually. While pious locals visit, Chinese temples throughout Phuket host extravagant public ceremonies and rituals to honor the gods, eradicate evil spirits, and welcome good fortune, vegetarian tourists will find nirvana in the countless yellow-flagged stalls and markets offering unbelievably delicious “chicken” curries, “beef” steaks, and sweet and sour “pork,” all made without harm to animals. Good religion. No wonder Thailand is called The Land of Smiles! "
DR. COW VEGAN CHEESE,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/dr-cow-vegan-cheese,"OCTOBER 6, 2008","The world of dairy-free cheese can be a scary place, awash with paltry substitutions for a product that is firmly entrenched in the addicted hearts and guts of the non-veg masses. Thankfully, Dr. Cow-a four-year-old, Brooklyn—based company—has brought art back to the cheese-making process, and the resulting nut cheeses are nothing short of awe-inspiring. Rich, full-bodied wheels that would find themselves at home on an ornate serving platter at le plus chic cheese-and-wine cocktail party are now a reality for vegetarians. Like many traditional dairy cheeses, Dr. Cow offers layers of flavor elements that unveil themselves as the cheese softens in your mouth. From smoky macadamia to the milder cashew, each variety in the Dr. Cow line has the luxurious quality of cheese nailed, and comes wrapped in simple wax paper with cleanly designed labels, which gives it a fresh-from-the-specialty-market feel. With a product line expanded to include multiple aged- and fresh-cheese flavors, Dr. Cow actually began as a granola company, producing amaranth-based organic granola. Founders Veronica Schwartz and Pablo Castro-who moved from Argentina to NYC seeking a larger, more open-minded market for their products-transitioned to a raw-foods diet four years ago. It was partly through incorporating raw-cooking techniques, such as dehydration and fermenting, that they came to develop their cheeses. “We researched and studied local and traditional ingredients in order to offer consumers food with high nutritional value that was also sustainable for our environment,” says Schwartz. The concern for quality has come to delicious fruition in what can honestly be described as the first gourmet vegan cheese. By adding bacterial cultures to their various nut—milk bases—the same process by which dairy cheese is made-Schwartz and Castro have revamped centuries-old methods with decidedly modern results. “We think that today, vegan consumers don’t have a real, artisan choice of cheese that they can incorporate in their daily diet. This product opens up a new set of possibilities for them,” says Castro. "

FACTORY-FARM PHASE-OUT?,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/factory-farm-phase-out,"OCTOBER 6, 2008","When The Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Protection report was released this past spring, it caused shock-waves around the country. The landmark study, based on two-and-a-half years of independent research, proposes drastic changes in the way animals are raised for food. The recommendations include phasing out battery cages for egg-laying hens, gestation and farrowing crates for pregnant pigs, and other intensive animal confinement systems within 10 years; banning the force-feeding of ducks and geese to make foie gras; and prohibiting the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics. In addition to taking a strong stance on animal welfare, the Pew Commission also addresses the devastating impact that factory farming has on human health, the environment, and rural economies and culture. The report recommends the formation of a substantive disease-monitoring program to facilitate recalls, stricter pollution regulations for concentrated animal feeding operations, and fundamental market reforms that would enable independent farms to compete with agribusiness conglomerates. California residents wanting to support the Pew Commission’s recommendations should vote yes on Prop. 2, otherwise known as Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act. If enacted, Prop. 2 would phase out battery cages for egg-laying hens and gestation crates for pregnant pigs throughout the Golden State. "

Erykah Badu: I’ve been vegan for two years and vegetarian for 20 years. I used to be a dancer, and so health and vitality have always been important to me. I wouldn’t say it took any one big event, vegetarianism just always made sense to me. [What farmed animals] endure is just terrible. It’s horrible. VN: What do you think of the prevailing misconception that veganism is an elitist, white lifestyle?
EB: I mean we-black people, poor people-we’ve not really been introduced to the injustices behind what we eat. Of course, people who have to worry about finding food, clothing, and shelter are not going to be as concerned about what they’re eating. I mean, you almost have to have a record deal to shop at Whole Foods! VN: Are people are born with empathy, or is it learned?
EB: It’s both, but it has to be nurtured in children by teaching them to be honest. The more you are honest with yourself, the more you realize that everyone experiences the same pain, and when you see that, you can relate to people. You can be emotionally disturbed by what someone does, but when you realize where they come from, logically, you can understand why. It’s pretty difficult to judge someone when you know you’ve felt exactly the same. VN: Is vegan food the new soul food?
EB: Vegan food is soul food in its truest form. Soul food means to feed the soul. And, to me, your soul is your intent. If your intent is pure, you are pure. "

Luckily for the vegged-out in our Web 2.0 world, if you have an, ahem, beef with someone, you can have your revenge, blog-style. In his book Kitchen Confidential, Bourdain writes, “Vegetarians, and their Hezbollah-like splinter faction, the vegans, are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn… [they] are the enemy of everything good and decent in the human spirit, and an affront to all I stand for, the pure enjoyment of food.” Sarah Boatright Patterson had heard just about enough anti-veg rhetoric from the television chef, so in cyber-perfect response, she started the wickedly funny recipe blog, Hezbollah Tofu. From Roulade of Wild Seitan to Chocolate Mousse, all of Bourdain’s signature dishes are getting a thorough vegan makeover. Ultimately, Boatright Patterson hopes to publish and sell the blog recipes, with proceeds benefiting Farm Sanctuary. “And, of course, the donation will be made in Anthony Bourdain’s name. What better way to counteract his loathing of vegans than to allow “him” to donate to a vegan-oriented charity?” "
ECO-RESORT RANCHO LA PUERTA,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/eco-resort-rancho-la-puerta,"OCTOBER 5, 2008","Rancho la Puerta calls itself the world’s first eco-resort. Founded in 1940 at the foot of Mount Kuchumaa, a native American sacred place, Rancho La Puerta gives guests pure food, opportunities for exercise, and space to reflect. To that end, it’s a Rancho La Puerta requirement that guests stay a full week. “Our founders believed that it takes a week to create a change—or a miracle,” says general manager Roberto Arjona. Whether exploring the brick walking paths on the ranch’s 3,000 acres (much of it undeveloped), discovering new sculptures or lounging in a hammock under an oak tree, Arjona hopes that time at the ranch will recalibrate visitors’ lives and create balance. “We hope guests will take a lot with them and leave behind some of their old habits,” Arjona says. Classes in Pilates, African dance and tennis, as well as bird walks and hikes are scheduled throughout the day, but guests are welcome to skip the programs and just relax. Spa facilities allow guests to deepen their relaxation with a menu of treatments Health-conscious vegetarians will love the food at Rancho La Puerta, which focuses on whole grains and produce grown on the ranch’s own organic farm. Guest Kathy Turken of Phoenix visits the ranch twice a year and says her time there helps her relieve the stress of running two businesses. She loves to go in April and October when wildflowers are in full bloom. “It really is a magical place. It fills a need most of us have to get grounded, get centered,” Turken says. "
"EAT LOCAL, SAVE THE PLANET",https://vegnews.com/2008/10/eat-local-save-the-planet,"OCTOBER 5, 2008","If you really want to lighten your carbon footprint, don’t just go vegan, go locavore. That means buying food locally to avoid the burning of fossil fuels entailed in long-distance transport by truck or rail. The term “locavore” was coined in 2005 by a group of four San Francisco women, and won the prestigious New Oxford American Dictionary Word of the Year Award for 2007. The Locavores continue to encourage Bay Area residents-and people around the country-to only eat foods within a 100-mile radius of their homes during the month of August (and beyond). “Our food now travels an average of 1,500 miles before ending up on our plates,” they write on their website. Community-supported agriculture, farm stands, and farmers markets are good resources for aspiring locavores who want to eat within their foodshed, as are gardens and fruit trees from which you can harvest your own produce. Jennifer Meiser, editor of the Eat Local Challenge website, suggests if you’re interested in become a locavore yourself, trying these 10 tips: "

Of course, we’d prefer that the whole line was vegan, but then we never let the imperfect be the enemy of the good around the VNHQ. Since there are only a few vegan wine standbys that boast trustworthy production methods, it’s nice to have another label to add to your roster for a little variety. "
NAPA’S VEGAN-FRIENDLY RESTAURANT UBUNTU,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/napas-vegan-friendly-restaurant-ubuntu,"OCTOBER 5, 2008","Sandy Lawrence—the owner and mastermind behind Ubuntu—dreamt up a vision for her restaurant to create a place that would appeal to meat eaters and herbivores alike. Intentionally underemphasizing the vegetarian angle is her way to direct diners’ focus to the kitchen’s world-class, plant-based creations that defy categorization. “It is simply exquisite preparation of fresh ingredients—a celebration of our garden bounty—designed for anyone who loves good food,” says Lawrence. At the table, waitstaff dressed in black t-shirts emblazoned with the Ubuntu credo, “Practice humanity toward others,” deliver the daily menu that features roughly 20 unique, mouth-watering offerings that are divided into sections including “bites,” “small plates,” “pizza,” “larger plates,” and “desserts.” Roughly half the menu is vegan, and thankfully, most of the menu’s star attractions are absent of any animal products. The Marcona Almonds ($5), mounded on a plate and covered in a lavender-sugar sea-salt blend, taste like a trip to Provence and are terribly addictive. The equally delicious Chickpea Fries ($6), served with a rich romesco dipping sauce, would have made at least two diners happy if there’d been a few more of them on the plate. Several salads are offered daily, such as the Salad of Baby Beets, Avocado, and Red Quinoa ($10). Artfully arranged on a square plate, the dish is an explosion of color and taste, from the fluffy mounds of beet cream to the tangy rhubarb pickles. Diners accustomed to supersize portions might experience culture shock at the conservative serving size, but the flavor packed into each bite leaves the palate sated. Vegans hankering for a slice of pizza with the rich mouth-feel of cheese will want to make a beeline for any of Ubuntu’s seasonal offerings. Prepared with a creamy, béchamel-type sauce, the Mushroom Bianco pie ($15) will have you dreaming of its thin, chewy crust and healthy smattering of fat, wild mushrooms long after it’s been devoured. Some of the larger plates, such as the Farro with Green Garlic, are offered in half or full-size portions ($14/19), and our server suggested we start small. The warm, bright-green bowl of simmered grains arrived with a small blanket of buttery braised baby carrots, beets, and fresh peas, and, because of its richness, proved filling enough for two. Roughly 45 percent of the produce served at Ubuntu comes from the restaurant’s own organic, biodynamic garden, located just outside Napa at Lawrence’s home. Desserts are conceived and prepared by Chef Jeremy’s wife, Deanie Fox, and on this day the vegan offerings include the flashy Creamsicle Float ($8) and the Cupcake of the Day. The former is a visual rhapsody involving striated layers of deep purple elixir and vivid orange sorbet. Tangy, tart, and with a lingering flavor of beets that delivers its bright purple hue, this clever concoction offers taste and novelty in every spoonful. The Cupcake arrives as three quarter-size chocolate cakes topped with a decorative swirl of icing. The diminutive size of these sweet confections—their only downside—left us pondering the idea of ordering seconds before reality—and the memory of the multi—course meal just consumed—kicked in. For diners willing to make the drive, Ubuntu is definitely a destination worth the trek. "
VEGAN ETSY,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/vegan-etsy,"OCTOBER 4, 2008","In a world where children are allowed to manufacture products for consumption thousands of miles away, it’s more than a relief to discover the online ethical vending-haven that is VeganEtsy. The etsy.com web network allows anyone to buy and sell hand-made products. VeganEtsy founder Molly Lorenz, who peddles her own homemade vegan dog-treats on the site, wanted to set up a team that nurtures the veg community, supports vegan business-owners, and contributes to animal-related causes (many members donate a portion of their sales to charities like Farm Sanctuary and Peaceful Prairie). “Just getting the word ‘vegan’ out there does a lot of good,” says Lorenz. “There are a lot of people who want to support vegan-business owners, and this gives them the resources to do just that.” Lorenz, who has had to stop herself from buying every single VeganEtsy product for herself, started the blog to showcase the artisans so consumers can learn as much about the origins of their wares as the products themselves. But the site offers more than just a wide array of adorable, hand-made items (anything from one-of-a-kind jewelry to cruelty-free mitts to tasty treats)-it promotes the vegan lifestyle. "
SOY: SAFE ON SPERM,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/soy-safe-on-sperm,"OCTOBER 4, 2008","The Soyfoods Association of North America (SANA), a non-profit trade association, recently warned that headlines claiming “soy products may lower sperm count” do not tell the whole story. Dr. Tammy Hedlund, a male-fertility researcher from the University of Colorado, specifically criticized a small-scale, preliminary study presented by Dr. Jorge Chavarro, from the Harvard School of Public Health, at a meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Dr. Hedlund pointed out that Chavarro’s study was based on recollected intake of soy rather than specific diets containing soyfoods. The research also failed to establish a negative relationship between soy consumption and sperm mobility or quality, both key factors to fertility. The Harvard study conflicts with research sponsored by the US government and National Institutes of Health in which controlled amounts of isoflavones from soy were fed to subjects and no effect on quantity, quality, or motility of sperm was observed. While it’s true that soy is one of the top 10 most allergenic foods (as with any food allergy, soy can produce a number of allergic reactions including rashes, intestinal distress, and bloating), as long as you don’t have known allergies, it’s probably okay to go ahead and dig into your edamame, tempeh, tofu, miso, natto, soy nuts, and soymilk. Just remember: moderation—with anything you consume—is one of the keys to good health. "
VEGAN IN TURKEY,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/vegan-in-turkey,"OCTOBER 4, 2008","Bisected by the Bosphorous Strait, the city formerly known as Constantinople bears the unique distinction of spanning two continents (Europe on the left, Asia on the right), and it once served as a major port and as capital of the Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires. The overlapping of empire and religion—the Byzantines were mainly Christian and the Ottomans, Muslim—has left an unrivalled heritage, and though Turkey’s now considered a secular democracy, Istanbul’s unique legacy draws millions of tourists and immigrants each year. Turning onto a side street to escape the rush-hour crowd, we stumble upon the 350-year-old covered spice market known as the Misir Çarsisi, or Egyptian Bazaar (so-called because most spices were imported from Egypt). A chef’s dream, the market’s 100 stalls display tubs of salt-covered grape leaves and tangy olives, pungent sacks of finely-ground curry powder, paprika and chili peppers, and rows of nuts and dried figs. A glance down its thoroughfare shows a veritable rainbow, an artist’s palette of colors. We browse the stalls and sample several flavors of lökum, jellied candies flavored with pistachio or rose water known as Turkish Delight, and giggle at the pistachios wrapped in pastry labeled “Turkish Viagra.” Next, we visit acclaimed restaurant Çiya Sofrasi, one of three establishments run by world-renown nouveau-Turkish cuisine maestro, Musa Dagdeviren. With the aid of a tiny phrasebook, our waiter helps us choose from a generous selection of vegan offerings, including the tomato-based Ezogelin soup, falafel, eggplant salads and, for dessert, slices of pumpkin sprinkled with walnut. As the meal ends, the sun begins to sink and the mosques’ loudspeakers crackle with the evening Adhan, heralding the end of the day, and giving us much to look forward to tomorrow.

VEGAN BLOG VEGANS OF COLOR,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/vegan-blog-vegans-of-color,"OCTOBER 3, 2008","Johanna Eeva found it hard to feel accepted as a person of color in vegan circles, so she did what any smart woman with writing chops and a desire to engage with her community would do: she started her own blog. The 31-year-old New York City-based blogger launched Vegans of Color in late 2007 as a reaction to the frustration she experienced not having enough online discussion centered on veganism and AR from a people-of-color perspective. “There often hasn’t been a sense that people understand and value the issues that I deal with,” she says. “It’s vital for vegans of color to realize that other vegans of color exist, and to be able to discuss these issues in a space that focuses on their own experience.” Today, Eeva’s blog attracts readers, commentors, and bloggers of every stripe who are interested in subjects as varied as veganism and white privilege, adoptable animals, cultural imperialism, and other important issues we should all be talking about in our everyday discourse-online and otherwise. One blog entry might discuss the conundrum of whether or not to attend a work-related event that just happens to be held at a zoo, or whether AR groups should use the holocaust as analogy for the plight of abused and exploited animals. Whatever the topic of the hour may be, you can be certain that it will be relevant to any critically thinking, 21st century vegan. "
IN VITRO MEAT,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/in-vitro-meat,"OCTOBER 3, 2008","This past April, scientists from around the world met in Norway at the first international In Vitro Meat Symposium to discuss the potential for mass-producing lab-grown meat. According to a new economic analysis unveiled at the event, researchers project that, within a few years, meat could be grown in giant bioreactors for about $5,500 a ton if technological developments continue. At about $3.50 per pound, that’s less than what most consumers now pay for hamburger. To speed up the process, PETA is offering a $1 million prize to whoever successfully manufactures and markets the first in-vitro chicken-meat product. Likewise, LA Times vegetarian columnist Patt Morrison cheers “Franken-Meat” creators on for ethical and environmental reasons. “Fewer (animals killed)-fewer greenhouse gases, more available water, more forest, more open space, more available land. I like that recipe,” she says. “And McDonald’s can change all those signs to read ‘Billions SAVED.’” As well as being better for animals, researchers claim cultured meat would be healthier because the nutritional content could be controlled and customized. “Meat weighs heavy with unhealthy baggage,” says Michael Greger, MD, Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture for The Humane Society of the United States’ (HSUS’) Farm Animal Welfare department. "
VEG IN GERMANY,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/veg-in-germany,"OCTOBER 3, 2008","“Good luck finding veggies in the land of wurst,” one of my friends scoffed just before I moved to Germany. “It’s going to be tough,” my vegan German husband agreed. “They even cook French fries in lard.” How bad could it be? I thought. Many famous vegetarians—including Wagner, the 19th century composer, and Dr. Albert Schweitzer—had once called Germany home. I felt certain my vegan lifestyle would be nicely accommodated in my adopted homeland. In a country with 51 members of the current parliament registered Green, where some of the strictest recycling laws on the planet are enforced, how could my diet not be catered to? Fortunately, a quick trip to the former West German capital city of Bonn confirmed my hunch. Directly across from the central train station, located off one of the main pedestrian thoroughfares, sat the Cassius Garten and Café (cassiusgarten.de), an all-vegetarian bistro and buffet with several vegan offerings. Walking into the restaurant at 3pm on a Monday, I was amazed at the crowd inside. No less than 50 people, from college students and professors to elderly couples, scattered throughout the two-story atrium, their trays weighted down with colorful build-your-own salads and scoops of seitan stir-fry. My hopes for a strong vegetarian community in my new homeland grew. We discovered Oekoma (oekoma.de), a commune in Duesseldorf where the residents are so dedicated to the ideals of a peaceful lifestyle that they run a small organic foods store (known in German as either Naturkost or Bioladen) and offer daily vegan macrobiotic lunches. They require reservations with at least two hours’ notice to keep food from going to waste, so we didn’t get to sample the fare, but the intimate, family-like atmosphere helped us to finally feel at home. "
VEG PROGRESS,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/veg-progress,"OCTOBER 3, 2008","Freya Dinshah was born into a vegetarian family in England. Her earliest memories include outdoor lunches with a local vegetarian group followed by trips down the river Mole in a rowboat to a picnic site for tea time. “Over the years, the boat began to leak,” she recalls. “Some rowed and Some bailed.” It seems an apt metaphor for the vegetarian movement during her adolescence in the 1950s, at least in America. Following World War II, unprecedented economic prosperity, suburbanization, and the introduction of factory farming drove meat and dairy consumption to an all-time high. Aside from the occasional beatnik or “health nut,” there weren’t many vegetarians around in those days. A rarity among rarities, Dinshah became a vegan at age 18. This was in 1959, and even she was not exactly sure how her health would fare. But that same year, she moved to the US and married Jay Dinshah, founder of the American Vegan Society, an organization that played a pioneering role in bringing plant-based eating to the states. Though veganism was still in its infancy in the early ’60s, the Dinshahs enjoyed a far-ranging diet-from brown rice and dal to homemade deep-dish pizza with soy cheese—even without all of today’s modern culinary conveniences. They made their own almond milk, as well as “ice cream” (by putting bananas and cashew nuts in the blender and freezing the results). The only meat alternatives available at the time came in cans and were made by Loma Linda, a company run by Seventh Day Adventists. Times certainly have changed—mainly for the better. In the last decade, vegetarianism and, especially, veganism, have become increasingly visible in mainstream culture, while more and better-tasting meatless options continue to show up on supermarket shelves and restaurant menus. there are also more social institutions to support the veg lifestyle today—from vegetarian societies to vegan eateries-as well as an increased awareness and acceptance of vegetarianism among the general public. Though we are still a minority living in a carnivorous civilization, vegetarians now have more resources, an improved image, and a voice. Hurray for that! "
ANIMAL-RIGHTS ACTIVIST KAREN DAWN,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/animal-rights-activist-karen-dawn,"OCTOBER 2, 2008","If the first thing that pops to mind when you hear “animal rights” isn’t a celebrity-studded party with phenomenal food and a general air of complete fabulousness, perhaps you haven’t met Karen Dawn. The woman who started DawnWatch—an eight-year-old animal rights listserv that keeps subscribers up to date on the media’s coverage of animal issues and encourages feedback in the form of letters to the editor-is on a mission. In her world, animal rights are inextricably linked with non-stop, social-butterfly-style good times, and she’s determined to shed her little ray of sunshine on the movement. In her first book, Thanking the Monkey: Rethinking the Way We Treat Animals, Dawn takes aim at our culture’s perceptions of animals by going through each and every one of the awful ways in which humans abuse and exploit them. That sounds like a party, right? Well, despite the depressing subject matter and with the help of a heap of cartoons, Dawn manages to make the read both funny and effective. “There’s no reason that animal rights can’t be fun and inviting,” says Dawn of the approach she took to her book. “For heaven’s sake-gin’s vegan!” While ordering her very, very dry martinis and tossing her tresses around, Dawn brings all the bluster and bravado you’d expect to find in a nightclub promoter to her work. It just so happens that her “work” is helping raise media awareness and protecting the lives of animals. While the party-girl lifestyle used to be her full-time gig, Dawn says that her life changed dramatically when she read Animal Liberation. “When I sort of found out the extent of the institutionalized cruelty I thought, “Okay, I’m going to devote my life to this.” Since her personal transformation from happy-go-lucky singer/songwriter to happy-go-lucky activist, Dawn has worked with many of the major players in the animal-rights movement, from PETA to Peter Singer. During the past eight years, Dawn has seen coverage of animal stories increase dramatically. “Finally, animal news is considered to be news. It’s becoming more a part of mainstream thought, at last. Still not as much as we would like it to, but at least it’s becoming part of the conversation.” Thanking the Monkey is an access point to that conversation for those unfamiliar with animal rights, whether they are newscasters or your family and friends. Once they read it, just try and stop them from joining the party that we call the vegetarian lifestyle. "
PRIMATES GET PROTECTION,https://vegnews.com/2008/10/primates-get-protection,"OCTOBER 2, 2008","Spain is on the cusp of becoming the first country in the world to offer rights of personhood on a non-human species. The Spanish Parliament’s environmental committee recently voted in favor of a resolution, which has majority support, urging the government to comply with the Great Ape Project. Founded by philosophers Peter Singer and Paola Cavalieri in 1993, the project’s goal is “to provide (great apes) with the right to life, the freedom of liberty and protection from torture.” In addition to banning experiments on primates, the law would also prohibit the use of primates in circuses, and require drastic improvements for more than 300 apes currently living in zoos. Spain’s sea change could also have palpable benefits for primates around the world, raising the animal protection bar for other countries. Ultimately, Spain’s stand may be a crucial step towards stemming the international bushmeat trade and averting the extinction of wild apes. Now, if Spain could just get to work on that whole bullfighting thing… "

REDUCING MEAT CONSUMPTION BENEFITS ENVIRONMENT,https://vegnews.com/2002/9/reducing-meat-consumption-benefits-environment,"SEPTEMBER 2, 2002","In a recent article on time.com by reporter Laura Newcomber, she suggests many ways to eat environmentally friendly. Newcomber points to the fact that factory-farmed meat, out of all foods, has the most impact on the planet and to consider consuming less meat or going meat-free once a week. She also mentions that antibiotics are used in animal feed, and therefore consumed by the people who eat meat, pose health risks, and goes on to discuss how dairy cows are routinely fed artificial hormones and the dangers that can affect humans who consume milk. Lastly, Newcomber lists eating mostly produce than any other type of food to ensure the reduction of environmental damage, plus the added benefit to human health. "
